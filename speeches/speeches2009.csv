"1",39,"AFG",64,2009,"First  I would like to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Treki on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. Afghanistan looks forward to working with him over the next year and to strengthening international responses to the crises that we are facing today.  Since its inception the United Nations has been instrumental in addressing the world’s challenges  particularly in the global South. But significant challenges remain unresolved. The growing gap between and within nations in terms of opportunity and prosperity reminds us that we are still far from meeting the ideals and objectives of the Charter of the United Nations for creating a just and secure world.  Strengthening and restructuring United Nations agencies remain pivotal in closing the gap between the objectives of the Charter and the realities of the world. The United Nations is not a forum for lip service. It must embody the ideals of the Charter by providing political and moral direction and leadership. In our increasingly interdependent world and the multilaterally oriented international system  the United Nations must assume greater responsibility for finding collective solutions to our challenges.   The world  and in particular developing nations  is faced with the threat of poverty  underdevelopment  environmental degradation  extremism  fundamentalism  terrorism  culturally based racism  the spread of weapons of mass destruction and the arms race. Rather than just managing and reacting to problems  the United Nations must find ways to address the structural causes of the world’s problems and conflicts. To this end  closer cooperation between the United Nations  the International Criminal Court  international financial organizations and global civil society is vital in moving towards more just and friendly relations among nations.  Our efforts to address new challenges must be followed up by redoubling our commitment to resolve    09-52604 40  remaining historical conflicts  chief among which is the conflict in the Middle East. Afghanistan reiterates its call for the full implementation of United Nations resolutions and regional initiatives for bringing an end to the suffering of the Palestinian nation and creating a safe region for all Middle Eastern nations.  On the eve of the fortieth anniversary of the establishment of the Organization of the Islamic Conference  the Islamic world faces a number of important internal and external questions and issues. Addressing those issues and reviving the prominent role of Muslims in contributing to the progress of humanity and civilization can be achieved only if we  members of the Islamic world  collectively confront the current intellectual stagnation that many of us suffer from. As was the case during the golden era of Islamic history  intellectual freedom and creativity must be elevated to our highest social and political priorities. The Islamic world is in urgent need of an intellectual renaissance. Islamophobia and associating Muslims with a violent minority are additional issues that call all of us  particularly Western nations  to seek effective ways to confront them.   Let me now turn to the situation of my country  Afghanistan. Unfortunately  negative coverage of the situation by international media has overshadowed the many positive trends and developments since the collapse of the Taliban regime in 2001. Alongside our challenges  a new Afghanistan is emerging. That Afghanistan includes an emerging democracy  ascendant State institutions  a nascent civil society  a growing private sector and strong international solidarity.  I can refer to many examples of how that new Afghanistan is advancing. In the fields of education  health  infrastructure  media and economic growth  the generous support and sacrifices of the international community have been vital in our joint and proud achievements in Afghanistan  for which we Afghans remain grateful.  The Afghanistan presidential and provincial elections in August demonstrated the many positive changes. It was the first time in the modern history of Afghanistan that Afghan institutions were tasked with organizing and holding a nationwide election. Taking into account the socio-historic realities of Afghanistan  we passed that national test successfully. In addition to it being our first experience  we were faced with dangerous enemies who did their utmost to disrupt and derail the process by terrorizing Afghan voters. By braving Al-Qaida  the Taliban and other terrorist groups  Afghan voters demonstrated their determination and desire to have a modern  moderate and democratic political system.  As in any emerging democracy  undoubtedly there were irregularities. But one should not assess a young  terrorist-inflicted democracy with the criteria used for old  stable and prosperous democracies. In passing judgement we should be conscious of the context  the process and the full picture  rather than of only one aspect or issue.  In due course  the Independent Election Commission and the Electoral Complaints Commission will announce and certify the final results of the elections. For the sake of the stability and consolidation of our young democratic institutions and processes  it is imperative that all of us respect and support their decision. Continuing efforts to delegitimize and undermine the integrity of the process and our institutions will certainly result in worsening the situation not only for Afghanistan but also for the international community.  Afghanistan still faces significant challenges. Chief among them is terrorism  which enjoys safe havens and institutional support beyond our borders. As long as terrorist infrastructure  including the Taliban leadership  and sanctuaries remain protected  Afghanistan  the region and the world will be at the mercy of terrorists and their totalitarian ideology and objectives. Only by pursuing a comprehensive strategy with adequate resources  effective implementation and  more importantly  strategic patience  can we address our interconnected challenges. The main pillars of such a comprehensive strategy are security  good governance  economic development  regional cooperation and international solidarity.  Afghanistan fully endorses President Obama’s new strategy for Afghanistan and Pakistan and the new assessment by General McChrystal  in particular their emphasis on the need for a comprehensive and long-term strategy. The forthcoming international conference on Afghanistan will be an opportunity for us to review and reiterate our mutual commitment and determination to address Afghanistan’s remaining challenges. We must renew the sense of partnership   41 09-52604  and cooperation between Afghanistan and the international community.   The principles of good governance  mutual accountability and regional cooperation are of the highest priority. There must be a zero tolerance for any drug-related activity or corruption by the Afghan Government or our international partners.  What the Afghan nation expects and deserves from a renewed partnership with the international community is assurance of a long-term commitment and solidarity. Afghans are rightly fearful of being abandoned once again to lawlessness  extremism and external interference. Abandoning the Afghan nation will undermine the spirit of collective cooperation and the ideals of the United Nations and will weaken the moral credibility of those who fail to honour their promises and commitments to Afghanistan for many generations. Furthermore  it will embolden extremists in the region and beyond.  I have full confidence that with the full support and commitment of the family of nations  Afghanistan will be able to overcome the legacy of decades of violence and suffering. We will restore our historic position as a model of cooperation between different cultures and as a regional crossroads and hub for trade  transit  transportation and tourism on the Asian continent."
"2",78,"AGO",64,2009,"First of all  allow me to take this important opportunity to congratulate Mr. Ali Treki on his election to preside over the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. I would like to assure him of the unconditional support of the Republic of Angola in fulfilling his important mission. The delegation of Angola is absolutely positive that under his auspicious leadership  the sixty-fourth session will reaffirm the importance of the General Assembly in the search for consensual solutions to the burning issues affecting humanity  thereby greatly contributing to creating an increasingly safe  free and fair world.  I would also like to express my delegation’s deep appreciation to Mr. Treki’s predecessor  Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann  for the high degree of efficiency and vast expertise with which he conducted the work of the presidency.  Guided by the most elementary sense of justice  on behalf of the Republic of Angola  I express my deepest appreciation to the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  for the excellence with which he has managed to consolidate reforms and ensure the fulfilment of the decisions of the Millennium Summit and other major United Nations conferences  as well as for the commitment that he has consistently shown in placing the needs and development of Africa at the centre of the international agenda. I would also like to praise the Secretary-General for his timely initiative to convene the high-level meeting on climate change.  The Assembly’s sixty-fourth session is taking place in a political  social and economic context of enormous complexity. Ensuring international peace and security  fighting poverty  protecting the environment  ensuring a better future for generations to come  ensuring the rule of law in relations among the members of the international community and promoting and safeguarding human rights — all of these issues are clearly among the major challenges confronting us. Combating organized crime and the implementation of the Anti-Terrorism Strategy are also factors of extreme importance that require the steady    09-52604 32  attention of the United Nations as it calls for more effective measures and a greater commitment from the international community.  These challenges must be added to the list of others to which our Organization must also devote great attention  especially the lack of decisions on disarmament  the persistence of armed conflicts and the consequences of these conflicts for the lives of people  and finally  the issue on the agenda for all Member States — the reform of the Security Council of the United Nations.  We live in a more globalized world  one that is increasingly characterized by substantial economic and social inequality. Hunger and poverty  aggravated by the fact that they are linked to endemic diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis  cause millions of deaths every year and in Africa are devastating an entire generation  dramatically jeopardizing the development and progress of our continent. It is therefore urgent that we reverse this situation  which is consuming our people  putting men and women at the mercy of inducements that inevitably lead to violence and crime and  to some extent  are the cause of some of the serious problems that humanity currently faces.  Food security thus seems to be one of the main concerns of the African continent  due to its importance to health  productivity  social and political stability and economic growth. Angola believes that it is possible to substantially reduce the food security deficit in Africa if the international community comes together around the following fundamental issues.  First  reserves of food and medicines for emergency aid and for people in need should be maintained. Secondly  national and regional integrated strategies and programmes in agriculture  trade  transport  water and vocational training — which can be implemented with the support and experience of the Food and Agriculture Organization  the International Fund for Agricultural Development and other United Nations specialized agencies — should be adopted.  Action plans within the framework of regional initiatives are also extremely important and can contribute to reducing food shortages and combating disease. Among other initiatives  I would like to highlight the New Partnership for Africa’s Development  the 2004 Ouagadougou Declaration and Plan of Action on employment and the eradication of extreme poverty  the Maputo Declaration proposing the allocation of 10 per cent of public expenditure to agriculture and rural development  the Sirte Declaration on agriculture and water  the Abuja Resolution on food safety  and the Abuja and Maputo Declarations on HIV/AIDS  tuberculosis  malaria and other related diseases.  The economic and financial crisis  though of exogenous origin  has also been seriously affecting the growth of African economies  due  among other reasons  to the reduction in asset values and financial assets held abroad  and mainly due to a marked decrease in the price of raw materials that are exported by countries on the continent. Rather than finding interim solutions in order to overcome immediate problems  the entire current economic and financial system should be reviewed. We need to identify ways of restructuring the world so that it serves the interests of all peoples and countries from a global perspective.  My Government welcomes the initiatives that  though insufficient  have been taken in the context of trade liberalization  and we support the idea of reforming the regulatory institutions of the financial and economic world. We also call for greater fluidity and transparency in the transfer of capital to less developed countries.  Similarly  Angola welcomes the various multilateral initiatives  emphasizing the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation  the Africa-South America Conference  the Tokyo International Conference on African Development  the Africa-Europe summit  the India-Africa Forum  the South Korea-Africa summit  and  more recently  the Turkey-Africa summit. The Angolan Government considers that all of these initiatives are of fundamental importance for the development of the least developed countries  which include most countries in Africa  and Angola in particular.  The Secretary-General presented an important report to the high-level meeting on Africa’s development needs (A/63/130)  particularly on the implementation of commitments made by partners of the African continent  which took place on the margins of the Assembly’s sixty-third session. Angola shares the relevant concerns raised by the Secretary-General in that report  especially the references to the importance and urgency of moving from mere expressions of political will to concrete actions  with a comprehensive and vigorous pursuit of the goals envisaged.   33 09-52604   The Secretary-General gave conclusive examples: a reduction of aid levels and commitments; cancellation of the foreign debt of African countries  which is taking a long time to materialize; and the negative effects arising from the failure to complete the World Trade Organization round of negotiations  which will result in fewer opportunities for the African continent. Angola shares all those concerns. As we conclude from all the eloquent statements by the speakers before me  there are no magic solutions or one-size-fits-all models to enable the least developed countries to find easy and immediate answers to development overnight.  As the President is certainly aware  economic growth in Angola has been quite encouraging. The invitation to my country to participate in the summit of the Group of Eight  held in L’Aquila  Italy  on 10 July — which greatly honoured the Angolan Government and people — was unquestionable proof of the international community’s recognition that Angola is on the right path towards promoting sustainable development. Between 2004 and 2007  the national economy accumulated growth of 92.4 per cent in real terms. In barely four years  the value of the gross domestic product almost doubled  with an average annual real growth of approximately 17.8 per cent. In that same period  the country saw a sharp rise in the level of public and private investments  which generated a large number of jobs  in particular in the agricultural sector.  Angola is firmly committed to achieving universal education  as demonstrated by the fact that we have tripled the number of students in our education system. In 2005  as a result of the investments that the Government directed towards the social sector  Angola moved up five positions in the United Nations human development index ranking. And the country is committed to efforts towards achieving the eight Millennium Development Goals. In the area of sports  Angola recently won its tenth African basketball championship  and next January it will host the African Cup of Nations  having built the necessary infrastructure for that significant event for our continent.  Those major accomplishments  achieved in such a short time  fill all Angolans with pride and strengthen their confidence in the future. However  such achievements are possible only in peace and social harmony and when States themselves take on the primary responsibility for the development  progress and well-being of their populations.  Despite the progress already made in Africa in the areas of good governance and the institutionalization of the organs of the African Union  as well as in growth and economic and social development  we must be aware of the difficulties and the long way still to go. I am referring  for example  to the burning issue of promoting peace and security  essential conditions for the development and promotion of human rights.  In that regard  it is important to add that it is essential that the Security Council continue to fund operations for peace and security in Africa and to support the efforts of African States to combat drug trafficking  the illicit arms trade  piracy and terrorism. In addition  I believe it important to emphasize that the strategy of conflict prevention and resolution  in particular the mandates of peacekeeping missions  cannot be separate from measures to combat organized and transnational crime and the relationship between the illegal exploitation of natural resources and the illegal trade in small arms. Moreover  the conflict prevention and resolution strategy should be complemented by measures to combat the financing of terrorists  another major challenge facing the entire international community.  Speaking for a country that has chaired the United Nations Peacebuilding Commission  I am particularly pleased to note the progress in the peace processes in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  Burundi  Côte d’Ivoire  Liberia and Sierra Leone. The inclusion of Guinea-Bissau on the agenda of the Peacebuilding Commission is also very important. In that regard  without false modesty I stress here the role played by Angola  not only in the negotiations that led to the holding of free and fair elections in that country  but also in consolidating peace and political  economic and social stability of that brother country.  The active participation of Angola in resolving the conflicts that have plagued several countries in various regions of Africa has clearly raised the expectations of the entire international community  in particular the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the Chairman of the African Union Commission. Allow me to reaffirm my Government’s commitment to continuing to work within the African Union and the    09-52604 34  United Nations in the search for lasting solutions for peacebuilding and national reconciliation.  It is fitting to refer here to another issue of utmost importance that is a consequence of armed conflict. That is the humanitarian situation — the maintenance and protection of refugee camps and identifying durable solutions for the millions of refugees whose rights must be protected and respected.  The United Nations is unquestionably the principal forum of multilateralism  and its credibility should constantly and increasingly be enhanced by the adoption of effective  creative and practical measures. Thus  the Government of Angola welcomes the new format and functions of the Economic and Social Council  especially the Annual Ministerial Review and the Development Cooperation Forum. Among the reforms that have already taken place  the establishment of the Peacebuilding Commission and of the Human Rights Council should also be highlighted.   My country’s Government  despite welcoming the progress in the evolution and functioning of the United Nations system  cannot help note that the United Nations was created a long time ago — over half a century ago — at a particular time in the international community’s history that we all hope will never reoccur.  The world today is substantially different. The industrial  economic and social development of a large number of countries has narrowed the gap between the most developed countries and the least developed countries. Communications have advanced; technology has progressed; transport is much more sophisticated; and Internet surfing occurs throughout the world. Given this new reality  the Government of Angola believes that the structure of the Organization  which brings together people from around the world  cannot remain indifferent to those developments and should  therefore  adapt to the modern world.  Specifically  the Government of Angola considers that the fact that the reform of the Security Council  particularly aspects related to its composition and the democratization of its decision-making mechanism  has not evolved since 2005 suggests that this is a situation that must be corrected with urgency.  In that context  my Government hopes that the process of ongoing negotiations within the General Assembly will be conclusive.  Furthermore  the Government of Angola attaches great importance to the effort led by the United Nations to implement the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  and disarmament in general  and recognizes that it deserves the utmost attention of all its Members.  Angola also believes that the United Nations should strengthen its monitoring of the implementation of its Programme of Action on Small Arms and develop initiatives to promote the universalization of the Ottawa Convention on Landmines.  At the end of my statement  I would like to avail myself of this golden opportunity to launch an appeal for the lifting of the economic  trade and financial embargo on Cuba. It is fair and imperative to abolish that embargo  because it violates the principles of international law  in particular Articles 1 and 2 of the United Nations Charter.  Angola is fully convinced that the United Nations will not refrain from once again taking a clear and fair position on that embargo  a position that is also consistent with the principles of the Charter.  Finally  I would like to reiterate my conviction that with effort and determination  our Organization will be in a position to correct asymmetries and provide solutions to problems that still exist in the international community in order to build a world that is more fair  stable  and secure and able to provide current and future generations with a standard of living consistent with human dignity."
"3",125,"ALB",64,2009,"I have the special pleasure today to extend to Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki  President of the General Assembly  my congratulations on his excellent work in presiding over the sixty-fourth session of this Assembly. I would also like to thank his predecessor  Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann  for his work in successfully leading the Assembly at its sixty-third session.  I avail myself of this opportunity to extend my greetings to all those present in this Hall today. I also express my deep gratitude to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his high competence and professionalism in leading the United Nations  and acknowledge his important personal contribution to the success of this session.  We are gathered here today after a year in which the world has faced one of the worst financial and economic crises in history. We are gathered here once again at a time when hundreds of millions of people are being oppressed by tyrannical regimes or are facing extreme poverty  disease and major health or social calamities. We are gathered here at a time when brutal conflicts continue to take the lives of innocent people in various regions of our world  and when nuclear crises in Iran and North Korea represent a genuine threat to world peace.  Albania and the Albanian people continue to engage in international cooperation and are determined to offer their modest contribution to advancing peace  freedom and security and respect for human rights  fighting poverty  promoting sustainable development and prosperity and  last but not least  protecting the environment. (spoke in French)  As a European country  Albania remains fully committed and determined to carry out every reform and to take every decision and every other measure required of it on the road to membership of the European Union (EU). More than 94 per cent of Albanians support Albania’s application process for joining the EU. This is not only highly encouraging     09-52592 2  but also a major obligation for my Government to proceed swiftly along this path. This autumn  we expect a positive response from the Council of Ministers of the European Union to our application for candidate status  while we also hope to obtain visa liberalization as soon as possible.  Albania is a new but functioning democracy. About two months ago  we held general parliamentary elections. The international watchdog Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights reported that the elections met the principal standards of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and deserve a generally positive assessment. The newly elected Government has proclaimed the following core pillars of its programmes: building new and modern infrastructure throughout the country; bringing Albania into the digital age; reforming the health-care and education systems; fighting poverty  and creating new jobs for Albanian citizens.  Next year here at the United Nations  we will assess the progress we have made towards fulfilling the Millennium Goals. Albania has put intense effort into achieving significant progress in this area. Over the past three years  some 400 000 Albanians have moved up from below the poverty line  while extreme poverty has been reduced by 70 per cent; tens of thousands of new jobs have been created; the number of university students has doubled and infant mortality has been drastically reduced. (spoke in English)  The years 2008 and 2009 have seen the worst financial and economic crisis the world has known since the Great Depression. The Albanian economy has felt the consequences of the crisis. Its exports fell by 10 per cent and the levels of financial credit were drastically reduced. Despite these consequences  however  Albanian gross domestic product (GDP) grew by more than 5 per cent in the first six months of 2009  our revenues saw an 8 per cent increase compared with those of last year  and foreign direct investment was 59 per cent higher than last year.  I believe that the main factors protecting the Albanian economy in this crisis were  first  the very fact that Albania has the lowest fiscal burden in Europe and that its economy is largely based on liberal standards; secondly  the fact that my Government has invested 10 per cent of the country’s GDP in infrastructure projects in 2009  or  taking into account investment for 2008  20 per cent of GDP over the past two years; thirdly  our thorough reforms aimed at achieving smaller Government  as a result of which Albania now has one of the smallest public administrations per capita in Europe and  indeed  in the entire world; and  last but not least  the very favourable climate for business and investment created by my Government over the past four years. I take this opportunity to invite investors from all countries to consider my country for their projects  which will definitely turn out to be success stories for them  and for Albania.  Albania has maintained excellent cooperation with the United Nations and its agencies. Albania is one of the pilot countries of the Delivering as One initiative  and through its experience and positive results is making a real contribution to this United Nations reform. Delivering as One provides for excellent savings of time and money  as well as much more efficient coordination of the work of United Nations agencies in their cooperation with Member States. This project has had an excellent track record in my country due to the coherence and better coordination of the activities of United Nations bodies with those of our national authorities  particularly with regard to aligning international projects with the country’s priorities.  We have been pleased to see that our reform priorities and national strategy on European integration are in full harmony with the Millennium Development Goals and those of the Delivering as One initiative. The outcome has demonstrated that this project  the philosophy of which depends on the concept of national ownership  has produced more efficient implementation of United Nations development programmes.  Albania is a multireligious society with religious harmony par excellence. In the framework of the Alliance of Civilizations and in accordance with our national strategy on intercultural dialogue  we offer our example of religious harmony and coexistence  one of the most invaluable spiritual heritages of our nation  as a contribution to the aims of this United Nations initiative.  This general debate was preceded by the Summit on Climate Change. It gives me great pleasure to inform the Assembly that more than 90 per cent of the electricity my country consumes comes from   3 09-52592  renewable hydroelectric power. Although we are open to other energy sources  including nuclear  we are working hard and have so far secured about €5 billion in new investment for new hydroelectric  wind and biomass energy plants. Albania intends to become a small super-Power of green energy in the region.  The last decade of brutal conflict in the Balkans seems to have been consigned to the annals of history. The countries of that region are now engaged in a process of cooperation in all fields and in European and Euro-Atlantic integration. This year  Albania and Croatia became full members of NATO. Other countries of the region have made significant progress towards EU and NATO membership.  I must stress at this point that  although only a short time has passed since Kosovo’s declaration of independence  the establishment of the independent state of Kosovo has become an important factor for peace and stability in South-East Europe. In that country  which declared independence 20 months ago  inter-ethnic relations have improved and inter-ethnic tensions have been significantly reduced. Serbs are no longer leaving Kosovo. The opposite is happening — many Serbian families are coming back to Kosovo to build their future in their country. My Government is determined to help and assist the Government of Kosovo in its projects to facilitate the return of the displaced people of that country.  The European Union has deployed its Rule of Law Mission  which is doing an excellent job and providing extremely valuable help to the Government of Kosovo and its authorities in consolidating the rule of law and functional democracy in Kosovo  as well as in developing the highest European standards for the coexistence of the various ethnic communities. The International Security Force in Kosovo has also played a very positive role  and the very fact that its strength has been reduced is clear evidence of the stability in that country.  Meanwhile  63 States Members of the United Nations have recognized independent Kosovo  and the Republic of Kosovo has become a member of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Nevertheless  Kosovo has not yet assumed the place that it deserves in the family of sovereign countries of this prestigious Organization.   On this occasion  I would like to point out that all the countries that recognize the Republic of Kosovo and the international institutions that have accepted it in their forums as an independent member State have done so because  above all else  they are convinced that the independence of Kosovo and its international recognition make a major contribution to peace and stability in South-East Europe. That is why I take this opportunity to express my deepest gratitude to all Governments and States Members of the United Nations that are considering a review and assessment of the existing reality in South-East Europe and the possibility of recognizing the independence of Kosovo. In my judgment  that would be a great contribution to peace  stability  security and cooperation in our region.  Fourteen years ago  after condemning the coercive oppression  violence and barbarism of the Milosevic regime against Albanians in Kosovo  137 States Members of the United Nations voted in resolution 49/204 of 23 December 1994 to recognize and respect the will of the inhabitants of Kosovo. Today  that will has become the reality of an independent Kosovo and has been recognized by 63 countries that took that historic vote. I hope and firmly believe that the rest of the countries that voted for that historic resolution will reaffirm the will that they expressed 14 years ago — this time through their recognition of Europe’s newest State  the Republic of Kosovo.  With its foreign policy of peace and good relations with all countries  its modest but important contribution to international missions of peace and human rights protection through its policy of good neighbourliness  and a moderate and constructive role in the region  Albania has become a producer of and a direct contributor to stability and security in the region and at the global level.  Today  Albania participates in peacekeeping missions in several international operations in the framework of the United Nations and other regional security organizations  such as in Afghanistan  Bosnia  Iraq  Chad and other countries. Only about two months ago  Albania doubled its number of troops in the International Security Assistance Force mission. My country acknowledges and supports every effort for global peace and security  and will continue to support all efforts of the United Nations  NATO and other actors that promote peace  stability and security in the world and that keep in check those two countries that threaten it — Iran and North Korea — with their very dangerous nuclear programmes.    09-52592 4   All States Members of the United Nations share the responsibility for the efficient functioning of this Organization. No one can ignore the track record of the United Nations activities in many fields. Whenever there is a crisis  poverty  famine  disease or disaster  the United Nations is there to provide relief and support.   However  it has long been evident that the world  countries and the complexity of international relations develop much faster than the United Nations is able to adjust and adapt itself to the new realities. That is why Albania strongly supports the continuation of the reform process of this Organization and the further improvement of the United Nations system. A more efficient decision-making mechanism is pivotal in that respect. We support the efforts to reform the Security Council. We believe that in order to meet the challenges of the twenty-first century  we need a Security Council that is efficient  transparent and legitimate in its decision-making process and in which regions and individual Member States are adequately represented."
"4",148,"AND",64,2009,"I must first apologize for the absence of our head of Government  Mr. Jaume Bartumeu Cassany  who  due to his institutional agenda  is unable to attend the general debate.  It is a great honour for the Principality of Andorra and the Government that I represent to speak in the General Assembly Hall. We Andorrans are well aware of the significance of being a small State within the United Nations. We are not trying to make our mark on international politics  but we want to make clear our intention to respect and defend international law  standards of good-neighbourly relations and the principle of solidarity between peoples.  Europe is our natural frame of reference. We wish to be recognized in that way  not only in terms of cultural and historical affinity  but also in the legal and economic fields. In brief  our conception of solidarity  both domestic and international  and our notion of international relations are the same as those of the rest of Europe.  Since 1993  we have had a constitutional framework that allows us to translate all those principles into practice and to make them a reality. Supported by that constitutional framework  on 10 August we presented a law for the exchange of information on fiscal matters  which  once debated and amended  was approved by the parliament on 7 September.  We have always been certain of Andorra’s loyalty to the international community. Yet we thought it appropriate to dispel any doubts and to follow the recommendations of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and other international institutions  as expressed in meetings of the Group of 20.  That is the first example  but others will follow  because our Government’s priority is to dispel any doubts about our determination to adapt to the demands and expectations of our European neighbours and the   49 09-52592  rest of the international community. We are convinced that this and other steps will be appreciated and understood by all international stakeholders that may at any time have harboured doubts about our community spirit towards the rest of the world. We are also confident that this new era will enable us to interact more with Europe and other continents by strengthening our international bonds and our economic and human presence.  In line with that legislation  our country has already been in contact  and even signed agreements  with some European countries. In the future  we will do likewise with other countries  including the United States of America  Australia and Argentina. Needless to say  our priority has been to negotiate with France  Spain and Portugal  which are our closest neighbours.  Incidentally  I would add that Andorra has suffered from a lingering structural crisis for at least the past four years. This has now been exacerbated by the world economic crisis. The world cannot solve our particular crisis for us. We must do it for ourselves. To concentrate on the idea that interests us  I assure the General Assembly that our Government’s action focuses on clearly demonstrating to the international community that we are fulfilling our duties. We very much wish to cooperate  promote international ties and instil confidence.  The exchange of tax information will undoubtedly result in the signing of double-taxation agreements. As a result  we will boost our relations with countries with which previous links were somewhat weak. Indeed  is that not one of the founding objectives of the United Nations?  The legislation to which I have referred addresses issues that have been at the heart of OECD discussions for the past few months. It will affect requests for information launched after the entry into force of tax-information exchange agreements or double-taxation agreements.  Let us be clear  tax havens and fiscal opacity  which have been identified and condemned as two of the major financial evils of the twentieth century  are matters that all Andorrans would like to overcome soon. Our strategic position is clear  and our commitment is strong.  At the same time  we are proposing a tax reform that will allocate resources according to priorities that serve the general interest and provide guarantees to Europe and to the rest of the world that we want clear  transparent and accountable relations. That reform will offer entrepreneurs and professionals an opportunity to export goods and services from Andorra on an equal footing. Only then will international companies seriously consider the possibility of investing in Andorra within a stable juridical environment.  I sincerely hope that there will be no doubts about my Government’s desire to face the economic issues that have been at the heart of international debates over the past few months. The need to move forward towards greater financial transparency in Andorra leads us to expect the same standards from the international community. We have understood and noted that the system that governed the world economy in the twentieth century has become obsolete.  International organizations and every political  economic and social institution must make efforts to guarantee transparency. We believe that reform of the international economic system should be immediate  rigorous and credible. It should be led by the United Nations  in close cooperation with the World Bank  the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organization.  However  in order to face that and other challenges  we need to modernize the Organization  revitalize the General Assembly and reform the Security Council. In our opinion  those objectives  along with so-called system-wide coherence  must include the right to gender equality.  We in Andorra thus understand that we need fair  clear and internationally recognized standards and regulations to instil confidence in Andorran entrepreneurs and employees alike. But we should also consider the demands of the international financial situation and the need to promote transparency and regulatory mechanisms for financial activities.  Solving the international financial crisis is one of our main priorities. There should be no doubt about that. However  we need to tackle other issues affecting the international community. I am referring to climate change. As has already been mentioned in the Assembly Hall  this is one of the most serious challenges humankind has ever faced.  We in the Principality of Andorra recognize the efforts of the United Nations to try to mobilize the international community. As French head of State and    09-52592 50  Co-Prince of Andorra Nicolas Sarkozy reminded us here (see )  it is time that each State make a strong commitment to solving this issue. Andorra’s commitment to combating the effects of climate change is real. Progress can already be seen in such efforts as our ratification of the Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer.  We hope that at Copenhagen in December it will be possible to adopt a new climate agreement that is equitable  efficient and ambitious from a scientific point of view. We believe that  to achieve a positive result at the Conference  it is essential to involve all society  especially younger generations.  We believe health to be a fundamental right that is necessary to achieve sustainable development in Europe and throughout the world. We face new challenges in the health sector. The new influenza virus is one such challenge. The Andorran Government has decided to fight it by making vaccination available to the majority of our population. That decision was taken in cooperation with our neighbours and the World Health Organization. On another matter  the Principalities of Monaco and Andorra have joined forces to finance a four-year project to reduce the vulnerability of women of reproductive age stemming from the food crisis affecting Madagascar. Those are two examples of fruitful and successful cooperation between international actors.  The responsibility to protect populations against genocide  war crimes  ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity serves to remind us once again of the need for responsible cooperation. Neither world Powers nor mid-sized and small countries can abandon cooperation. We all are necessary  because we all are inhabitants of the Earth."
"5",193,"ARE",64,2009,"Since the last session of the General Assembly  we have witnessed various actions and developments that have left their negative impact on international joint efforts to address the threats and challenges that still face our world  particularly in the areas of security  stability and sustainable development.  Among the most notable implications of those challenges  whose consequences transcend national borders  are the international financial crisis  deterioration of the environment  the increase in unemployment and poverty  the outbreaks of infectious diseases  lack of security and stability in a number of countries  and the stalemate in the Middle East peace process.  The United Arab Emirates would like to seize this opportunity to express its pride that the international community has selected Masdar City in Abu Dhabi as a seat for the International Renewable Energy Agency. In that context  we renew our commitment and readiness to cooperate fully in providing all facilities and technical resources required for the success of this international agency.  We wish to stress that the United Arab Emirates’ interest in developing a programme for the peaceful uses of nuclear energy stems from its desire to meet its growing energy needs in the future. By developing a peaceful nuclear energy model that complies with the highest standards of operational transparency while fulfilling the highest requirements of nuclear safety and security and non-proliferation  in cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency and other responsible and experienced States  the United Arab Emirates hopes that a new course will be charted for the safe and beneficial use of nuclear energy.  The United Arab Emirates’ commitment not to enrich uranium and reprocess fuels locally is among the most salient features of this model  which is one supported by enhanced international transparency and cooperation mechanisms.  The United Arab Emirates renews in this forum its disappointment at the continued occupation by the Islamic Republic of Iran of the three United Arab Emirates islands: Greater Tunb  Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa since 1971. The United Arab Emirates demands the return of those islands under conditions of full sovereignty  including their regional waters  airspace  continental shelf and their exclusive economic zone as integral parts of the national sovereignty of the United Arab Emirates.  The United Arab Emirates also affirms that all military and administrative measures taken by the Iranian Government on those islands are null and void and have no legal effect  regardless of how long the occupation might last. In that context  we call upon the international community to urge Iran to respond to the peaceful and sincere initiatives of the United Arab Emirates. These initiatives were supported and adopted by the Gulf Cooperation Council and the League of Arab States  and they call for a just settlement of that issue.  This could be done either through direct and serious negotiations between the two countries or by referring the issue to the International Court of Justice  in accordance with the United Nations Charter and the provisions of international law.  We also hope that the Iranian Government will respond positively and fairly to this sensitive and important issue. Such action would strengthen good-neighbourly relations and create a base for confidence-building measures in the Arab Gulf region.    09-52592 24   We note with satisfaction the gradual withdrawal of foreign troops from Iraq and the extension of the national authority of its Government over all its territory. In this context  we reaffirm our long-standing support to the people and the Government of Iraq. In particular  we support their efforts to expedite the rebuilding of their security  legislative and economic institutions as well as their efforts to achieve national reconciliation.   However  we are also deeply concerned at the deteriorating security and humanitarian situation in Iraq  and we strongly condemn the recent terrorist bombings in that brotherly country. In that context  we call for respect for the territorial integrity  sovereignty and independence of Iraq and non-intervention in its internal affairs. Its Arab and Islamic identity must be upheld; we condemn all attempts to divide or dismember the Iraqi State.  The United Arab Emirates expresses its disappointment at the state of the peace process in the Middle East  which has deteriorated owing to continuing Israeli aggression against and occupation of Palestinian and Arab territories. This includes the harsh blockade imposed on the Palestinian people  in particular in Gaza  the ongoing confiscation of land  property and homes of the Palestinian people  and the building of more settlements and the separation wall in the occupied territories. That is all carried out with a view to Judaizing occupied East Jerusalem and changing its Arab identity in flagrant violation of international law and resolutions of international legitimacy.  The United Arab Emirates welcomed the positive positions expressed by United States President Barack Obama in this Hall on 23 September. We believe that his address (see ) set out a firm basis for negotiations between the Palestinians and the Israeli Government. We hope that Mr. Obama will continue to closely pursue that important issue.  We also welcome the cautious positions stated by the European Union  the other members of the Quartet and the international community regarding the Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories. However  we believe that those positions are not sufficient. More effective efforts are needed in order to resume serious negotiations with the Palestinian Authority.  In that context  we emphasize that the achievement of a just  lasting and comprehensive peace in the Middle East requires an end to the Israeli occupation of all occupied Arab and Palestinian territories and the establishment of an independent Palestinian State  with Al-Quds as its capital  based on the principle of land for peace and in accordance with the Arab Peace Initiative and resolutions of international legitimacy.  The United Arab Emirates will continue to stand by the Palestinian National Authority and the Palestinian people and to support their just cause. In that context  we commend His Excellency President Mahmoud Abbas for his tireless efforts to restore the legitimate rights of his people  to establish a Palestinian State with Al-Quds as its capital and to achieve development and peace there. The United Arab Emirates also supports all ongoing efforts  particularly those undertaken by the sisterly Arab Republic of Egypt  with a view to achieving national reconciliation in Palestine.  The United Arab Emirates attaches particular importance to African countries. It is strengthening its cooperation and partnerships with those countries in line with the United Nations Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2)  with special focus on goals to combat poverty and to ensure that Africa  which represents the largest part of the South  receives a fair and equitable share of global prosperity. The United Arab Emirates reiterates its decades-long energy policy  which is based on maintaining the volume and flow of its energy supplies without restriction or political or non-political impediment.  Furthermore  the United Arab Emirates has long and consistently been pursuing a foreign policy based on the principles and purposes of the United Nations  in particular with regard to the settlement of international disputes by peaceful means  non-intervention in the internal affairs of States and the protection of national sovereignty. In that context  we affirm our continued commitment to the one-China policy.  The United Arab Emirates  as an active member of the international community  is always ready to reiterate its commitment to respecting the principles of human rights in the light of its human values and national principles and in line with the provisions and machinery of relevant international conventions. The   25 09-52592  universal periodic review on the United Arab Emirates was adopted by the Human Rights Council in Geneva last December.  The United Arab Emirates attaches great importance to the conditions of migrant workers and the protection of their full rights  in accordance with the constitution of the United Arab Emirates  national legislation and the standards of the International Labour Organization. My Government has recently adopted a set of policies and measures aimed at enhancing many aspects of labour protection. It has taken steps to intensify regional cooperation among labour-exporting and labour-importing countries in Asia with what is known as the Abu Dhabi Dialogue  which aims to promote the protection of workers at all stages of contractual labour. Also  the United Arab Emirates actively participates in the International Forum on Migration and Development and supports its activities and research work. The forum was initiated by the High-level Dialogue on International Migration and Development  held on the sidelines of the General Assembly in the autumn of 2006.  Women and children occupy an important place among the national priorities of the United Arab Emirates Government  in particular with regard to education  health  knowledge and human development. The empowerment of women and the care and protection of children are among the major success stories of our national development project. The United Arab Emirates has also made efforts to combat all forms of violence  extremism  crime  violation of human rights and human trafficking through partnerships that are based on equality and mutual respect and contribute to achieving peace  stability and sustainable development.  In conclusion  we hope that our deliberations on the items on the Assembly’s agenda this session will lead to positive results that will enhance our joint efforts to establish a more just  peaceful  tolerant and developed world.

"6",240,"ARG",64,2009,"I must confess that  when I arrived in this city to participate in this session of the General Assembly  I had intended to begin my statement with a strong appeal on the need to rebuild multilateralism and cooperation as the two basic instruments to overcome what today is undoubtedly the central issue in our global discussion  namely  overcoming the social and economic crisis. However  certain events on Monday and Tuesday oblige me to begin my statement by reporting that the Embassy of the Argentine Republic in Tegucigalpa  Republic of Honduras  had its electricity cut off some two days ago. That  of course  was not because we had not paid the bill  but was for far more serious reasons.   Next to the Argentine Embassy is a television studio which broadcast the news of President Zelaya’s arrival in Honduras  the repression and the demonstrations in favour of the return of democracy. That was one of the reasons. In any event  we have had better luck than the Embassy of the sister Republic of Brazil  where  at an early stage they cut off not only the electricity but the water as well — for having given shelter to the constitutional President  Manuel Zelaya.  As a Latin American  I must recall that not even in Chile during the dictatorship of General Pinochet  or in Argentina during the dictatorship of General Jorge Rafael Videla — perhaps the two cruelest dictatorships in Latin America — was there similar behaviour against embassies that were actively working to give shelter to refugees.  I say this because it is crucial that we realize that we must design and forge a multilateral strategy which is strong and specific to return democracy to Honduras. We need a strategy which would actually allow for true respect for human rights and ensure free and democratic elections — which can take place only with full respect for the constitution. If we do not do this  we would be setting a harsh precedent in a region where  for decades during the national security doctrine  suspensions of democracy claimed the lives of thousands and thousands of Latin Americans  led to the exile of many other and created the region’s most serious economic and social tragedy in memory.    09-52228 2   I make this appeal because I played an active role from the platform of the Organization of American States  and also accompanied the former President of the General Assembly  Father Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann  to El Salvador in order to carry out a task which would safeguard two basic values which  in my opinion  our region has managed to develop: democracy and respect for human rights.  Therefore  I believe that multilateralism would also mean understanding that we have to set common and general rules in this globalized world that must be accepted by all countries. In this case  we are faced with a cynical media coup which was carefully hidden or minimized because  in fact  it was slanted against the advent of populist progressive Governments in the region. I believe that  for all of us  defining multilateralism is going to require specific actions and rules so that absolutely all of us will have the same parameters when it comes time to judge conduct  attitudes and institutional situations.  Yesterday I took part in the climate change event convened by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in order to bring positions closer together with a view to the Copenhagen Conference  which will take place in a little more than 10 weeks’ time. A decade and a half ago we agreed on the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  dealing with environmental protection  and we later adopted the Kyoto Protocol in order to begin ensuring respect for those obligations undertaken by nations. A decade and a half later  it is clear that neither agreement is being satisfactorily implemented.  Essentially  this is sometimes because the nations most responsible for pollution and gas emissions  which should bear greater responsibility for reducing those emissions  in terms of investments both in their own countries and in developing countries  cannot come to an agreement either. As I was saying yesterday in our meeting  I think we need to understand that the only possibility of successfully approaching globalization lies precisely in the setting of common rules which would be respected by all nations  developed and developing.  In this framework  we should mention the situation of the Argentine Republic  where we still have a colonial enclave  our Malvinas Islands  which persists without the possibility of addressing the question of sovereignty together with the United Kingdom  as proclaimed in many General Assembly resolutions. We were recently able to agree  following a humanitarian request  that family members with loved ones buried on the islands should be able to travel there by air to inaugurate a cenotaph to pay tribute to those who fought for their homeland.  All of this points to the very clear need to look at multilateralism not only as a type of rhetorical statement repeated every year in this or other multilateral forums  but rather in terms of concrete results. Otherwise  it will become increasingly complicated  with ever more unresolved problems. For  in the final analysis  the multilateralism we have been persistently proclaiming since 2003 has not been put into practice.  My country and the United States are the only two countries to have experienced attacks of international terrorism. For Argentina  the first was in 1992  at the Embassy of Israel  and the second was at the Asociación Mutual Israelita Argentina (AMIA). Hundreds of people died in those attacks. Today  in this Assembly  I am joined by the head of AMIA  the entity that was bombed  as well as by family members who have accompanied him.  In 2007  then-President Néstor Kirchner came here to the Assembly (see A/62/PV.5) to call on the Islamic Republic of Iran to agree to extradite officials of its country wanted by the Argentine justice system in order to carry out a proper investigation and assign responsibility for that serious attack. Last year  I myself came here (see A/63/PV.5) to call once again on the authorities of the Islamic Republic of Iran to accede to our request. I said that there were constitutional guarantees in my country; that the principle that no one is guilty until proven guilty beyond a shadow of a doubt prevails from one end of my country to the other; and that we have guarantees for freedom and the administration of justice. Nevertheless  that did not happen. Instead  this year  one of the officials whose extradition was sought by the prosecutor on the case was promoted to minister.   I know that some 4  5 or 15 speakers from now the President of the Islamic Republic of Iran will take the floor. Surely  he will once again deny tragedies that occurred in the course of western history in the twentieth century. He will surely invoke the threat of other imperialisms. And he will also surely invoke God. I would like to say to him that my country  the   3 09-52228  Argentine Republic  is not an imperialist country — neither by way of belief nor as a reflection of our history. To the contrary  ours is a country that suffered from colonial oppression at its founding. During the world’s bipolar era  we also suffered from the doctrine of national security. I would like to tell him that  like him  I believe in God. We may do so in different faiths but  in the end  I believe that neither of us believes that God could command us to prefer threats or to avoid justice from being done.  As President of the Argentine Republic  therefore  I humbly reiterate once again our appeal for the extradition of the officials whom Argentina’s justice system believes are responsible — not to be found guilty  but to be judged and to be allowed to take advantage of all the rights and guarantees that every Argentine citizen and foreigner has in our country: guarantees under democracy  whose unconditional defence Argentina has made part of its institutional and historical core.  I would not wish to conclude without referring to three events that I believe are very positive  which I would like to share with the members of the Assembly today. The first took place quite recently  on 9 September  when the Argentine Republic received a visit from the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights  including its Chair and the President of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights. That visit occurred 30 years after the Court’s first visit  during the dictatorship  when it came to investigate the crimes that were being committed and to take complaints from Argentine citizens — including our Minister for Foreign Affairs  who is with me today and who  like his father  was imprisoned at that time — and to hear testimony about the serious violations that were taking place.  Thirty years later  the men who comprised the Commission and the men and women who are its members today visited an Argentina where criminals responsible for genocide under the dictatorship are being tried by judges in accordance with the Constitution. We have also reached an agreement with the Inter-American Court to send a bill to our legislature — which I have already done — to eliminate the crime of libel and defamation against journalists. That is homage to the freedom of expression and of the press. But I also firmly believe that it should apply to all citizens. It is offensive that  in the twenty-first century  someone could be sentenced to prison for having said something and said it freely.  We have also reached an agreement to send up two bills — which we have also already done — to contribute to the recovery of children born in captivity during the dictatorship. Those will include provisions to ensure respect for the victims  as well as on society’s collective right to learn their identities.  The second thing that I would like to share has to do with the fact that I listened today to the President of the United States speak about an issue that is crucial to world peace and security  as well as to the rights of the Palestinian people. It is also a key component of a strategy against international terrorism  which  as ever  we continue to condemn. It is genuinely satisfying  and a salve to the soul  to hear from the mouth of the President of the United States of America that there is a need for the Palestinian people to be able to live on their land free of settlements of any kind  as well as  clearly  a right for Israel’s citizens to live in peace within their borders. The words of the President and the timely message he delivered at Cairo University  which many here likely followed with interest  place us in a position that we have not occupied for many years  namely  the possibility of beginning negotiations — successful ones  I hope — between the Palestinian Authority and the Government of Israel to at last resolve a key issue for international peace and security  namely  the Palestinian question.  Lastly  I would like to tell the Assembly that  as a member of the Group of 20 (G-20)  which will meet tomorrow in Pittsburgh  we would like to call for the presence of another multilateral body to be heard from at those meetings: the International Labour Organization. In the two previous G-20 meetings  there was a great deal of discussion about the financial crisis. However  as we did then  we continue to believe that a key issue is to once again discuss the real economy. That is why we believed it timely that workers and business owners  as genuine actors in the real economy and as catalysts to re-energizing it  should be heard from as well in those forums  alongside officials from multilateral credit institutions and the World Bank.  We are genuinely convinced that there is a need to build a new multilateralism in which all of us are genuinely on an equal footing; where rights and obligations and the road map for the course to be taken    09-52228 4  are the same for rich and poor countries alike; and where the rights and responsibilities of developing countries are the same as those of developed States. We therefore agreed that equal rules of the game for the entire world was one of the basic elements of ensuring success in building multilateralism. If we do not achieve this  we will continue with these rhetorical exercises year after year  but we will never achieve the results that are not a right but an obligation for all of us who make up this body.  In conclusion  democracy  the defence of human rights  and equal rules for all countries in the world are the three key elements to building a new multilateralism. These three requirements must be equal and the same for all countries  but above all for those that  through their own actions and because of their level of social and economic development  lead the major developed countries of the world.   It is clear that those who have the greatest responsibility and hold the greatest leadership roles — won through military  technological  economic and even cultural power — also have an obligation to exercise that leadership in a responsible manner. This is what we  the developing and emerging countries  feel  and what we ask of the major nations of the world. They have the responsibility to build this world. This will no doubt be echoed in all our speeches  but this building must be done every day through our decisions and concrete actions. "
"7",265,"ARM",64,2009,"I should like to warmly congratulate Mr. Treki on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. We express our readiness to work with him to achieve the ambitious agenda ahead of us during this session. I should also like to extend our thanks to outgoing President Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann for his hard work during the previous session.  Each new session of the General Assembly provides an opportunity for us to share our achievements and concerns with each other  and to join our efforts in moving the global agenda forward. We are going through a truly challenging period. In the past year  we were all devastated by the impact of the financial crisis. The crisis left no corner of the world and no economic sector untouched. Many countries experienced unprecedented economic decline  which seriously challenged their hard-earned advances and prospects for attaining the Millennium Development Goals by 2015. Armenia was not spared the dramatic effects of the ongoing financial crisis. However  the Armenian Government has done best to safeguard the socially vulnerable. No budget cuts have been made in the social sector.  We believe that our endeavours must be guided first and foremost by the need to mitigate the human costs of the crisis in order to avoid serious consequences for human security. We believe that an equitable global recovery requires the full participation of all countries  irrespective of their size and level of development  in shaping appropriate responses to the crisis. And we have to come together here  in this universal body  to take decisions that will help us overcome the past and build for the future  because there are still painful gaps separating the dreams of our people and their prospects.  In accordance with their respective mandates  the United Nations funds  programmes and agencies have an important role to play in advancing development in accordance with national strategies and priorities  and in assisting countries in achieving the internationally agreed Millennium Development Goals. We understand that achieving these goals  the deadline for which is 2015  will require enormous efforts. The General Assembly will continue to address this issue during its sixty-fourth session  and Armenia is ready to contribute to the preparatory process for a high-level meeting on this topic in September 2010.  We have embarked on the process of United Nations reform in order to ensure that this forum can   13 09-52604  better reflect present-day realities and to enhance its capabilities and effectiveness in addressing modern challenges. Armenia commits itself to strengthening the institutional capacities of the United Nations  supports the process of United Nations reform and is ready to make its contribution.  We have successfully agreed on several vital decisions  including the creation of the Peacebuilding Commission and the Human Rights Council. We aspire to further advance the protection of human rights  in conformity with the obligations of Member States  and we see honest discussion within the Human Rights Council on outstanding issues and the sharing of experiences on how to overcome them as the true path to success in this respect.  We regard the prevention of genocide and the responsibility to protect as the key principles and cornerstones of the overall human security system. In this respect  we commend the report of the Secretary-General on implementing the responsibility to protect (A/63/677)  which charts a course for the United Nations to prevent genocide  war crimes and ethnic cleansing by bolstering the capacities of the Organization.   As is rightly stated in the report  genocide does not happen all of a sudden. The instigators propagate intolerance and hatred  preparing the ground for violence. As survivors of genocide  we Armenians welcome all efforts to prevent and combat racist and xenophobic attitudes. We have done and will continue to do all we can to provide for continuous advocacy in favour of the prevention of genocide. The international community must be vigilant to the development of such situations and events  and demonstrate its ability to act in a timely fashion to prevent future tragedies.  We consider achieving the goals of disarmament and non-proliferation to be major elements of global and regional security systems. We must shoulder our responsibilities and work towards not only non-proliferation and the elimination of nuclear weapons  but also the elimination of the militaristic aspirations of some States. It is totally unacceptable that threats to resolve disputes by military means are made at the highest level  and that they are left unchallenged by the international community.  The Nagorny Karabakh peace process  which is mediated by the co-chairs of the Minsk Group of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)  is moving forward. The Presidents and Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Armenia and Azerbaijan meet regularly to discuss the principles of a comprehensive resolution of the conflict. Armenia is convinced that  in order to create an opportunity for progress in the peaceful settlement of the Nagorny Karabakh conflict  the parties should commit to refraining from taking steps that could hamper dialogue and the peace process.   Azerbaijan consistently misrepresents the essence of the Nagorny Karabakh problem in the international arena  as it did two days ago in this forum  trying to downplay ethnic cleansing and its policy of violence against the people of Nagorny Karabakh. The international community will recall Azerbaijan’s open aggression  large-scale hostilities and war against Nagorny Karabakh  in which it was also aided by mercenaries closely linked to terrorist organizations. These events ultimately claimed lives of tens of thousands of civilians.  We believe that there is a serious basis for the settlement of the Nagorny Karabakh problem if the provisions contained in the declaration signed by the Presidents of Armenia  Azerbaijan and Russia in November 2008; the declaration of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the co-chair countries of the OSCE Minsk Group; and the declaration adopted by the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of all 56 OSCE member States in Helsinki in December  are met. Pursuant to these documents  the parties must commit themselves to the peaceful settlement of the problem through negotiations based on the Madrid principles of the co-chairs of the OSCE Minsk Group.  The basic principles around which negotiations are currently being held are anchored in benchmark codes of international law as incorporated in the Charter of this Organization  the Helsinki Final Act and other relevant international documents. The international principles of the non-use and non-threat of use of force  of the self-determination of peoples and of territorial integrity are equally viable.   Some have long attempted to downplay the importance of the notion of the self-determination of peoples as a second-rate principle in the system of international law and as inferior to that of territorial integrity. I have to disappoint the advocates of double standards. The right to self-determination is an unconditional clause of international law; it is a    09-52604 14  principle of liberty and of the freedom of any people to choose its future and fate  and to defend its collective rights whenever those rights and that future are jeopardized. If self-determination were a principle inferior to territorial integrity  there would have been only 52 Member States of the United Nations  instead of the current 192.  Trust and accountability among neighbouring States are guarantees of sustainable cooperation and durable security in any region. We in the South Caucasus have yet to witness that. Our region  in fact  is among the most sensitive hot spots on the world’s political map  overloaded with a plethora of security threats and challenges. The region is devastated by conflicts and inter-State tensions  dividing lines and economic blockades. Closed borders and ruptured ties have become the norm of life.   However  a courageous act and a courageous response hold the promise of changing the situation for the better. The process of the normalization of Armenian-Turkish relations was begun in September by the President of Armenia  Serzh Sargsyan. That initiative on his part — known as football diplomacy — promises to bear fruit despite all difficulties. Over the past year  with the help of our Swiss mediators and other international partners  we have made progress towards opening our shared border  one of the last closed borders in Europe  and the normalization of our relations with no preconditions. We trust that the necessary political will shall finally overcome the mentality of the past and that the wisdom and courage necessary to taking the last decisive steps will prevail.   We have been most encouraged by the support of the international community. We are well aware of the fundamental and positive implications of the normalization of Armenian-Turkish relations and of the opening of the border for the security and stability of the region.  We must reinforce the bridges between United Nations Member States  working out mutually beneficial and comprehensive security and cooperation plans. Our common objective should be the shaping of an environment that is safe and prosperous for all. To meet the political  economic  environmental and social challenges  we have to jointly muster our efforts  resources and political determination. Only together can we successfully confront these challenges and push forward the international development agenda."
"8",298,"ATG",64,2009,"On behalf of my Government and the people of Antigua and Barbuda  I congratulate you  Sir  on your election to preside over the sixty-fourth session of the General Assembly and wish you every success during your tenure. I also extend heartfelt congratulations to Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann on his visionary and inspiring leadership over the past year.   “We are all members of one body. The welfare of the weakest and the welfare of the most powerful are inseparably bound together. Industry cannot flourish if labour languish. Transportation cannot prosper if manufactures decline. The general welfare cannot be provided for in any one act  but it is well to remember that the benefit of one is the benefit of all  and the neglect of one is the neglect of all.”  Those words are taken from a 1914 speech by Calvin Coolidge. However  as we gather as a community of nations almost a century later  they are just as timely. Our common humanity is being tested by the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. Additional challenges that currently confront us include the increased incidence and impact of pandemic diseases  worsening poverty and hunger that trap millions around the globe  the adverse consequences of climate change  tensions over peace and security  and increasing environmental degradation. When history is recorded  our success as leaders will be determined by our stewardship during these turbulent times.  Years ago in much warmer and gentler climes  small island nations like our twin island nation of Antigua and Barbuda convened a global conference entitled “Small Islands  Big Issues”. Today  we remain small islands  but the issues with which we grapple are gargantuan. In many cases  they have been exacerbated by ill-conceived or ineffective interventions and structures. None among us is immune to the financial insecurity brought about by global banking mismanagement and fraud. At the same time  global climate change threatens to overwhelm the very fabric of our small nations.  It has been said that the rising tide of globalization floats all boats on a sea of economic opportunities. What is now clear is that such tides can turn into an economic tsunami that  in one swift wave  can wash away development gains that took decades to be realized. That is the situation in which Antigua and Barbuda now finds itself. An unwelcome visitor in the form of this global economic crisis has thrust itself upon our pristine shores and is threatening to wreak untold damage on our economies.   Thus  while some members of our community of nations have begun to tout faint but hopeful signs of recovery  prudence dictates that we pay heed to the words of Calvin Coolidge and acknowledge that it simply is not an option to adopt an insular approach in responding to this global crisis. The stronger   33 09-52463  economies must remain ever cognizant of the fact that the welfare of the weakest and the welfare of the most powerful are inseparably bound together.  In responding to the crisis  all parties must admit that the old methodologies  as reflected in the Washington Consensus and similar models  are obsolete. As we actively pursue the creation of new structures and strategies  Antigua and Barbuda encourages the community of nations to explore alternative models  such as that represented by the Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas (ALBA). With its foundation principles of complementarity as an alternative to competition  solidarity as opposed to domination  cooperation as a replacement for exploitation  and respect for sovereignty rather than corporate rule  ALBA represents an innovative and viable model of integration and development.  Antigua and Barbuda  along with many of our Caribbean Community (CARICOM) brothers and sisters  welcomes the paradigm shift that now characterizes engagement with agencies such as the International Monetary Fund. The decision to limit conditionalities to those critical to achieving the objectives of the country programme being supported  and the commitment to play a more supportive role and allow the objectives to be set by the borrowing country are welcome responses to earlier calls to recognize the absolute necessity of using factors other than per capita gross domestic product as a criteria to access concessionary financing. We maintain that therein lies the key to mitigating a downward spiral into economic and social chaos.  Decision-making on issues of international financial governance remains a privilege of the few when such decisions have great impact on the lives  livelihood and basic well-being of millions of people the world over. My Government calls on the developed countries that are members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to ensure that their response strategies involve better international cooperation on tax issues through inclusive and cooperative frameworks that ensure the involvement and equal treatment of small jurisdictions  as stipulated in the Outcome Document (resolution 63/303) of the United Nations Conference on the World Financial and Economic Crisis and Its Impact on Development. The Outcome Document is a welcome one  and I applaud the President of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session for giving voice to the G-192  including the developing and most vulnerable countries.   The genesis of the crisis lies in the capitals of the developed world  but its effects are global and the response must be truly global. In this regard  I urge the Assembly  through the ad hoc working group to follow up on the outcome of the Conference  to take an inclusive approach to allow for the participation of those that are not members of the exclusive Group of Eight and Group of Twenty clubs.   Again  drawing on the words of Coolidge  I point out that the general welfare cannot be provided for in any one act or  I would add  by any single  small subset of the community of nations seeking unilaterally to reshape the global economic and financial architecture. It is in our power to change the operating principles of global capitalism such that economic prosperity is shared equally among countries and within countries. Drastic change is needed  in theory and practice  in economic assumptions and in the institutions of governance. It is the sustainable path to development and a challenge to which this assembly of nations and leaders must rise.  Meeting transnational and global threats and challenges to development requires international cooperation. As previously stated  traditional Western-based modalities of development cooperation in which partners are not considered equals have failed us. A paradigm shift is not an option; it is an imperative. My Government firmly believes in promoting partnerships in support of sustainable development based on principles of mutual respect and understanding  equality and a genuine desire to effect the social and economic development of all.   I have already alluded to my country’s membership in ALBA and commended that innovative model of integration and development. Antigua and Barbuda also looks forward to fully playing its role in ensuring that the various trade arrangements entered into with the European Union  the United States of America and Canada work in the interest of all our nations. My Government  however  will continue to place a strong emphasis on the development components  which should be central to ensuring that these arrangements produce positive results for our people.   At the same time  we have deepened our integration efforts with our CARICOM brothers and    09-52463 34  sisters  focusing on fully implementing the CARICOM Single Market and Economy as well as deepening the various subregional regulatory frameworks. As a part of the smaller Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) grouping  Antigua and Barbuda fully supports the establishment of an OECS economic union in an effort to build on the shared tradition of our subregional integration arrangements and to expand the areas of shared sovereignty in order to survive and ultimately thrive.  As a member of the CARICOM family  Antigua and Barbuda is proud of its long-standing relationship with the Republic of Cuba. It is my Government’s firm belief that the discriminatory and punitive policies and practices that serve to prevent Cuba from exercising its right freely to participate in the affairs of the hemisphere must be discontinued and with immediate effect. While the winds of change continue to move across the United States of America  I call on the Obama Administration to effect change in its dealings with our sister nation of the Republic of Cuba. I call on the United States of America to end the economic  commercial and financial embargo imposed on our brothers and sisters in Cuba. As a world leader and defender of justice  the United States of America must embrace change fully in the interests of the men  women and children of Cuba.  It is worth reiterating that the parallels between the global economic crisis and the global climate change crisis are both stark and dire for small island developing States. Again  we are faced with the adverse impacts of a crisis that is not of our making but which is threatening — quite literally in the case of some of our sister nations in the Pacific — to wipe us off the face of the Earth. It is a recognized fact  but it is worth repeating  that small island States contribute the least to the causes of climate change  yet we suffer the most from its effects.   At the summit of the Alliance of Small Island States held earlier this week  my country joined with other island States in sending a strong message to the international community on the need for bold and ambitious actions. Small island States have expressed their profound disappointment at the lack of tangible action within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change negotiations to protect small island developing States and other vulnerable countries  their peoples  culture  land and ecosystems.   The responsibility for mitigating climate change is a common responsibility of all nations  be they developed or developing. However  developed countries should shoulder their moral  ethical and historical responsibilities for emitting high levels of anthropogenic greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. It is those actions that have now put the planet in jeopardy and compromised the well-being of present and future generations. Antigua and Barbuda therefore fully supports our sister nation of the People’s Republic of China in its call for developed countries to take up their responsibility to provide new  additional  adequate and predictable financial support to developing countries  which  in effect  represents a joint investment in the future of humankind.   At this pivotal point of the climate change negotiations that will culminate in December  Antigua and Barbuda also anxiously awaits an international agreement significantly to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. A small island nation like ours  which is highly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change  including sea-level rise  coral bleaching and more frequent and intense hurricanes  understands that our fate  our very existence  hangs on the outcome of such an agreement. We wait with bated breath and hope that humanity will show itself worthy of this planet and that nations will have the political will and integrity of leadership to solve the most confounding challenge of our era.  The effects of climate change have forcibly brought home the absolute necessity of better disaster preparedness management and risk reduction. That has been clearly illustrated by several very active hurricane seasons in recent history. Cognizant of this  my Government has upgraded our disaster management capabilities  including strengthening the national disaster office  constructing hurricane shelters and enhancing community resilience. In the spirit of cooperation and solidarity  we look forward to having our development partners make available the necessary resources to enable us to implement our national adaptation plans and programmes. By so doing  they will help to address the adverse effects of climate change that we  the most vulnerable countries  are already experiencing. We urge them to view this as a top-most priority and moral imperative.  Gender equality and women’s empowerment remain centrepieces of the national development strategy of Antigua and Barbuda. Having achieved   35 09-52463  universal primary education  we are proud that our young males and females continue to enjoy equal access and opportunity to education at the primary  secondary and tertiary levels. Further  with a growing number of female parliamentarians and key high-level political positions occupied by women  we continue to improve on our record of female empowerment. The advocacy work of the United Nations system on gender issues has been instrumental in the progress we have made thus far  and we look forward to continuing support as we continue to break down the traditional barriers to the active participation of more than 50 per cent of our country’s human capital.  Transnational crime has burdened our societies with social and financial costs that we cannot afford to bear. Crime prevention and small arms control are priorities for my Government. Our geography has placed us at a major trans-shipment point for transnational organized crime networks trafficking in arms and narcotics.  In recent years  the level of gun violence and gun-related crime has escalated significantly  placing further pressure on an already fragile economy. This has led to insecurity  fear and loss of life in our societies  hampering our development efforts and threatening the general peace and stability of the region. We need greater cooperation from countries  as well as the support of the United Nations system  to eliminate this threat to hemispheric and international peace and security. Antigua and Barbuda is in full support of a legally binding arms trade treaty that will prevent the illegal international transfer of arms and will govern the trade in conventional arms according to common international standards.  As a peace-loving nation  Antigua and Barbuda is also concerned by the lack of progress in the field of disarmament and non-proliferation. We remain steadfast in our commitment to a world free of nuclear weapons. The threat posed by non-State actors acquiring weapons of mass destruction is shared by all countries  large and small. For this reason we support the extension of the mandate of Security Council resolution 1540 (2004). Pursuant to our obligations under that resolution we are pleased to have submitted the relevant reports to the respective Security Council committees.  The trans-shipment of nuclear waste through the waters of the Caribbean also remains a critical issue. The risk of an accident or a terrorist attack on one of these shipments poses a grave threat to the environmental and economic sustainability of the region. Heads of Government of CARICOM and of the wider Association of Caribbean States have consistently called for a total cessation of these shipments in our waters  and we reiterate our strenuous and forceful rejection of the continued use of the Caribbean Sea for the trans-shipment of nuclear and other hazardous waste material.  Finally  as Caribbean people of African descent  our past is clouded by the dark days of the transatlantic slave trade. However  with steady hands  committed minds and innovative plans  a bright future looms with the sunrise. We must ensure that we develop programmes to educate and inculcate in future generations an understanding of the lessons  history and consequences of slavery and the slave trade. We must not forget. We must encourage continued action in this regard. Antigua and Barbuda looks forward to the erection of a permanent memorial to the victims of the transatlantic slave trade and slavery  an initiative being championed by CARICOM. We look forward also to the continuation of serious dialogue and eventual consensus on the issue of reparations.  In conclusion  it is very clear that the multiple and multifaceted nature of the global threats and challenges we face will test the abilities of this assembly of nations and its leaders. Is the United Nations up to the task? Will we  both individually and collectively  heed the admonition of Calvin Coolidge and demonstrate in both word and deed a firm conviction that the welfare of the weakest and the welfare of the most powerful are inseparably bound together? For us  a small island with big aspirations and dreams for the future of our people  we remain hopeful that we will all find the political will and the ability to rise to the task."
"9",345,"AUS",64,2009,"I come to the Assembly  as Australia has each year since the first session of the General Assembly in 1946  and I come in the same spirit  to seek solutions to the great challenges of our age and together help give those solutions effect.  The challenges are not new. They are reflected in the Preamble to the Charter which we  as an international community  crafted together: “to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war”  to advance economic growth and social progress for all  “to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights … in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small”. All those great undertakings were to be reflected in a new body of international law.  Two thirds of a century later these great international values remain constant  while the challenges to which we apply them are subject to continuing change. It is on the current challenges facing the global order that I wish to speak to the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session today: the global financial crisis  the unfinished business of the Doha Round  the unfolding crisis of the planet itself  unresolved questions of nuclear weapons 20 years after the end of the cold war  and the future of global governance itself.  Just on a year ago  just down the road from here  a destructive chain of events triggered the worst global financial crisis in three quarters of a century. It was just on a year ago that I addressed the Assembly for the first time  10 days after the collapse of Lehman   45 09-52228  Brothers  to reflect on the challenges which lay ahead for the proper regulation of global financial markets.  That reform programme is now under way  through the Group of 20 (G-20)  the Financial Stability Board and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). But there remains much work to be done to prevent the unrestrained greed of unregulated financial markets that has wrought such economic carnage across the world in the past 12 months from sowing the seeds of future financial crises.  The global financial crisis has been a wake-up call to the international community to reform the institutions of global governance  and a wake-up call that our system of global governance today is in need of radical reform. Because the truth is that the failure of these institutions is not just a matter of concern for Governments and for diplomats and for economists; the price of the failure of these institutions has been paid by working people and their families right across the world.   The events on Wall Street spread rapidly and indiscriminately to every corner of the globe  from London to Lima  from Beijing to Barcelona  from Melbourne to Mumbai  to developed and developing economies. This global financial crisis and its ensuing economic and employment crisis has been no respecter of national boundaries  and no respecter of peoples.  Australia has been no exception. The global financial crisis saw the Australian stock market fall by 55 per cent. It wiped around A$ 150 billion from the retirement savings of Australian workers. And it led to tens of thousands of Australians losing their jobs. We expect more job losses to follow. Behind each of these statistics lie the faces of working Australians  who have seen their savings diminished  their financial security eroded and their job security threatened.   I think of places like Liverpool in Sydney  where the decline in its light manufacturing base has led to an increase in unemployment of 4.5 per cent over the past year  and where now 19 000 local people are without work; like the tourist destination of Cairns in far North Queensland  where unemployment has risen by 3.7 per cent over the past year  meaning that 13 300 people are now out of work in that area; and like the south-eastern suburbs of Perth  where unemployment has risen by 3.3 per cent in the past year  leaving 12 800 people in that community without a job as well.   In communities like those across Australia the global recession is hurting in very real ways  just as in communities like them across the world the global recession is hurting in very real ways. We can never forget these men  these women  and their families  as we seek to find a path out of this global recession.   While our global economic system failed comprehensively to prevent the crisis  the G-20 Governments have rallied to reduce the damage and prevent systemic collapse. Through the agency of the G-20  for the first time involving heads of Government from the major developed and developing economies  Governments acted in concert to provide around $13.6 trillion-worth of support to directly stabilize the global financial system; to inject $5.5 trillion-worth of fiscal stimulus into the global economy; to provide $1.1 trillion in resources to the international financial institutions  to give markets confidence that any subsequent collapses could be dealt with; to develop also an integrated framework of toxic asset management to repair the balance sheets of many major banks; and to initiate a comprehensive financial markets reform programme  through the Financial Stability Board.   The IMF has assessed that these extraordinary interventions succeeded in breaking the fall in what was an economic crisis spiralling out of control.  But the truth is that our global economic recovery is far from certain  and that many twists and turns lie ahead. Furthermore  the institutions of global economic governance are facing new challenges. First  the financial market reform programme must be completed and implemented to prevent a future crisis. Secondly  in anticipation of global economic recovery  we must agree on a framework for the coordinated withdrawal of our emergency interventions. And  thirdly  and most critically  we must articulate a new framework for sustainable future economic growth  a framework that does not simply return to business as usual  based on unsustainable financial imbalances and excessive consumption  fuelled by consumer and corporate debt and irresponsible risk-taking in systemically significant financial institutions.  One of the failures of the old growth model of the last decade was the lack of effective global economic coordination. This allowed imbalances to grow unchecked and financial institutions to remain inadequately supervised. As we move towards    09-52228 46  recovery  we must build a framework to foster both growth and balance in the global economy. The IMF estimates that effectively implemented coordination between major economies could add significantly to global growth — an additional 10 per cent to global output  or around $6 trillion over a five-year period. To achieve this coordination dividend the G-20 will need to build on the structures of cooperation that have been established during the crisis and apply them to the new challenges of the global recovery.   In Pittsburgh we have a historic opportunity to agree on a framework to deliver effective coordination of our national economic policies. This framework should have four key elements.   First  G-20 members should agree on a common objective to achieve balanced and sustainable growth. Secondly  G-20 members should outline their own national economic strategy and identify how it contributes to our common objectives. Thirdly  the IMF should analyse individual national economic plans to determine whether they are consistent and collectively adequate to achieve sustainable and balanced global growth. And  fourthly  this report should be submitted to the G-20 to form the basis of peer review  which would identify specific risks and vulnerabilities for the future. This framework should be consistent with  and an important input to  the development of a set of global principles  such as the current proposal from Germany for a charter for sustainable economic activity.  The other great global challenge of our age is climate change. With only 74 days remaining until Copenhagen  the Governments of the world are far from agreement. Enough has been said about the need for action on climate change  but as of today not enough action has been taken. Our collective political will to date has not been adequate to meet the task. For too long discussions between developed and developing countries have degenerated into mutual recrimination  with developing countries accusing developed countries of failing to meet their obligations  given their undeniable responsibility for the bulk of greenhouse gas emissions already in the atmosphere  and developed countries warning the major emerging economies that unless they take action global warming will increase to unacceptable levels  based on emerging economy emissions alone.   The trouble is that both arguments are right. What is required globally is the leadership to embrace this truth and respond to it accordingly  because the truth is that all our Governments need to reach beyond their self-interests and instead fashion a grand bargain between the developed and the developing countries of the world: a grand bargain on climate change which embraces both historical and future responsibility; a grand bargain which is anchored in the science of climate change and the need to keep temperature rises within 2 degrees Celsius to avoid catastrophic climate change; a grand bargain embracing the three great challenges of climate change which we are yet to resolve.   Those three challenges are to answer these questions: what binding targets and commitments must developed and developing countries adopt to keep temperature rises within 2 degrees Celsius; what public and private climate change financing arrangements are necessary to support the mitigation and adaptation measures we need to implement in the future; and what technology transfer do we need to undertake in renewable energy  in carbon capture and storage  in energy efficiency and in the avoidance of deforestation and forest degradation to bring about real reductions in greenhouse gas emissions?   In the period ahead  the grand bargain we must strike needs to resolve all three of those challenges  as each is inextricably dependent on the other. We must make use of all available mechanisms for international cooperation  including the Major Economies Forum and the G-20  to achieve success in the negotiations. For us all  this will be a test of our leadership  leadership which seeks to lift our collective vision beyond today and instead focus on the needs of tomorrow.   But time is short. As Chair of the Pacific Islands Forum  I know that time is already running out for the island States of the Pacific. Coastal inundation is not a prospect; it is a reality. Fifty per cent of the population of those island States reside within 1.5 km of the coast. The South Pacific is part of the human face of climate change. And that is why Australia  nationally  regionally and globally  stands ready to play its part in acting on this great moral  environmental and economic challenge of our time.  This Organization was born in the shadow of nuclear weapons; that shadow remains today. One truth   47 09-52228  remains absolutely clear: the proliferation of nuclear weapons can never make any country more secure. The nuclear test by North Korea this year was rightly condemned across the international community. It reiterates that the only path to safety is through the eventual elimination of nuclear weapons. Australia is encouraged by the commitment of the United States and Russia to further reduce their nuclear arsenals  but the international community must also progress the broader disarmament and non-proliferation agenda.   The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty has played a crucial role in limiting the spread of nuclear weapons  but the Treaty today is under grave challenge. We must work to ensure that its global security benefits are reinforced by a successful Review Conference in 2010. To reinvigorate global consensus and activism ahead of that Conference and beyond  Australia and Japan last year established the International Commission on Nuclear Non-proliferation and Disarmament  which in the next few months will produce its final report. Its aim is to chart a practical and realistic course to achieve a strengthened non-proliferation disarmament regime  leading to the ultimate elimination of nuclear arsenals.   Tomorrow’s Security Council summit on non-proliferation and disarmament is important for us all. We must not miss the opportunity it offers to summon the political resolve to move towards a nuclear-weapons-free world.  The challenges of global governance extend beyond the global financial crisis  climate change and the threat of nuclear weapons. The realization of the Millennium Development Goals is fundamental to the elimination of extreme poverty. It remains an obscenity that in 2009  after an age of unprecedented global prosperity  1.5 billion of our fellow human beings are living in extreme poverty. That is a core reason why the Australian Government has committed to increasing official development assistance to 0.5 per cent of gross national income  to help close the development gap which has been widening in many Pacific island countries  while also helping  where    possible  to deal with poverty elsewhere in Asia  Africa  Latin America and the Caribbean.  Parallel to the Millennium Development Goals  the Doha Development Round has now been going for eight years. This is too long. The negotiating gap between us all is not wide  but the deficit in political will to conclude the Round seems vast. As the world searches for a new growth formula to sustain long-term economic recovery  surely Doha represents one critical element? Australia  as one of the lead negotiators within the Doha Round  remains ready to help bridge the negotiating gap.  Let the Assembly also not forget the continuing critical work of the United Nations across the full spectrum of global governance — issues concerning international peacekeeping operations  humanitarian operations  food security  women  health  children and refugees — all hallmarks of a civilized global order.  The United Nations is not a place; it is not an institution. The United Nations is us  “We  the peoples of the United Nations”  as the Charter begins. It is we who must find solutions to the problems we face  build consensus around those solutions  and implement them. This Organization had its beginnings not in an act of will  though will was certainly needed  but in an act of imagination  an idea of what the world should and could be. This is the challenge of leadership: to imagine a future worth having and then craft that vision into a practical and present reality.  That was the challenge to which our forebears rose in 1945. That is the challenge to which our generation must now rise for the future."
"10",392,"AUT",64,2009,"This has been a truly remarkable week  remarkable for the leadership shown by the Secretary-General on climate change  the new policies of President Obama  which he so eloquently set out before us  the constructive responses to those initiatives from many parts of the world and the historic meeting of the Security Council  which committed itself to a world without nuclear weapons. We have all witnessed something new and different: a genuine opportunity for a real renaissance of multilateralism.  There is a real chance to turn the United Nations once again into what was originally envisaged in the Charter: not just a forum for discussion  but a place for action  the central focal point of the efforts of the international community to find common solutions to common challenges. It will depend on each and every Member of the Organization to make sure that this   21 09-52592  historic opportunity is seized. Cooperation is not a mere option  but an indispensable necessity  if we want to succeed.  Together  we must build a world based on predictable and equitable rules applicable to every Member  big or small  strong or weak. Adherence to the rule of law and the principles of the Charter is critical to conflict prevention  stability and sustainable long-term development.  A year ago  Member States entrusted my country with a seat on the Security Council for the years 2009-2010. We take that responsibility very seriously.  One important focus of our work in the Council is to improve the protection of civilians in armed conflict. Despite significant progress  armed conflicts continue to darken the lives of men  women and children in many parts of the world.  Austria has been working actively with others on expanding the monitoring and reporting of serious violations of children’s rights. Austria fully supports Security Council resolution 1820 (2008) and the follow-up resolution to be adopted next week as a decisive response by the international community to sexual violence in conflict situations. At the same time  Austria attaches great importance to the participation of women in the promotion of peace and security. Women must have a voice in every peace process throughout the world.  But many challenges remain. How can we improve the protection of civilians on the ground  in particular in situations in which the Council has provided peacekeeping operations with a clear protection mandate? How can we ensure better compliance by parties to conflict with their obligations under international humanitarian law — for instance  to allow full access for humanitarian assistance? We will therefore use our Security Council presidency in November to identify concrete measures to improve the protection of civilians. In order to do so  I invite all partners to join me in an open debate on 13 November. I am pleased that the Secretary-General has agreed to participate.  In recent years  several peacekeeping missions — such as the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo — have been mandated by the Council to ensure the physical protection of the civilian population.   Its role of providing protection to refugees and internally displaced persons was a strong factor in Austria’s decision to contribute troops to the European Union and United Nations Missions in Chad and the Central African Republic. Austria has also contributed to the United Nations study analysing experience in the implementation of such protection mandates in peace operations. We thus hope to contribute to the overall efforts to reform United Nations peacekeeping. Our aim must be to have more effective and better-resourced peacekeeping missions that are in a position to implement their mandates in a credible and consistent manner.  To achieve sustainable peace  security and development  peacekeeping must be complemented by the rebuilding of functioning institutions  particularly in the judiciary and the security sector. In that context  we commend the efforts of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime in combating corruption  organized crime and drug trafficking.  The Peacebuilding Commission is a new form of partnership between countries emerging from conflict  donors and main providers of personnel to United Nations missions to ensure that support is tailored to specific local needs. Austria is committed to the work of the Peacebuilding Commission  and has recently joined the country-specific configuration for Sierra Leone  a model case for successful peacebuilding.  Sustainable peace can be achieved only when a society also addresses its past. The establishment of effective justice and reconciliation mechanisms at the national level is crucial to end impunity and to ensure the rights of victims. Such efforts can be complemented by international criminal justice mechanisms  such as the ad hoc tribunals and the International Criminal Court.  Peace  security and stability are preconditions for sustainable development. Eradicating extreme poverty and hunger continues to be one of the main challenges facing the international community. Achieving the Millennium Development Goals by 2015 is far from assured. In view of the global financial crisis  increased efforts by the international community are urgently needed. Austria will contribute its share to that global endeavour.  All those efforts will be in vain if we are unable to protect our planet. Climate change is a fundamental threat to humankind  aggravating poverty  hunger     09-52592 22  environmental degradation and insecurity  and thus seriously threatening the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. The United Nations Climate Change Conference to be held in Copenhagen in December must decide on concrete actions to curb climate change on the basis of mutual trust and strong international cooperation.  Climate and energy measures can also be an important part of our response to the current economic crisis. Investments in green technologies and sustainable  affordable and stable energy supplies will benefit both the economy and the climate.  The Security Council summit on nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament held earlier this week issued a strong call for a world free of nuclear weapons. For that vision to become reality  we need progress on several fronts.   Austria  as Co-Chair  together with Costa Rica  of the 2007 Conference on Facilitating the Entry into Force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and co-leader of the process for the past two years  is proud to have contributed to bringing the Treaty closer to entering into force.   As current Chair of the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva  Austria is working hard to translate the recent positive momentum into substantial progress  especially on a verifiable fissile material cut-off treaty.  The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty must be reinforced. The Review Conference of Parties to the Treaty to be held next year will have to agree on a package of measures and procedures that address the key issues  but most of all it will need to build trust and confidence.  Let me continue with three short remarks on conventional disarmament.   First  I appeal to all States to make a success of the Second Review Conference of the Ottawa Landmines Ban Convention  to be held in Colombia in December  and  in particular  to ensure improved assistance to victims.   Secondly  I welcome the growing support for the Convention on Cluster Munitions  which Austria ratified in April. We appeal to all other States to sign and ratify it as soon as possible.  Thirdly  we must counter the illegal proliferation of small arms and light weapons. An arms trade treaty would be an important step in that regard. Hoping to contribute to speedy negotiations  Austria will host an international conference in Vienna in February next year.  With regard to the Iranian nuclear programme  it is indispensable that Iran fully comply with all relevant Security Council resolutions and closely cooperate with the International Atomic Energy Agency. The most recent announcement by the Government of Iran concerning an additional enrichment facility is discouraging and further increases our concern.  As an important regional actor  Iran has the responsibility to contribute to peace and security in the area. The time has now come for Iran to finally enter into a constructive dialogue with the international community. Iran should therefore grasp the hand extended by its international partners and engage in genuine and serious negotiations. The debates during this week have clearly shown that the world will not accept an Iran armed with nuclear weapons.  Let me also underline that Austria firmly rejects the unacceptable remarks made by President Ahmadinejad during his speech on Wednesday. We reject any abuse of the United Nations General Assembly as a platform for intolerance  anti-Semitism  and racial hatred.  Mr. Grauls (Belgium)  Vice-President took the Chair.  Regarding the Middle East  we saw this week’s summit between President Obama  Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Abbas as a sign of hope. We appeal to the parties to remove any remaining obstacles to the early resumption of negotiations.  After decades of hostility and violence  time has come to move decisively forward. Israel’s right to exist in security and peace and the realization of the rights of the Palestinian people to their own State are not mutually exclusive. On the contrary  they are both crucial elements of a comprehensive and just solution.  Austria will continue to help establish the economic foundation and the institutional infrastructure of a future Palestine State. It will also  within the framework of the European Union  contribute to the efforts to promote a dynamic and results-oriented peace process.   23 09-52592   International cooperation and dialogue are the basis for sustainable peace and development. Only by closely working together will we be able to successfully address the many challenges of today’s globalized world. We therefore appreciate President Treki’s initiative to make the need for dialogue a main theme of this week’s debate. Situated in the heart of Europe  and for most of its history at the crossroads of different cultures  religions and political systems  Austria has developed a practice of constructive dialogue as the host country of one of the seats of the United Nations for the past three decades.  I have made it one of my foreign policy priorities to position Austria even more firmly as a platform for peace and dialogue. We stand ready to host international negotiations and provide our services  as we did most recently for the informal talks on Western Sahara. Austria can be counted on to be a partner in translating the words  ideas and initiatives of this week into concrete action."
"11",417,"AZE",64,2009,"I would like to join previous speakers in congratulating His Excellency Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki of Libya on his election to the post of President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. I wish him every success. I should also like to thank his predecessor  Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann  for his work. I would like to express my profound respect and appreciation to the Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon  for his leadership in mobilizing the international community to make our world a better place to live.  We all recognize that the security of every State of the world can be better promoted and ensured with a multilateral security system. That paradigm was a principal reason behind the creation of the collective security system that has the United Nations at its core. Yet  after more than 60 years since the founding of the United Nations  the question remains of whether the contemporary international security architecture is addressing effectively and in a timely manner the multifaceted and interconnected challenges and threats confronting our world today.   The global character of today’s challenges and threats makes geographic distance irrelevant when it comes to the formulation of security policy  as threats as we know them today transcend national borders and entire continents. The indirect repercussions of these threats may be as devastating and as costly as their direct impact. The interconnected and intertwined nature of current threats requires that we reconsider the very concept of security in broader terms that are not confined to the traditional military aspect of security  but also include its political  economic  energy  cultural  information and other dimensions.  The security of each State and  more broadly  international peace and security will depend upon whether States follow the norms and principles of international law and use them as a guiding tool for shaping their foreign and security policies. Following a common set of norms and rules on the international arena contributes to the transparency and predictability of State behaviour and hence consolidates international peace and security.  Unfortunately  the unlawful use of force has still not been eliminated from international relations. Civilian populations are still suffering today in many places around the world due to the manifest failure of individual States to fulfil their most basic and compelling responsibilities. Armed conflict  military aggression and foreign occupation involving the most serious international crimes are but a few vivid examples from our recent history of the bitter consequences of non-compliance by individual States with the norms and principles of international law. Governments that fail to obey the rules of international conduct will inevitably infringe upon individual liberties and freedoms at home  thus undermining democratic development.  The most vivid example of misconduct when it comes to the norms and principles of international law is the almost two-decades-long  and still unresolved  Armenia-Azerbaijan Nagorny-Karabakh conflict  which also stands out as a major threat to international and regional peace and security. As a result of the aggression carried out by Armenia  almost one-fifth of the territory of Azerbaijan has been occupied  approximately 1 million ethnically cleansed Azerbaijanis have become internally displaced persons or refugees and thousands of Azerbaijan’s historical and cultural heritage artifacts have been destroyed or looted.   In its four resolutions on the conflict  the Security Council has reaffirmed the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Azerbaijan and the inadmissibility of the use of force to acquire the territory of the other States. It has also recognized Nagorny-Karabakh as a part of Azerbaijan and called for an immediate  complete and unconditional withdrawal of the occupying forces from all occupied territories of Azerbaijan. The General Assembly — in resolution 62/243  which was adopted   61 09-52470  on 14 March 2008 and which is entitled “The situation in the occupied territories of Azerbaijan” — expressed respect and support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Azerbaijan within its internationally recognized borders.  As reflected in those resolutions  the approach of the General Assembly and the Security Council is fully consistent with the position of Azerbaijan  which from the beginning advocated a step-by-step approach to settling the conflict as the only viable option. A number of important steps have to be taken  starting with the withdrawal of Armenian forces from all the occupied territories  the rehabilitation of those territories  the return of internally displaced persons to their homes in and around the Nagorny-Karabakh region and the opening of all communications channels for mutual use. That will make it possible to eliminate the consequences of the conflict  and will pave the way for the establishment of a durable peace and stability in the region that is conducive to the establishment of the legal status of the Nagorny-Karabakh region within Azerbaijan  with due account taken of  and an equal hearing for  the voices of the Azerbaijani and Armenian communities of the region.  The current settlement process offers some hope of breaking the stalemate in the process of resolution of the conflict. The acceptance by Armenia of the step-by-step approach to a settlement to the conflict on the basis of the principles and norms of international law and the decisions and documents adopted in that framework  as reflected in the joint declaration signed in Moscow in November 2008 by the Presidents of Azerbaijan  Armenia and the Russian Federation  is a positive sign. Azerbaijan is ready to continue talks with Armenia’s leadership for a secure and stable South Caucasus region and beyond  which will make it possible to take advantage of the existing ample regional opportunities for the benefit of all.  Against the background of the negative developments in the region to which I have referred  let me briefly share some information about the positive economic performance of my country.   Azerbaijan has minimized the impact of the global economic downturn on its economy and managed to sustain growth. Having maintained its dynamism in 2009  as of today our gross domestic product (GDP) growth stands at almost 4 per cent. We have recorded a drop in the poverty rate since 2003  from 44 per cent to 13 per cent. The Government of Azerbaijan has substantially improved trade and investment conditions in an effort to strengthen national competitiveness and spur private-sector development  especially in the non-oil sector. Non-oil GDP growth is at almost 16 per cent  the highest rate in 5 years. In recognition of its results-oriented reforms and thought-out economic policy  Azerbaijan was qualified by the World Bank as one of the world’s top reformers.  Azerbaijan — a strategically located country with a young and skilled population  great resources and a dynamic economy — is inevitably taking a leading role in the region and increasingly becoming a pivotal player and credible actor beyond the region. The successful implementation of such infrastructure projects as the Baku-Supsa and Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil-exporting pipelines and the Baku-Tbilisi-Erzurum gas pipeline have not only boosted our economy  they have also contributed to the development of neighbouring States. A modern energy infrastructure coupled with vast energy resources have transformed Azerbaijan into an energy hub of international importance. Azerbaijan has proven itself a reliable partner and an indispensable and secure energy source for Europe and beyond.  Azerbaijan’s location at the crossroads of major East-West and North-South transport corridors and its rapidly developing national transportation infrastructure  which is connected to regional highway and railroad networks  highlights the strategic importance of my country. The completion of the construction of the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railroad and the commissioning of the brand new seaport at Alat  on Azerbaijan’s coast on the Caspian Sea  will increase the role of Azerbaijan as a communications hub linking Europe with Asia.  Azerbaijan has also put forward an initiative to establish a Trans-Eurasian information superhighway  which is expected to serve as a major element of the East-West transport corridor and facilitate the provision of Internet service  telecommunications systems  e-information resources and e-economies to 20 countries of the region.  Today we are living at a time of heightened religious and ethnic awareness  which in certain instances has taken exaggerated forms and is sometimes maliciously exploited to fuel conflicts on    09-52470 62  ethnic  religious or cultural grounds. The broad recognition by the Member States of the United Nations of the role of the dialogue among civilizations  and specifically of inter-cultural and inter-religious harmony in maintaining international peace and security  can only be praised.  We fully support the recommendations of the Secretary-General on the importance of increasing educational efforts to eliminate hate messages  distortion  prejudice and negative bias from textbooks and other educational media and to ensure a basic knowledge and understanding of the world’s main cultures  civilizations and religions.  As a country where long-standing traditions of tolerance and peaceful coexistence of different religions and ethnic groups over centuries have become an inseparable part of the culture  Azerbaijan has repeatedly demonstrated its determination to act as a natural bridge bringing together different continents  cultures and civilizations through the promotion of inter-religious and intercultural dialogue based on mutual respect and understanding among peoples of different cultures and religions.  Azerbaijan was among the first countries to join the Alliance of Civilizations  an initiative by Turkey and Spain. Azerbaijan has hosted a number of important events in recent years  with a view to translating into concrete actions the recommendations contained in the Alliance of Civilizations report of the High-level Group appointed by the Secretary-General. Most recently  we held the Baku International Forum on Expanding the Role of Women in Cross-cultural Dialogue  which we believe will raise awareness about the role of women in that regard. In December 2008  we hosted a conference of culture ministers from Council of Europe member States. For the first time in the history of the Council of Europe  ministers from member States of the Islamic Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization and the Arab League Educational  Cultural and Scientific Organization joined the event. The Baku declaration adopted at the conference envisages  inter alia  an intercultural dialogue between European and neighbouring States.  At the fifth Islamic Conference of Culture Ministers  Azerbaijan’s capital of Baku was declared the Islamic culture capital for 2009. This autumn we will be hosting the sixth Conference of Ministers of Culture of the Organization of the Islamic Conference  where we will continue discussions of our future actions in fostering dialogue among civilizations.  The multilateral system  with the United Nations at its heart  is undergoing serious changes that will test its strength  viability and credibility. This requires more dedicated efforts aimed at strengthening the United Nations and promoting the effectiveness of the Organization through the implementation of its decisions and resolutions. Azerbaijan believes that  as the only truly global organization  the United Nations has to be stronger and capable of engaging on a range of pressing global issues in every part of the world  as well as addressing the aspirations and concerns of each Member State. We continue to support reform of the Organization so that it may be renewed and revitalized and made more responsive."
"12",463,"BDI",64,2009,"It is an honour to take the floor at the sixty-fourth session of the General Assembly.   At the outset  on behalf of His Excellency Mr. Pierre Nkurunziza  President of the Republic of Burundi  and our entire delegation  we join preceding speakers in warmly congratulating you  Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki  on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. Your election is a tribute to you and to your country. My delegation and I personally wish you every success in your noble mission. Our congratulations go also to the other members of the Bureau. We also take this opportunity to pay a well-deserved tribute to your predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann  for his commitment and for the quality of the work accomplished during his mandate.   Here  we wish to reaffirm our support for His Excellency Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. Once again  we wish him every success and assure him of the full cooperation of the Republic of Burundi in seeking peaceful and courageous solutions to the problems facing today’s world. We hail him in particular for his devotion to the cause of peace and development  which he has continued to demonstrate for the world in general and for Burundi in particular.   Finally  our gratitude goes to the international community  the Peacebuilding Commission  the United Nations Integrated Office in Burundi  the European Union  the Regional Initiative for Burundi and the Republic of South Africa for their efforts to restore peace  which is now a reality and which we hope will be irreversible in Burundi. We urge all States in the Great Lakes region to continue to engage in dialogue and cooperation to ensure comprehensive political stability and development in the region. We take this opportunity to request that consultative status in the General Assembly be granted at this session to the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region.  The present session of the General Assembly is taking place at a time when the Burundian people are welcoming the progress made on the path of peace. Indeed  the war in Burundi is now over. The last rebel    09-52586 2  movement  the Forces nationales de liberation  has laid down its weapons and has become a political party that is actively participating in the country’s democratic life. The movement’s top leaders have been appointed to posts in the area of public administration. Some former combatants have joined the army or the police  and the others have been demobilized and are benefiting from the process of reintegrating into normal socio-economic life. We wish to thank all our partners for their support for Burundi’s considerable peacebuilding and democratization efforts.   With the return of peace and democratically elected institutions  the Burundian people are beginning to regain confidence in the institutions of the Republic. Internally displaced persons (IDPs) are returning to their former villages  and Burundian refugees who were in neighbouring countries have returned. However  the reintegration of former combatants  IDPs and refugees is not taking place without difficulties or constraints.   Indeed  Burundi  as an African country with one of the highest population growth rates  has an acute land-shortage problem  which has given rise to property disputes. In order to preserve social harmony  a commission for land and other assets has been established to resolve all disputes arising between repatriated persons and their fellow citizens who have remained in the hills  where land is considered a unique treasure.  Burundi is facing the problem of financing the professional reintegration of thousands of men  women and even children who have served as combatants. The international community’s support is thus essential to assist us in the process of socially reintegrating those sectors of the needy population so that the gains of peacebuilding will not be undermined.   Furthermore  the Burundian Government recognizes that illegal firearms in the hands of the civilian population constitute a serious threat to peace. In order to address that problem  the Government has established a commission to encourage people to voluntarily turn in their weapons. As the commission has a time-bound mandate  the Government has launched a large-scale programme to recover all weapons and clamp down on crime linked to firearm use. A decree regulating legal firearms possession has just been signed by the President.   Judicial reform is being carried out to ensure equitable justice and combat impunity. The Government welcomes the support of the international community in this area. To further consolidate the peace dividend  we must meet the challenges of knowing the truth so that we can achieve national reconciliation. It is imperative that the Burundian people succeed in the transitional justice process. That will enable them to bury the hatchet of war and build their future on a solid foundation of peace and mutual trust.  Mindful of the fact that it would not enjoy peace for long in a troubled Africa  our country has responded positively to the international community’s appeal to contribute to peacekeeping in countries at war. Thus  Burundi is participating in the United Nations Operation in Côte d’Ivoire  to restore peace to Côte d’Ivoire; the United Nations Peacebuilding Support Office in the Central African Republic  in Chad and the Central African Republic; and the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur  in Darfur and Somalia. Unfortunately  our contingent deployed in Somalia as part of the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) has  over a two-year period  been the target of three suicide attacks that have claimed the lives of 25 soldiers and left 35 others wounded. To that grisly toll  we must add three victims of the crash of an Ilyushin aircraft into Lake Victoria in March this year.  Those facts show that Burundi is paying a heavy price in the international mission to contribute to the quest for peace in Somalia. Because of this loss of life  some in Burundi are calling for a troop withdrawal. We believe that  in its current configuration  the Mission can continue and be completed only with considerable efforts by the international community.   To that end  the Government of Burundi believes that AMISOM’s mandate should be changed to allow contingents to protect themselves against deadly attacks and to take the offensive or pursue aggressors  if necessary  in accordance with Chapter VII of the Charter. We believe that contingents must be equipped with sufficient resources in terms of quality and quantity. We believe that strike helicopters and funds for information-gathering on the ground must be provided. We also believe that additional troops should be deployed without delay in order to make the Mission truly continental in character. And we believe that the long-promised sanctions against countries    3 09-52586  organizations and individuals who support Islamist groups should at last become a reality.   The Government of Burundi remains steadfast to its commitments vis-à-vis AMISOM. However  we would like to see the international community respond as soon as possible to the concerns that I have expressed here  which are well-known to all partners who wish to see the return of peace in the Horn of Africa.   This meeting is taking place a few months before the holding of general elections in my country aimed at reinvigorating institutions at every level. I would like to underscore here that the Government is committed to making sure that those elections are transparent and that they are held in an atmosphere of calm. An independent national electoral commission has already been put in place  based on a political compromise between the various parties. In addition  a new electoral law has just been promulgated. The Ministry of the Interior has also been strengthened in order to support the commission. The partnership between the electoral commission  the Government and donors has just been formalized through an agreement between the United Nations Development Programme and the Government of Burundi on a project to provide support for the elections.   In that regard  the Government will provide the independent national electoral commission a $7 million package for the entire endeavour. We are counting on the varied support of the international community to mobilize all the necessary resources to make the electoral process a success. We welcome the willingness expressed by the Secretary-General to bring BINUB’s mandate in line with the electoral environment. I need not recall that BINUB’s mandate should be agreed between now and the end of December of this year. A successful outcome to the elections will enable us  in coordination with the Secretary-General  to redefine the mission of the United Nations in Burundi by focusing major attention on programmes aimed at lasting development.  Burundi must make a success of its electoral process if it is to be able to pursue its economic development. Our strategic framework to combat poverty  which is the point of reference for all efforts in that regard  has been in the process of implementation since 2007. An assessment of that effort over the past two years reveals satisfactory results overall  despite the fact that the performance indicators we wanted to achieve with regard to certain macroeconomic policies have not yet been realized.  In an effort to improve the effectiveness of the assistance provided to Burundi  the Government  working in partnership with donors  has put in place a partners’ coordination group that provides a forum for discussion in which development partners are consulted on all technical and policy issues in connection with the implementation of our national strategy on development and peacebuilding. Today  genuine dialogue and active partnership take place throughout the process  from the planning to the results assessment stages.  With the support of the World Bank  Burundi hopes to hold a meeting of the Ad Hoc Advisory Group on Burundi next month in Paris  with a view to mobilizing funds destined for sectors that have been identified as having the potential for quickly contributing to economic growth and playing a catalysing role — namely  those of the energy  agricultural  private sector  tourism  information technology and communication infrastructure sectors. We count on the existing partnership to provide the necessary financing.  The Government has come to understand that  in order to fully restart economic growth  it needs to promote good governance in the management of public affairs and further improve the business environment. To that end  the Government  with the support of its partners  has begun a series of reforms aimed at improving public finance management and facilitating private domestic and foreign investment in our country. A new investment law has therefore been promulgated  which the Government has adapted to bring it in line with the East African Community’s model. A value added tax is already in place and an agency to promote investment will soon become operational.   Burundi aims to meet the challenge set at the international level to achieve the Millennium Development Goals  as underscored in the Outcome adopted at the September 2005 World Summit of heads of State or Government (resolution 60/1). We are pleased to inform the Assembly that  thanks to our policy of free primary education and health care for children under the age of five and pregnant women  Burundi is achieving results that merit support. For instance  thanks to that policy  the number of pregnant    09-52586 4  women giving birth in hospitals or health centres increased from 22.9 per cent in 2005 to 56.3 per cent in 2008.  In July 2009  the Government of Burundi decided to provide free malaria treatment and mosquito nets for its entire population. The Government has also decided to take responsibility for the medical treatment and follow-up for women beginning in the first month of pregnancy  with a view to better protecting the health of mothers and children. That policy includes an information campaign aimed at curbing the number of births. A national body will soon be established that will be responsible for providing health insurance for people living in rural areas or working in the informal sector.   Education for all is another of the Millennium Development Goals that the people of Burundi are working to achieve. Thanks to community development efforts  our people built more than 700 schools and health centres in the course of 2008  so as to allow all school-age children to benefit from free primary education  as decided in 2005 by our country’s President. However  we still face the ongoing problem of providing the necessary financial resources to equip those schools and health centres  provide them with drinking water and pay their staff. I need not point out that these exceptional steps have been taken to contribute to our country’s progress in the run-up to 2015.  Moreover  the Government would like donors to mobilize additional resources to ensure the sustainability of our achievements. We would like to take this opportunity to heartily thank partners that have already supported the implementation of our policy to provide free primary education and health services for pregnant women and children under the age of five. We appeal to those who are still hesitant to come to our assistance in order to help us to overcome the numerous challenges to which I have referred here.  The global financial crisis has not spared Burundi. While the cost of raw materials has dropped in general  the decrease has been especially sharp in the price of coffee  which is our main export product. The Assembly will of course understand that  when our gross domestic product and our economy’s macroeconomic indicators perform poorly  they undermine the social protection efforts undertaken by the Government.   The volatile market for petroleum products also has a destabilizing impact on Burundi’s economy  as it produces external shocks that are difficult to bear. Despite the economic policy interventions that have been taken to counteract the negative effects of disturbances in international markets  the economies of developing countries must nevertheless reiterate the appeal for restoring order with regard to such current issues as those pertaining to the stability of international financial markets  the implementation of trade agreements  technology transfers and the need to increase assistance and investment in Africa.   Given the situation  we would like once again to invite developed countries and the Group of Eight in particular to translate into action the commitment they undertook to raise official development assistance contributions to 0.7 per cent of GDP by 2015  as well as to honour the promise made in Scotland to increase development aid by $50 billion per year starting in 2010  with half of this sum allocated to Africa.  Climate change constitutes a threat to peace and food security in Africa and around the world. We therefore call for the adoption of courageous measures to limit the production of greenhouse gases and for incentives to encourage reforestation policies  the protection of equatorial forests  the responsible management of water and energy resources  and the use of clean and renewable energies. Burundi endorses the common African Union position that was set out by the Prime Minister of Ethiopia and will be reaffirmed at the Copenhagen Conference. We welcome measures announced by President Barack Obama  the European Union and Japan to considerably reduce greenhouse gas emissions  manage toxic waste responsibly and provide financial and technological resources to least-developed and landlocked countries.  Burundi renews its pledge to the United Nations to continue working to ensure that the peoples of the entire world cooperate in peace and defend the values of freedom  solidarity and tolerance. These values must guide the international community in resolving the bloody conflicts that threaten some parts of Africa  the Middle East  Iraq and Afghanistan  and will help us to fight terrorism and other forms of transnational crime effectively.   I cannot conclude my address without reaffirming the commitment of my country to multilateralism    5 09-52586  which represents our single best hope for responding to all threats to peace and security in the world."
"13",510,"BEL",64,2009,"Nothing is created without men; nothing lasts without institutions. Those words of Jean Monnet  one of the founders of the European Union  remain as true as ever. Security  climate change and some effects of globalization are challenges that all our countries face. That is why a global approach  with the United Nations playing a central role  is needed. But the United Nations must earn that central role. As President Barack Obama said here (see )  we cannot complain  on the one hand  about the so-called unilateral action of the United States while at the same time expecting it alone to solve all the world’s problems.   In that spirit I would call for a new multilateral commitment  as the reform of international institutions is crucial in order to enhance their legitimacy  representativeness and capacity for action. Nothing is created without men; nothing lasts without institutions. From now on  those institutions should work efficiently  starting with the United Nations. It is essential to move ahead rapidly on the reform of the Security Council and of the functioning of the General Assembly.  Indeed  there is an urgent need to improve the efficiency of our own operations. A glance at the organizational chart of the United Nations allows us to see not only the overlaps but also the gaps in the system. It is out of commitment to the Charter of the United Nations that Belgium  one of the founding Members  strongly appeals for more rigour and transparency in the management and budget of the United Nations in order to better use its limited resources.   In addition to the fragmentation of the United Nations system  two other trends reveal the need for enhanced multilateral commitment. The first is the multitude of regional and subregional organizations almost everywhere in the world. It is true that this multitude enhances international cooperation  but regional and international organizations sometimes lack harmonization. Better cooperation should henceforth allow the optimal use of the resources of all.  The second trend can be summed up by the words “imperfect multilateralism”. Countries get together on an informal basis to discuss international issues  for example — and this is very pertinent — the economic and financial crisis. These informal groups may  particularly at first  expedite the decision-making of international multilateral organizations  but they cannot replace those organizations themselves because multilateralism cannot be exclusive. Rather  it should    09-52592 26  be inclusive and transparent. Nothing can last without institutions  but even the best organized institutions cannot function in the absence of inspiration and human will. Even the best organized institutions are powerless when men prevent them from working.   The economic and financial crisis has been given a great deal of attention  which is only natural. The crisis most severely affects developing countries. It is now more important than ever that donor countries meet their official development assistance objectives of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product. Belgium plans to achieve that goal in 2010.  The worst international disorder is violence between States and within States. Within some States  violence continues to kill  maim and rape millions of people. The worst international disorder is reflected in the wars  civil conflicts  inter-ethnic fighting and harsh repression that deprive millions of people of a decent existence. This is our first and foremost challenge because without peace and security there is no development  let alone sustainable development. Without peace and security  there can be no fair distribution of the wealth of our Earth.  As stipulated in the preamble of the Constitution of UNESCO    “since wars begin in the minds of men  it is in the minds of men that the defences of peace must be constructed”. Indeed  conflict prevention begins with the banishment of all hate speech attacking the dignity of human beings  nations and communities  or the right of States to exist. Far too often  we have witnessed bloodbaths provoked by incitement to hatred. Such speech has no place in this Hall or in this Organization  whose primary mission is precisely to promote peace and security through constructive cooperation.  To function efficiently  our multilateral institutions need leaders and representatives of States who share basic approaches established on the core belief in the unique dignity of each human being. National sovereignty implies responsibility. That is why Belgium wholeheartedly supports the principle of the responsibility to protect. The principle requires Governments to safeguard their citizens against genocide  war crimes  ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. Incidentally  Belgium would like to thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his excellent report on this topic (A/63/677) and fully supports his efforts in this area.  It is civilians  and women and children in particular  who are often the primary victims of violence and of indescribable and unacceptable suffering. Indeed  women constitute half of the world’s population  but too often we forget that human rights also fully apply to them. In situations of war and violence  women are frequently twofold victims because of the sexual violence inflicted upon them. My country is therefore determined to pursue its action against sexual violence and any kind of violence against children.  Wars are caused by men  not by weapons. Nonetheless  the arms control issue has to be high on the international agenda. That is why Belgium welcomes the meeting of the Security Council at the highest level on the subject of non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament (S/PV.6191). That meeting was undoubtedly a highlight of this week. Resolution 1887 (2009)  adopted yesterday  represents  in our opinion  a milestone for a world free of weapons of mass destruction.  However  unfortunately  the latest news from Iran seems to be heading in the opposite direction. My country therefore endorses the very urgent call on Iran and North Korea to cooperate with the international community and respect the Security Council resolutions that pertain to them. If they do not  they will be ostracized by the international community.  At the same time  the fight against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction should not make us overlook conventional weapons  which currently kill on a massive scale. In particular  I refer here to anti-personnel landmines. The Convention that prohibits these weapons entered into force in 1999  and Belgium hopes that it will be strengthened at the Review Conference scheduled to take place in Cartagena  Colombia  in early December. With respect to that Convention  Belgium  along with Thailand  will head the Standing Committee on Victim Assistance and Socio-Economic Reintegration. Furthermore  Belgium has spared no effort to push for the conclusion of the Convention on Cluster Munitions.  Human rights in all their aspects are a major concern for Belgium. That is why my country plays an active role as a member of the Human Rights Council. In that regard  I would like to thank the members of the   27 09-52592  Council that entrusted my country  Belgium  with the responsibility and honour to preside over that important institution. That trust is  in my view  a recognition of our commitment.  Finally  human rights also concern the rights of future generations. We do not own this Earth; we have it on loan from our children. Today more than ever  that heritage is threatened  and that is why environmental protection should be our main shared concern and priority. The Climate Change Conference scheduled for late 2009 in Copenhagen is an opportunity that cannot be squandered. We need to make specific and binding commitments there. I believe that the European Union has shown the way with its ambitious package of measures adopted in late 2008.  Institutions cannot function without the input of men. Therefore  those who undermine the performance of these institutions should be held accountable. That is why Belgium has been particularly active in the fight against impunity. An international legal order is required  but it can function only if it is upheld by States governed by the rule of law. I therefore reaffirm the need for common positions that are essential for a world that is safer  fairer and more prosperous. In the words of former Secretary-General Kofi Annan    “There is no long-term security without development. There is no development without security. And no society can long remain secure  or prosperous  without respect for human rights and the rule of law.” (Press release SG/SM/10425) Strengthening the rule of law at the national and international levels is more vital than ever for achieving a more equitable form of globalization.  I will conclude with these words. Peace and security  sustainable development  and a fair distribution of the wealth of the Earth are the essential  global challenges that we face. To meet these challenges  we need solid international institutions  but institutional multilateralism is not enough. We also need a multilateralism of minds  and men and women of conviction to carry it forward.   This will  belief and ambition motivate my country  a founding Member of the United Nations  to offer the candidacy for the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session of our compatriot Louis Michel  former Minister for Foreign affairs of Belgium and former European Commissioner in charge of Development and Humanitarian Aid. We are convinced that the strength of his conviction and dedication will unite us further. It is indeed only when the men and women who take the floor here are fired by a shared vision of human rights  peace and development that our institutions will be able to deliver what we need: collective results rather than individual achievements."
"14",555,"BEN",64,2009,"I should like at the outset to express my pleasure at seeing Mr. Treki so brilliantly execute the lofty tasks of the presidency of the General Assembly on behalf of Africa. I offer him my warmest congratulations and wish him every success in that office. I also take this opportunity to pay tribute to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for the sincere commitment that he has shown.  The path laid down by the founding fathers of the United Nations for the achievement of its goals is that of dialogue and multilateralism. The United Nations was created to harness the energies of the international community to that end. Soon  we will have been at it for seven decades. Where are we today? Painful fractures hinder humankind and threaten to considerably weaken our capacity for common action. The multifaceted crises that have shaken the global economy have been caused by its accelerated globalization without agreed global governance. These crises have mightily stricken the most vulnerable. Furthermore  they have exposed the planet to grave dangers  the signs of which are undeniably evident.  We should accept the facts. The time for assumptions has passed. The time has come for proactive anticipation  as we now know the cost of indifference  inertia and passivity. We must restore the capacity of the United Nations to fulfil its calling in the pursuit of solutions to the global problems of humankind. Through the dialogue of civilizations  we should reconcile the specificities connected with the diversity of our cultural heritage with the universal standards that arise from the inviolability of human dignity.  The dialogue of civilizations is without doubt an essential precondition for strengthening multilateralism. It can help us return to the fundamental values of respect for life and for nature  awareness of our common destiny  the quest for mutual benefit  and the sense of permanence  sharing and honouring our responsibilities towards future generations. If we wish to reverse the dismal trends and outlook that scientists have described  we must conclude a new alliance between man and nature — a new common agreement. That is how we can regain control of the natural and anthropogenic phenomena that affect our existence on Earth. The Copenhagen Conference in December will be an excellent opportunity that we must not squander.  Above all  we should create conditions to ensure the responsible contribution of all to fully realizing the potential of humankind. To that end  we must eliminate all obstacles to its development. The State and public authorities have a vital role to play in that regard. They must at all times engage with social partners working in the service of freedom and progress.  The independent Commission on Legal Empowerment of the Poor has shown us the virtues of gradually eliminating old practices that violate the integrity of the individual both as a living being and as a legal and social entity. That is a fundamental precondition to guaranteeing the responsible access of all to the benefits of modernity and shared prosperity. That is why Benin has committed to organizing the regional conference on revitalizing the major recommendations of the independent Commission.  To that end also  my country has declared a resolute war on female genital mutilation through an awareness campaign  the retraining of practitioners and the vigilant enforcement of unambiguous legislation  bolstered by a new family code that establishes the equal rights of men and women. That is also why Benin worked for the proclamation of 2009 as the International Year of Human Rights Learning. The main objective of the Year is to promote the necessary change in thinking to ensure that humankind moves towards full and complete adherence to the universal values enshrined in the United Nations Charter.  The United Nations must be more effective in supporting national policies to achieve international standards. The Beninese Government has decided to entrust the rationalization of its efforts in favour of women to a recently established women’s institute. To that end  we are very pleased to welcome the imminent establishment and operationalization of a composite entity within the United Nations system for the advancement of gender equality. It will make it possible to ensure the coherent and efficient support of the United Nations system for the efforts of Member States.  In the context of Africa’s resolute march towards a new beginning  the Beninese Government has adopted strategic measures based on the elimination of    09-52470 56  poverty and on reinvigorated economic growth that will make Benin an emerging country by 2025. The challenges to be met are huge since nearly one third of the population of Benin currently lives below the poverty line in a country vulnerable to the threats of natural disasters and where food security is not fully guaranteed.  The measures implemented in particular by the Government of Mr. Boni Yayi  in place since April 2006 thanks to scrupulous respect for our Constitution  mark our resolve to move forward. Our economic performance in 2006 and 2007 proved that our strategic choices were correct. These measures included promoting microfinancing as an effective means of fighting poverty and social exclusion  especially that of women  by granting microcredit to the poorest — especially women  who are the most important pillar of society although economically disadvantaged; promoting entrepreneurship and youth employment; and the launching of multiple training programmes in order to integrate young people into the fabric of our socio-economic structure. We are also working on mechanizing agriculture  promoting education by offering free and mandatory primary education  and making free Caesarean sections available as a better approach to reproductive health.  These social measures were implemented at the same time that major work was begun on infrastructure. However  the ongoing economic recession and the worsening harmful consequences of climate change threaten to seriously jeopardize the considerable progress made in implementing this pivotal national project.  Only one year ago  the International Monetary Fund predicted that the gross domestic product of sub-Saharan African countries would increase by 6.7 per cent on average in 2009. Those forecasts were revised downward a few months later to 5.1 per cent  then to 3.5 per cent and last March to 3.25 per cent  and nothing guarantees that the growth rate will not decline further.  This decline in the growth rate has aggravated the danger of serious budgetary difficulties. We must maintain our rate of progress despite being subjected to the gruelling external shocks of the successive crises of the world economy in full recession. We are making considerable efforts to mobilize our internal resources. We welcome the good work done by the United Nations to mobilize additional resources from development partners in order to help pilot countries  including Benin  to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. These decisions were taken in the context of implementing the commitments made by the Group of Eight at Gleneagles  the Millennium Declaration  the 2001 Brussels Declaration on least developed countries  and all of the statements that we warmly welcomed and applauded at the recent Summit on Climate Change convened here by the Secretary-General.  The consequences of climate change considerably complicate the deal. Benin is among the most vulnerable countries and those least equipped to address climate change. In addition to torrential rains that are concentrated in just a few weeks of the year  coastal erosion due mainly to the rise in sea level has already been observed in Benin and neighbouring countries. We also have long and recurrent droughts and other natural disasters that are affecting our peoples. Scientists predict that  among other events  the coastal areas of West Africa will be submerged due to the rise in sea level of the Atlantic Ocean  whereas northern countries have already gained land along their coastlines.  We therefore need help to acquire the technologies and means necessary to combat coastal erosion because we cannot sit idly by while this disaster unfolds. In order to counter the coastal erosion already engulfing our cities and coastal lands  major work on infrastructure is crucial. Actions to be taken will be effective only if undertaken at the level of the entire subregion so as to ensure that all of the West African coastline is protected. To that end  we must mobilize vast resources. Perhaps we should consider establishing a multilateral investment fund  under the auspices of the United Nations and the African Union  to finance the major construction work that will be needed.  We need a United Nations able to coordinate the response to these major development challenges  raise the necessary resources to respond to the financial needs  and supervise the transfer of resources to be used by the international community to help the most vulnerable countries  including the least developed. We need a United Nations with the moral authority to involve the affluent countries in thorough reform of the architecture of governance and of economic and financial globalization in order to improve the capacity   57 09-52470  of the international financial system to promote equitable development in all regions of the world.  The initiatives of the Group of Twenty in this area are laudable and must continue to ensure a thorough reform of the international economic system that will allow all countries to be integrated into the virtuous cycle of economic growth and sustainable development. We need a United Nations able to help emerging countries fully to shoulder the international commitments linked to their new status and to exploit their strengths to promote South-South and triangular cooperation in order to achieve the Millennium Development Goals and to better adapt to climate change. Convinced that another name for peace is development and that peace and development are essential to our survival on Earth  we must find the essential means to promote peace through and for development.  We need a United Nations able to assure the effective prevention of armed conflict  if necessary by fielding robust peace or development missions to conduct operations for economic stabilization and the elimination of extreme poverty. We need a United Nations that makes full use of the opportunities for cooperation with regional organizations. In that connection  Benin calls for consistent implementation of the proposals made in the Prodi report (S/2008/813  annex) on cooperation between the United Nations and the African Union on modalities for support to African Union peacekeeping operations.  We need a United Nations with strengthened capacities to contribute to the peaceful settlement of disputes  inter alia  through mediation and the promotion of judicial settlements. We need a United Nations capable of rising to the challenges involved in settling the Palestinian question definitively; promoting disarmament and the regulation of the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction; promoting the rule of law at the national and international levels; promoting fair trade; countering terrorism and organized transnational crime; exercising the responsibility to protect; fighting impunity by strengthening international justice; and protecting civilians  in particular children  women and the elderly in situations of armed conflict; and so on.  United Nations reform must be undertaken without hesitation in order to strengthen its effectiveness  legitimacy and credibility. Security Council reform through expansion in both categories of membership is  among other things  an unavoidable necessity of our times  as the Chairman of the African Union affirmed from this rostrum a few days ago.  The time has come to grant all peoples of the Earth their due place in the concert of free and prosperous nations. Benin is ready to cooperate without reservation in finding the most appropriate ways to redress the injustices of the past and to establish a new world order in the Security Council. Such an order must enable humankind to forge its common destiny in our common house  namely  the Earth. We have a sacred duty towards our planet  which includes behaving in a manner that serves to preserve its habitability for current and future generations. Yes  we need a United Nations that is more just and better able to respond to today’s urgent needs as well as to the aspirations of the world’s most vulnerable people."
"15",601,"BFA",64,2009,"The sixty-fourth session of the General Assembly is being held at a time when the international community  faced with numerous crises  is seeking ways to build a world of shared peace and development. However  although the political and economic consequences of the current financial crisis affect the whole world  they are and will continue to be more severe for African countries  given their fragility and the limited diversity of their economies.  Is it fair that those who have not caused this tremendous international upheaval should pay the highest price? It certainly is not. That is why  in the face of the deep recession besetting the entire planet  it is important to bolster partnerships for development in order to correct the dysfunctions of the currently failing global economic system. I welcome the incisive conclusions of the high-level Conference on the financial and economic crisis  which could lead to the establishment of a more virtuous world government assuring sustainable development for all States.  In order to relaunch growth  achieve full employment and restore confidence  it is essential that    09-52463 14  we adopt strict rules to regulate and manage the international financial system. At the same time  it will be necessary to increase aid to developing countries in order to help achieve the Millennium Development Goals.  On 1 September 2009  Burkina Faso experienced floods that caused extensive loss of life and material damage. I reiterate my deepest thanks to the friends and partners who have supported us in dealing with the consequences of this natural disaster. The growing frequency of such events all over the world is due to the effects of climate change. We must therefore take action to address the pressing need to come up with appropriate solutions. In this regard  I welcome the marked convergence of views and the mobilization of the international community in connection with the issue of climate change.  The fifteenth United Nations Conference on Climate Change  to be held from 7 to 18 December in Copenhagen  will offer countries a prime opportunity to take bold decisions to protect our generation and our planet from the effects of global warming. It is to that end that Burkina Faso will host  from 9 to 11 October in Ouagadougou  the Seventh World Forum of Sustainable Development in the context of climate change. This event will allow Africa  a continent ill-equipped to resist and adapt to the consequences of climate change  to amplify its contribution to the global debate on this issue.  The recurring conflicts affecting the world are a genuine threat to peace and international security  as well as a serious obstacle to the economic and social progress of nations. Burkina Faso wishes to express its deep concern over the current situation in Darfur and southern Sudan  and reiterates its commitment to working with the Sudanese people in their quest for peace. In that connection  Burkina Faso will dispatch a military battalion to join the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur  as well as a formed police unit to assist in peacekeeping operations. The support of the international community for the efforts of the Joint African Union-United Nations Mediator to create conditions for productive dialogue and forge a lasting peace agreement between the principal parties is essential.  The equally tragic situation in Somalia calls for genuine support for the Transitional Federal Government so that it can definitively restore security throughout the country and in Somali territorial waters. Burkina Faso is also following political developments in Guinea and Madagascar with particular interest. I urge the various political actors in those two countries to engage in constructive dialogue with all stakeholders to ensure a rapid return to the constitutional order.  I congratulate the African Union and the subregional organizations for the efforts they have made to find satisfactory solutions to numerous hotspots of tension on the continent. The holding of presidential elections in Guinea-Bissau is an example of success on the part of the international community. In particular  I encourage the Peacebuilding Commission to support the Government of Guinea-Bissau in the reconstruction of the country.  In Côte d’Ivoire and Togo  the political actors’ commitment to ensuring the effective implementation of the accords to end the crises in those countries affords real reason to hope for the organization of regular and transparent presidential elections in future. I welcome the Security Council’s unflagging readiness to work with Côte d’Ivoire on implementing the Ouagadougou Political Agreement  and I encourage it to continue to pursue its efforts to achieve peaceful solutions to conflicts.  In regard to the matter of Western Sahara  Burkina Faso reaffirms its endorsement of Security Council resolution 1813 (2008)  supports the Secretary-General’s efforts to find a political solution  and considers the Moroccan initiative to negotiate autonomy for the Western Sahara to be an appropriate way to settle the disagreement.   In the Middle East  we welcome the successful conduct of elections in Lebanon and encourage that country to improve its relations with Syria and Israel. The restoration of stability and prospects for normalized relations with Lebanon’s neighbours represent an opportunity for calm consideration of a global settlement of the Palestinian question.   The contribution of the Republic of China on Taiwan to assisting the least developed countries should be commended  and its participation in the previous session of the World Health Assembly augurs well for the positive evolution of this country’s contribution to the life of the international community.  For some years  the question of the proliferation of nuclear weapons  which pose an enormous threat    15 09-52463  has divided the international community. I thank and encourage President Obama for his successful organization and leadership of the Security Council summit on disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation. The commitments made could lead to a denuclearized world that is more ambitious in its exploitation of nuclear power for civil purposes and more vigilant in policing illicit trafficking in nuclear materials.  The reform of the United Nations  which has been on our agenda for more than a decade  calls for a cautious but determined approach  particular as regards the Security Council. I express the hope that negotiations will soon be undertaken regarding the fair and equitable representation of all regions of the world  the strengthening of the effectiveness of the Council’s role and the revitalization of the General Assembly. True to the ideals of the United Nations  Burkina Faso will make its contribution to the various issues and actions under way to endow our global Organization with the vitality and authority essential to taking on the new challenges on the horizon."
"16",644,"BGD",64,2009,"With your permission  Sir  I would like to speak in Bangla  my mother tongue. I would like to warmly congratulate the President on his well-deserved election to preside over the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. I am confident that his wise and able leadership will guide the Assembly’s deliberations to a successful conclusion. I would also like to express my deep appreciation to His Excellency Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann  President of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session  for his sound leadership in successfully steering the Assembly’s work during his tenure. I should also like to pay tribute to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his tireless and dedicated efforts to reinvigorate the United Nations.  Thirty-five years ago  the father of our nation and my father  Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman  in his first address to the General Assembly from this rostrum  expressed his gratitude to all who supported our struggle for independence. He also declared his commitment to democracy  good governance  human rights and the rule of law. It is also my proud privilege and great honour to extend the same commitment here today on behalf of our country.  As members may know  for many years following the brutal assassination of Bangabandhu and 18 other members of our family  on 15 August 1975  by misguided armed mutineers  Bangladesh was ruled by dictators and quasi-dictators. Aside from a period in the 1990s  the country continued to suffer from unconstitutional rule  particularly in the most recent years. Even I was sent into forced exile. But the will of the people of Bangladesh and the good will of the international community permitted my return home and the holding of nation-wide elections on 29 December 2008.  Universally acclaimed as free  fair and credible  and carried out under the supervision of United Nations and international observers  the elections heralded democracy in Bangladesh. The resounding victory of my party  the Awami League  reflected the people’s preference for democratic ideals  secularism and an outright denial of all forms of extremism. The elections included record high participation by young voters and women.  The huge mandate given by the voters to my Government also entrusted it with an equally huge responsibility for delivering on people’s expectations. Consequently  my Government has embarked on achieving a digital Bangladesh by implementing its Vision 2021 election manifesto. Our goal is to transform Bangladesh into “Sonar Bangla” or “Bengal of Gold”  as envisioned by Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.  Despite all odds  Bangladesh is making great strides in its socio-economic development. Education  particularly for girls  is a priority of our Government  receiving the largest single share of our annual budget. Our Government has pledged to ensure 100 per cent student enrolment at the primary level by 2010. Accordingly  primary education has been made free —    09-52586 22  with free books — and compulsory for all children. Provision has been made for free education for girls up to the twelfth grade  and stipends are provided for girls in rural secondary schools.   As for the Millennium Development Goals  Bangladesh has been successful in removing gender disparities in the net enrolment of boys and girls in primary and secondary schools. Our Government is now planning to provide free tuition for girls up through the secondary level.   Since children are our future  our Government runs a food-for-education/cash-for-education programme providing food rations to poor primary school children in rural areas. Our aim is to achieve full literacy by 2014.  Health is another major sector where our Government is striving to make progress. During our last period in power  we formulated a national health policy whose main thrust was to ensure basic health care for all without discrimination. A national strategy for maternal health has also been adopted  which provides quality services for safe motherhood. Regarding infant mortality  our plan is to reduce the infant mortality rate from 54 per thousand live births to 15 per thousand. Our plan is also to extend child immunization programmes to reach 100 per cent of the population during our present term.   During our last period in power  we initiated programmes to establish one community health-care centre for every 6 000 people  in order to bring primary health-care services to people’s homes. Only 4 000 of the first phase of 18 000 could be completed during the period we were in power prior to the changeover of government  and the programme was terminated. We are now reactivating the programme.  Bangladesh is often cited for its social safety programmes. A wide range of safety nets have been put in place  such as cash and food transfer programmes  micro-credit and other special poverty alleviation programmes  and special programmes for minorities  the marginalized  the disabled  the physically challenged and the underprivileged. In our earlier period in power  I had introduced an old age pension  a pension for distressed women  Shanti Nibash or old people’s homes  a Karmasangsthan Bank to provide earnings to unemployed youth through productive job creation  and Ashrayan or homes on Government-owned land for homeless people  as well as sustainable jobs.   An innovative programme instituted by my current Government seeks to provide employment to at least one member of each family. Currently  over a half of our budgetary resources are allocated to reducing the poverty level from 45 per cent to 15 per cent by 2021.  Food security has always been our Government’s prime concern. During our earlier term in power  my Government’s agricultural programmes made Bangladesh self-sufficient in food  for which the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization presented us with its prestigious Ceres Award. After the change in government  Bangladesh returned to being in food deficit. This time around  our Government has adopted a national food policy to ensure sustained food security for all  enhance people’s access to food  particularly for children  women and the elderly  reduce food prices  increase food production by reducing the price of fuel  fertilizer and irrigation  and ensure supply of farm inputs.  On the international level  at the World Summit on Food Security to be held in Rome in November 2009  Bangladesh will be seeking a global agreement for the development of agriculture and the attainment of food self-sufficiency in developing countries  particularly the least developed countries (LDCs). Substantial financial contributions from developed countries  an agreement on sustainable agricultural policies  the transfer of technology  equitable and fair trade rules for food and agricultural products with special preferential treatment for LDCs  and the removal of agricultural subsidies in the developed world will also be sought  in order to address the challenges we face in ensuring the food security critical for advancing our development agenda.  For some time now  climate change has been adversely impacting our low-lying  deltaic  monsoonal country. Although Bangladesh’s own contribution to climate change is negligible  it is one of its worst victims. Erratic floods  cyclones  droughts and earthquakes have been disrupting our agriculture and challenging our water resources  as well as our health  energy and urban planning. In particular  cyclones battering the coastal areas have taken countless lives  and sudden floods have uprooted families by the thousands and continue to do so every year. River bank   23 09-52586  erosion  landslides  soil degradation and deforestation are causing millions of climate-change refugees. They already greatly affect our densely populated cities. It is alarming that a metre’s rise in the sea level would inundate 18 per cent of our land mass  directly impacting 11 per cent of our people. Scientific estimates indicate that  of the 1 billion people expected to be displaced worldwide by 2050 as a result of climate-change factors  one in every 45 people in the world and one in every seven in Bangladesh  would be a victim.  Bangladesh has therefore decided to take some measures immediately. Dredging all major rivers is at the top of the agenda for adaptation to climate change. Capital dredging projects will keep rivers in their natural course  deepen them to hold more water  restrict flooding  reduce flood damage  reclaim inundated arable land and keep them navigable. Maintenance dredging would then ensure the sustained regulated flow of the rivers. With the rise in sea level  the excavated silt could build  raise and fortify embankments  increase green belts and help create elevated flat ground for the homes of the displaced  thereby discouraging them from moving to cities. Meanwhile  14 000 cyclone shelters have been constructed  and more are on the way.   Those activities would obviously entail huge costs. A climate-change trust fund has been established with our own resources  but in order to implement the projects the assistance of the international community is imperative.  Rapid and unplanned urbanization  occupational dislocation and lack of food  water and land security are some of the consequences of climate change. The affected communities would not only lose their homes. They would also stand to lose their identity  nationality and their very existence and  in some cases  their countries. In December this year  we will meet in Copenhagen for the fifteenth session of the Conference of the Parties and  therefore  it is critical that the outcome of the Conference reflect a commitment to assured  adequate and easily accessible funding for adaptation and to affordable  eco-friendly technology transfer to developing countries  particularly to the LDCs  as well as specific commitments to deeper cuts in greenhouse emissions. Bangladesh would  of course  make a strong call at the Conference to consider a new legal regime to protect climate migrants under the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change that ensures the social  cultural and economic rehabilitation of migrants displaced through climate change.  On the vital issue of climate change  the recent bold and courageous proposal of Prime Minister Gordon Brown of the United Kingdom has caught the imagination of States at the forefront of dealing with climate change. Among his proposals  the proposed fund to support the adaptation and mitigation programmes of countries affected by climate change has  in particular  won our support. It could be the beginning of a systematic flow of funds towards improving the adversely changing environmental conditions around the globe. The Copenhagen Conference should seriously consider his proposal. The Conference must also be aware that climate-change mitigation does not restrict the steps taken to alleviate energy poverty  and that the post-2012 agreement should incorporate predictable and legally binding commitments to address the adaptation needs of low-lying coastal States  small island countries and LDCs.  The world is caught in an economic recession  the likes of which has not been seen since the Great Depression of the 1930s. The economically vulnerable countries  such as the LDCs  which are not responsible for the crisis  have become its worst victims. Bangladesh is faced with a sharp reduction in exports  falling prices for primary commodities  declining remittances and a severe credit crunch  leading to the contraction of our economic growth  rising unemployment and poverty.   The crisis is due to years of neglect of equity and justice  including a fundamentally unfair international financial structure that never changed with the needs of the times. The need of the hour is the immediate restructuring of the global financial and economic system. The Bretton Woods institutions  namely  the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund  must accommodate a stronger presence of developing countries  especially the LDCs. Indeed  a voting weight proportionate to share capital has proved unsuited to the Bretton Woods system.  Surely  fiscal stimulus packages would help support global demand and aid recovery. However  liberal trade concessions by developed countries  such as duty- and quota-free market access and trade capacity-building for developing countries  particularly LDCs  would rescue them from dire straits. The early    09-52586 24  conclusion of the Doha Development Round of the World Trade Organization trade negotiations would be an important collective stimulus package for our economies.  It is also the time for the countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to fulfil their official development assistance commitments to contribute 0.7 per cent of their gross national income to developing countries and 0.2 per cent specifically to the least developed countries by 2010  as reaffirmed in the Brussels Programme of Action.  The economic turmoil has adversely affected employment at the national level and worldwide. The worst affected are the LDCs  both domestically and in terms of employment abroad. Remittances constitute a significant part of their gross domestic income. However  recent restrictions on new admissions of migrant workers and  even worse  their repatriation to their home countries have resulted in socio-economic instability in many countries. Therefore  recovery measures should be designed in such a manner so as not to adversely affect employment opportunities of immigrant workers from developing countries.  Bangladesh is proud of its outstanding role as a major troop-contributing country serving the United Nations in maintaining peace and security worldwide. Since 1988  Bangladesh has been involved in 32 United Nations peacekeeping operations in 24 different countries  contributing approximately 83 000 personnel. Today  Bangladesh is ranked second with 9 567 peacekeepers serving in various United Nations missions.  With pride I say that  throughout the years  84 of our valiant peacekeepers have laid down their lives for the cause of peace under the auspices of the United Nations. Sadly  despite our contributions and sacrifices  Bangladesh does not have proportionate representation in the Department of Peacekeeping Operations  nor does it have a say in the planning and strategy design of peacekeeping missions. Indeed  this situation calls for rectification on the basis of proportional representation in all fairness.   As a peaceful nation involved in United Nations peacekeeping efforts  Bangladesh is naturally opposed to terrorism. Bangladesh is a party to all terrorism-related United Nations Conventions  which is a testament to our commitment to fighting that scourge. We categorically reject the claims of those who cloak themselves in the rhetoric of Islam or any other faith to justify violence. Nationwide  we have taken stern measures against militant groups and their leaders. We are firmly opposed to violence and terrorism; instead  we promote peace across the world. Bangladesh  in sessions of the General Assembly  has spearheaded the flagship resolution on the culture of peace. At last year’s session of the General Assembly  the resolution was sponsored by 124 nations.   The International Mother Language Day was adopted by UNESCO  at the initiative of Bangladesh  in recognition of 21 February 1952  when language martyrs died for their mother tongue Bangla. Now every year on that day UNESCO celebrates all languages of the world. The Bangla language is spoken by over 250 million people worldwide  primarily in Bangladesh and the Indian state of West Bengal. The Bangladesh Parliament therefore recently adopted a resolution requesting the United Nations to declare Bangla as one of its official languages. Given the rich heritage of the Bangla language and its singular place as a symbol of people’s faith in the power of languages to sustain cultures and indeed the identity of nations  I seek the support of the membership of the United Nations General Assembly for its acceptance as an official language of the United Nations.  At present we are witnessing a rapidly changing world as a result of climate change  economic turmoil and terrorism. It is crystal clear to those who wish to open their eyes that we all belong to a global village where we must live and work together. I therefore call upon all States to discard short-sighted discords and adopt a common resolve in facing today’s grim challenges. Let us share each other’s responsibilities  burdens and prosperity. After all  at stake is our common and shared future. In reaching out to one another  we will leave a harmonious world for our children and future generations thereafter.  May Bangladesh live forever! Long live the United Nations!  The Acting President: On behalf of the General Assembly  I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh for the statement she has just made."
"17",690,"BGR",64,2009,"I am deeply honoured to address this audience on behalf of the Republic of Bulgaria. I would like to convey my delegation’s congratulations to Mr. Ali Treki on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session  and wish him success in the months ahead.  Our gratitude goes to Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann for his leadership and guidance during the previous session. Let me also thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his resolute efforts to promote the United Nations and its values.  Bulgaria fully aligns itself with the statement made by the Prime Minister of Sweden  Mr. Fredrik Reinfeldt  on behalf of the European Union.  Furthermore  Bulgaria would like to express its pleasure at the election of Ambassador Irina Bokova as the new Director-General of UNESCO. We would like to thank all Member States for the trust invested in our candidate. Bulgaria takes great pride in having such a high-level representative in the United Nations system and would like to assure the Assembly that our Government will continue to do everything it can to foster the policies and ideals of UNESCO.  As a member of the European Union (EU)  Bulgaria is dedicated to the spirit of multilateralism and therefore fully supports the efforts to strengthen the United Nations capacity to deliver effective international responses to global challenges.  The most pressing issues that require our attention are undoubtedly the global economic and financial crisis and the negative impact of climate change. In this light  we particularly appreciate the Secretary-General’s initiative to convene the United Nations Summit on Climate Change on 22 September. Furthermore  I would like to express our support for the statement made by the President of France at this general debate. We are indeed running out of time  and if we want to reach an agreement in Copenhagen  timely action is needed.  In the globalized world of the twenty-first century  my country strongly reiterates its full commitment to the principle of effective multilateralism based on international law  the United Nations Charter and the United Nations system  which place the human being and human security  rights and dignity at the very centre of international politics.  Bulgaria considers cooperation in South-East Europe and the Black Sea region to be a priority of its foreign policy. Situated at a particular geographic crossroads  Bulgaria is in a unique position to assess the areas’ pressing issues in their complexity. Together with our partners in the EU and NATO  Bulgaria is proactively cooperating with its immediate neighbours.  Bulgaria strongly affirms that regional cooperation is an integral part of European integration of the western Balkans. It contributes to the strengthening of confidence  stability  security and the affirmation of European standards in the region. To this end  Bulgaria is committed to pursuing efforts aimed at combating and preventing the use of hate speech likely to create fears and tensions between groups from different ethnic  national  religious or social backgrounds.  We therefore call for full compliance with human rights and fundamental freedoms in the western Balkans. In this context  Bulgaria believes that the building of a stable  peaceful  democratic and multi-ethnic Kosovo  living in peace with its   31 09-52592  neighbours  is of primary importance to the security architecture of the western Balkans and Europe as a whole.  Bulgaria is particularly interested in the peaceful long-term development of the Black Sea region. Despite active cooperation among countries in the region  much of its potential has so far not been utilized sufficiently. In this light  it must be said that the South Caucasus remains a region of concern for Bulgaria. We call upon the parties involved to overcome their differences and to engage in a dialogue to ensure the peaceful and prosperous development of the entire Caucasus.  Today  it is our task not only to respond to the challenges  but also to embrace the opportunities that the Black Sea region provides. Bulgaria believes that the strong Eastern dimension of the European Neighbourhood Policy addresses the needs and priorities of all the partners. We see opportunities for launching projects in important sectors  such as transport  trade  energy  environmental protection and border security. My country is one of the main supporters of the Black Sea Synergy initiative  which serves as an inclusive cooperation platform between the European Union and the countries of the wider Black Sea region. Bulgaria will endeavour to contribute to the success of those policies  in particular through its forthcoming chairmanship of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation Organization.  Bulgaria would  furthermore  like to thank the United States and our partners in the European Union for the constructive part they have played in both the Balkan and the Black Sea regions. We are grateful for their counsel and support  and we very much look forward to further deepening and intensifying our cooperation.  The list of persistent grave risks and challenges to global security is  regrettably  not a short one. We are convinced of the need to step up efforts aimed at achieving progress in the areas of international disarmament  arms control and non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. In this regard  the need for the full and universal implementation of the Non-Proliferation Treaty regime remains of utmost importance  and my country is dedicated to supporting a successful outcome of the 2010 Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference.  We are deeply concerned by the recent turn of events regarding Iran’s nuclear dossier  and  in this respect  we strongly appeal to the Iranian authorities to comply with relevant resolutions of the Security Council and to provide their full cooperation to the International Atomic Energy Agency. Bulgaria hopes that the forthcoming negotiations between Iran and the five permanent members of the Security Council plus Germany (P5+1)  scheduled for the beginning of October  will make it possible to renew the discussion on the Iranian nuclear programme and pave the way for a comprehensive solution before December this year.  Bulgaria confirms its position that further reform of the main United Nations bodies is necessary. We believe it is desirable to enhance the transparency and effectiveness of the system. Furthermore  we need only recall the enormous challenges facing Member States and the international community in the twenty-first century world to see the need to reform the United Nations.  Reform of the Security Council should certainly be a central element in any reform of the United Nations. We would like to reiterate our position that both categories of membership on the Council need to be enlarged. Furthermore  we believe that the regional Group of Eastern European States should be allocated at least one additional non-permanent seat.  Bulgaria is well aware of the need to pursue international diplomacy in order to overcome existing conflicts. As a consequence  we welcome the positive role that the European Union plays as a mediator in numerous conflict areas around the world. One such area is the Middle East. Bulgaria firmly supports the efforts of the members of the Quartet in the Middle East peace process and believes that re-establishing direct dialogue between the Israeli and Palestinian delegations is of fundamental importance. Bulgaria firmly supports the position of the European Union in this regard and underlines the fact that a comprehensive and lasting peace can only be realized if the Israeli and Palestinian peoples can live peacefully  side by side  each in its own sovereign State and in mutual recognition.  Another area where the United Nations  supported by the European Union  has an enormous potential to be a force for peace and stability is in Afghanistan. Bulgaria believes that  overall  a more comprehensive and coordinated approach in    09-52592 32  Afghanistan is desirable. In this light  the Bulgarian Government thanks the Swedish presidency of the European Union for preparing a blue book listing all European efforts in Afghanistan with the aim of helping improve coordination on the ground.  Together with our European Union partners  Bulgaria is strongly committed to the cause of human rights. As such  Bulgaria will continue to clearly condemn all such violations of human rights as torture  slavery  sexual abuse and female genital mutilation. Additionally  in this light  we support the call by the Swedish presidency of the European Union for greater empowerment of women and gender equality. Furthermore  we appreciate the Secretary-General’s report entitled “Implementation of the responsibility to protect” of January 2009 (A/63/677) as an important and timely document  and we state our firm interest in further discussing and elaborating on the concept. We hope that  with the recent adoption of resolution 63/308  this concept will be implemented.  In the course of the past year  the world has faced multiple challenges related to the global economic and financial crisis. This crisis has had a huge impact on virtually all sectors of our economy. Bulgaria firmly believes that we can only overcome the crisis through the joint efforts of all relevant actors. We are all in the same boat  and we must all ensure that the lessons of our past mistakes are learned and remembered. To that end  we call for further intensification of the cooperation between developing and developed countries. Additional support should be provided to developing countries in order to avoid further aggravation of global poverty and hunger. More broadly  we are more concerned that the global recession might lead to a decrease in the total level of official development assistance. Greater attention should therefore be paid to the conclusions put forward in the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness of 2005 and the Accra Agenda for Action of 2008. Furthermore  while we are well aware of our financial constraints  Bulgaria  as a country that only recently emerged from the status of a recipient of foreign aid  is committed to live up to its international responsibilities and is determined to be a force for peace and stability.  It is true that the efforts of the United Nations for peace  stability and development constitute an impressive list of achievements. It is also true that a lot more could and should be achieved this year and in the years to come. At the end of the day  however  the achievements of the United Nations depend on what we  the Member States  are willing to do. We have a shared responsibility for the future of our planet. Only through open and honest cooperation can we be successful in overcoming the challenges ahead.  So let us work together  demonstrate beyond any doubt our goodwill  flexibility and commitment  and make this sixty-fourth session of the General Assembly a real success."
"18",735,"BHR",64,2009,"With great pleasure I extend heartfelt congratulations to my brother  His Excellency Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki  Secretary of African Union Affairs of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya  on his unanimous election to the high office of President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. His extensive diplomatic experience and intimate knowledge of the United Nations will undoubtedly enable him to conduct the work of this session with great effectiveness.  I wish also to put on record my appreciation for the efforts of the former President of the General Assembly  Father Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann of Nicaragua  for his able stewardship of the sixty-third session of the General Assembly and for the many enlightened proposals he made during his tenure to enhance and develop the Organization.  My highest appreciation also goes to the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  for his tireless efforts to enhance the purposes and principles of the Charter and to promote the role of the Organization and enhance its efficiency in coping with new developments and responding to the emerging needs of our peoples.  Our belief in open-mindedness  tolerance  diversity  non-violence and rejection of extremism requires us first to free our minds of egoism and prejudice in order to replace conflict with dialogue  disagreements with consensus and violence with persuasion  thus broadening our alliances and outreach efforts. We must exert greater efforts to show tolerance towards those who do not necessarily share our values and ideas. Indeed  certain philosophical or argumentative issues can be tackled and resolved only if each party is open to the other  willing to coexist with the other and ready to resist preconceived ideas and stereotypes. The presence of common ground and of mutual understanding can help to create a more progressive and creative world and hence more secure  based on tolerance  constructive dialogue and human coexistence.   While the world has become a small village as distances have been effectively abolished thanks to technological advances and the communications revolution that has erased barriers and frontiers  it is still dominated by political antagonisms  as States continue to pursue conflicting individual interests. This requires us all to design pragmatic strategies for the future that safeguard everyone’s interests. That can be achieved only through mindsets capable of assimilating these transformations and processing them to serve humanity and to ensure international security and stability.   It is clear that global security cannot be achieved through the sole efforts of the super-Powers  because the challenges we face are more serious  daunting and more widespread than ever before. This requires a broader global alliance of United Nations Member States as well as the support of the entire United Nations system in the interest of the international community as a whole. At the same time  it requires national strategies to address the challenges  problems and issues through close and sustained coordination among nations. The task that burdens us today requires that we discuss all the issues threatening our world  while taking into account the historical background and the particular values  ideas and traditions of our respective societies. At the same time  each party must be ready to understand and appreciate the positions and characteristics of the other and be ready to collectively fight hatred and prejudice.  The Kingdom of Bahrain has always been a melting pot of diverse civilizations  cultures  religions and races and since time immemorial has adopted the concept of tolerance and openness towards the other and coexistence; thus  we firmly believe that finding common ground between universal civilizations and cultures and building a culture of peace among peoples is necessary. In that context  the peaceful settlement of conflicts is deeply rooted in our values and our traditions  which are guided by the principles of our Islamic faith.   The Arab-Israeli conflict of the past six decades has had a great effect on our generation. It is a sad legacy that has left behind misery and human suffering  poisoned international and regional relations and continues periodically to exacerbates tension  violence and military confrontation in the Middle East. We have tried repeatedly and in vain to find a solution to this chronic conflict. To be sure  one conference after another has been held  and initiative has followed initiative. But we have been unable to deliver our message to the minds  hearts and homes of the people of the region. That is the essence of the proposal that His Highness Shaikh Salman bin Hamad Al-Khalifa  Crown Prince of the Kingdom of Bahrain  presented in his article published in The Washington Post on    09-52598 14  16 July  which makes a meaningful contribution to the adoption of a pragmatic approach to ending the conflict. His Highness wrote:  “Our biggest mistake has been to assume that you can simply switch peace on like a light bulb. The reality is that peace is a process  contingent on a good idea but also requiring a great deal of campaigning — patiently and repeatedly targeting all relevant parties.” Careful examination of this argument reveals the correct approach to addressing the Arab-Israeli conflict  namely  directly and expeditiously communicating our Arab Peace Initiative to the Israeli people through their own information and news media. In so doing  we will be in a better position to explore the path to peace.  Today  wisdom requires that we use available communications and media technology prudently and with awareness in order to establish the channels and structures that will enable us as leaders  Governments and civil society to establish the will and momentum necessary to create an environment conducive to advancing the peace that we aspire to. Because today  dialogue has become an omnipresent issue on the global agenda of the United Nations and other international forums  as shown by the many ongoing dialogues  including the dialogue among civilizations  dialogue of cultures and the interfaith dialogue. All these processes aim at enhancing peaceful coexistence between nations and peoples and represent the principal course of action to eliminate the causes of conflict  tension and discord. The Middle East peace process requires that we all exert greater political and diplomatic efforts in order to achieve the two-State solution — Israel and Palestine — as part of a comprehensive and just settlement based on equal security for all the nations of the Middle East region. We believe that the failure to end this conflict is due simply to the lack of a methodology based on justice and balance and to the absence of a binding implementation mechanism. We are all aware that the Arab side went to great lengths to make it clear that it supports peace as an irreversible strategic option.   The Arab Peace Initiative unequivocally confirmed that position. We therefore expect the international community  and particularly the most influential leading Powers  to exert effective pressure on Israel to freeze and eventually dismantle all settlements established in the territories occupied in 1967  to ensure demarcation of the borders of the Palestinian State with Jerusalem as its capital  peacefully coexisting with Israel  and to withdraw from all the occupied Syrian Golan and Lebanese territories  in conformity with the relevant resolutions of international legitimacy and the requirements of the Road Map and the Arab Peace Initiative.  Here I would like to commend the speech of President Barack Obama  delivered from this very rostrum  which we consider a frame of reference for the resumption of the Middle East peace process. President Obama explicitly affirmed the need to relaunch negotiations on final status issues — notably  security for both Israelis and Palestinians  boundaries  refugees and Jerusalem — rejected the continued illegitimate Israeli settlement activity in Palestinian territories and called for the creation of a contiguous and viable Palestinian State.  Among the other challenges and concerns confronting our region is the question of nuclear proliferation in the Middle East and the Gulf region. The Iranian nuclear programme is undoubtedly among the causes for this common concern; nonetheless  it should be dealt with in such a way as to spare our region the threat of confrontation. This can best be achieved through diplomatic means. It is in that spirit that the Kingdom of Bahrain  pursuant to Security Council resolution 1887 (2009)  renews its call on the international community to actively work towards making the Middle East  including the Gulf region  a zone free of nuclear weapons and all other weapons of mass destruction  thus ensuring the security and well-being of the peoples of the region and the world at large  and to call upon Israel to accede to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in order to achieve its universality. All nuclear facilities and activities in the Middle East should be placed under International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards  while acknowledging the legitimate right of States to possess nuclear technology for peaceful uses in the areas where it has become vital for development and the diversification of energy sources  in conformity with relevant international agreements.   15 09-52598   Other important regional issues are also a matter of concern to us. Foremost among these is the situation in brotherly Iraq  whose sovereignty and territorial integrity it is important to affirm  while not interfering in its internal affairs. We should also condemn all terrorist activities perpetrated against Iraq with a view to destabilizing its security and rekindling sectarian hatred there.  Also  in order to build confidence between the Member States of the Gulf Cooperation Council and Iran  it is imperative to reach a settlement on the question of the occupied islands belonging to the United Arab Emirates  through either direct negotiations or referral to the International Court of Justice. We also reaffirm the need for joint international and regional efforts to assist brotherly Yemen  under the supervision of the United Nations  in coping with the heavy refugee burden and focusing on its development efforts and the restoration of security and stability throughout its territory. Similarly  we stress the importance of preserving peace  stability and unity in the brotherly Sudan and we look forward to the cooperation of all relevant parties to resolve the Darfur issue and to achieve the desired peace.  We urge the international community to shoulder its responsibilities regarding security in Somalia  whose internal troubles and fragile central Government have led to the spread of maritime piracy in the Gulf of Aden and the Bab-el-Mandeb strait  much to the detriment of international navigation and trade. Also  the Kingdom of Bahrain once again reaffirms its consistent position concerning the sovereignty of the brotherly Kingdom of Morocco over the its entire national territory and calls on the international community to support the negotiation process initiated by the Security Council  to maintain its momentum and activate it.  With peace and development the twin concerns of our world  it is only natural to feel frustration in the face of the prevailing environmental degradation  pandemics  desertification  poverty  water scarcity  depletion of the ozone layer  climate change and the world financial crisis. These challenges represent an imminent threat both to our life now and to that of future generations. It is therefore no overstatement to say that in the twenty-first century our destinies are intertwined  and that we need to redouble our collective efforts to address these universal dangers that daily threaten humanity and its health  food and security.  In this regard  the Kingdom of Bahrain  in cooperation with the United Nations and in the presence of the Secretary-General  hosted in May the launch of the 2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction. The report deals with issues pertaining to the protection of lives and property in natural disaster situations related to global warming  earthquakes  floods and rising sea levels. We hope that the major industrial countries will play a key role in forging an agreement at December’s Copenhagen Climate Change Conference  with a view to curbing harmful greenhouse gas emissions. It is our hope that the necessary political will can be mustered to respond to this threat to humanity and to make our world safer and more sustainable.  In this context  the Kingdom of Bahrain  in its capacity as a small island developing State  wishes to express great concern at the evident causal relation between climate change and rising sea levels  which poses a serious threat to our world. We are in agreement with the other small island developing States in their concern over the adverse impact of the increase in average global temperature.  In conclusion  the gravity that characterizes our present session  as exemplified by the responsible discussions in the first week  notably at the  22 September Summit on Climate Change and the  24 September Security Council summit (see S/PV.6181)  reconfirms our need to return to the spirit of the Charter: that the United Nations is the principal forum for multilateral cooperation to address a wide range of contemporary issues. The United Nations as an institution is not limited merely to the maintenance of international peace and security. Rather  it is the principal forum for the coordination of positions and efforts aimed at addressing the challenges threatening human beings and their environment  alleviating poverty  controlling pandemics and settling conflicts and wars through dialogue  negotiations and other peaceful means in a world guided by tolerance  peaceful coexistence and security for current and future generations."
"19",773,"BHS",64,2009,"On behalf of the Government and people of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas  I convey my sincere congratulations on Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki’s election to preside over the   47 09-52470  General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. My delegation wishes to assure him of its full cooperation and support throughout this session. I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate his predecessor  Father Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann  on his stewardship of the sixty-third session.  The current global financial and economic crisis  possibly the worst since the Great Depression  threatens to negate all that we have achieved thus far on our development agenda  at both the national and the international levels. This threat was acknowledged at the High-Level Event on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in September 2008. The scenario is no better today.  The fallout for the Bahamas has been considerable. Ours is a very small  open economy that is closely linked to the performance of most developed economies. Tourism matters in the Bahamas; it is our primary industry and it affects all aspects of economic life in our country. We are in the midst of arguably one of the most difficult tourism seasons on record. Visitor arrivals are down  hotel occupancies are down and revenues earned from tourism are down. Unemployment has sharply increased. The continued economic uncertainty means that unemployment will pose a problem until the global economy is stabilized and returns to growth. In this regard  we are heartened by some of the signs of global economic recovery.  The Government of the Bahamas acted quickly to soften the impact of the international economic downturn on our population. We took appropriate steps to ensure the continued integrity of our domestic fiscal and financial system; we accelerated planned capital works to generate employment and economic activity; and we increased targeted social relief for those most disadvantaged by the crisis. In implementing these policies and programmes  the Government exercised appropriate fiscal restraint  so as to ensure sustainability in the long term as well as the medium term and to encourage and ensure that the economy would be well placed to respond swiftly to any upturn in the global economy. The Bahamas believes that it is critically important to global financial health that actions taken at the national level be complemented by appropriate international responses.  This year the General Assembly will consider the scale of assessments for the apportionment of the expenses of the United Nations for the period 2010-2012  as well as the scale of assessments for the apportionment of the expenses of United Nations peacekeeping operations. The Bahamas takes this opportunity to reiterate its long-standing position that per capita gross national income (GNI) should not be given undue weight in determining capacity to pay  as it often leads to distortions. Nowhere is this distortion more visible than in the case of the scale of assessments for peacekeeping operations. The current scales place the Bahamas  a small developing island nation  in the same category as the most developed economies in the world  with the exception of the permanent members of the Security Council. This unjust formula creates an onerous burden  and we call upon this body to address the inequity  which seriously undermines the development objectives of the Bahamas  as well as other developing countries.  Clearly the GNI criterion does not properly reflect either the vulnerability of our economy or the extraordinary costs associated with the duplication of infrastructure required by our archipelagic configuration. Yet  despite our vulnerabilities  we have never wavered in our responsibilities as a fully fledged member of the international community and will continue to meet our obligations to the United Nations in the manner prescribed and agreed. While my Government is committed to paying its assessed contributions in a full and timely manner  we believe that the proposed scale of assessments is unfair and unduly burdensome to countries such as the Bahamas  and should therefore be reconsidered and adjusted  taking into account those considerations that reflect our vulnerabilities.  Climate change presents acute challenges for small island developing States such as the Bahamas  and we are certainly vulnerable to its impact. One of the major consequences of climate change for the Bahamas has been the increase in the number  frequency and ferocity of the hurricanes affecting our country and region over the last two decades. Restoration and recovery efforts required as a result of these extreme events have taken a toll amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars over the past decade alone  diverting scarce resources from other critically important national development programmes and compromising our efforts at sustainable development.  Hence  we have a special interest not only in actions taken to mitigate the adverse impacts of climate change but also in measures designed to slow —    09-52470 48  indeed  to reverse — actions that negatively affect climate. As a founding member of the Alliance of Small Island States  the Bahamas has joined with many like-minded States in our region and around the world in calling for a global agreement in Copenhagen  with legally binding targets  that will permit us to achieve the ultimate objectives of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.  The Bahamas is cognizant that the responsibility for climate change does not rest with developed countries alone. Within our limited capabilities  we have undertaken a number of appropriate actions  highlighted during the High-Level Event  in order to increase our resistance to the adverse impacts of climate change. But it is also important that initiatives undertaken in the quest for environmental protection do not cause greater harm than good. For example  the introduction of an air-passenger levy will damage our already weakened tourism industry  the industry that is our economic lifeline. The proposed marine bunkering levies or taxes are likely to have a similar negative impact on our maritime registry’s cost competitiveness. Such supposedly well-intentioned environmental initiatives come at a time when resources available for adaptation are not readily available to small island developing States like the Bahamas.  As an archipelagic nation  the Bahamas faces particular challenges in the area of maritime safety and security. My Government has committed tremendous financial and technical resources to combat illicit trafficking of drugs and weapons; illegal  unreported and unregulated fishing and human smuggling  and underscores the need for effective cooperation and coordination among States  as well as the development of innovative approaches to resolve those issues and complement national efforts. The Bahamas welcomes the constructive engagement of the United Nations and the International Maritime Organization in addressing the issue of piracy. As the country with the world’s third largest ship registry  the Bahamas will continue to engage with its partners in the international community to ensure the safety and security of international shipping.  Haiti is a near neighbour and a member of our Caribbean Community (CARICOM). The Bahamas and the Caribbean Community States are committed to Haiti’s stabilization and to its political and economic development in the short and long terms. This cannot be achieved without sustained support from the international community. The Bahamas is therefore heartened by the United Nations active and sustained engagement in Haiti over the past four and a half years  through the work of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti. We share the hope of the Secretary-General that Haiti is moving away from a history of conflict towards a future of peaceful and sustainable development.  We call on the Security Council to further extend the mandate of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti beyond 15 October 2009  as recommended by the Secretary-General. We are also hopeful that the recent appointment of former United States President Bill Clinton as the Secretary-General’s Special Envoy for Haiti will help to keep the issues affecting Haiti at the forefront of the agenda of the national and international community. The Security Council meeting on Haiti earlier this month was certainly most welcome in this regard.  An increased level of criminal activity is creating new challenges for the Bahamas — a phenomenon shared with other countries in our region. We continue to implement national and regional anti-crime initiatives to combat this scourge  which undermines our economies and  indeed  affects our social stability.  Illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs and small arms and light weapons are major contributing factors to this phenomenon. The Bahamas — as many are aware — is not a producer of illicit drugs; neither the Bahamas nor the other States members of CARICOM are manufacturers or suppliers of small arms and light weapons. Yet  illicit drugs and light weapons account overwhelmingly for the amount of crime in our societies. A disproportionate amount of our scarce budgetary resources are dedicated to fighting illicit drug and light arms trafficking through our territory and in dealing with the terrible fallout in our communities.  The Bahamas is fully committed to enhancing regional and international cooperation in the area of peace and security. We are pleased that the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime has agreed to re-engage with the Caribbean region to support the fight against the crime and violence that today mar our societies.  In closing  my delegation wishes to state that the current economic crisis dramatically demonstrates the interdependence of the economies of the world. This in   49 09-52470  turn shows the critically important role which organizations like the United Nations can play in facilitating dialogue and crafting creative solutions to global problems. As we continue to face these unprecedented global challenges  the Bahamas reaffirms its commitment to engaging fully and constructively with its partners in the international community to find collective solutions to the challenges which confront all of us."
"20",798,"BIH",64,2009,"It is a great honour for me to address the General Assembly today in my capacity as the Chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina. At the very outset  allow me to congratulate the President of the Assembly at its sixty-fourth session and the other members of the Bureau on their election  and to express our full support to their future work. Furthermore  I would like to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann  whom I met on several occasions  on the results achieved during his presidency of the sixty-third session of the General Assembly at a time when this body and the international community in general were facing an array of challenges related to pressing global issues.   Sessions of the General Assembly have always served as opportunities for leaders of States to gather and exchange their opinions about the situation in the world with the aim of finding the most suitable solutions for current global issues. The United Nations  like other organizations  depends upon the collective strength of its Members; that strength needs to be based on consensus among Member States. One of the most pressing issues that has marked the past year is the global economic and financial crisis  which has become the biggest threat to global peace and stability. If we miss the opportunity to tackle its negative effects immediately  it could produce unimaginable consequences throughout the world.  Even though there are indicators which show that recession in developed countries is slowly abating  it is evident that recovery will be slow and time-consuming. With regard to the developing and less developed countries  we can only imagine the harmful consequences that this crisis could produce in the times ahead. It is more than obvious that countries cannot combat these crises on their own  regardless of the efficiency of their Governments. Global crisis requires global solutions.   Ms. Koirala (Nepal)  Vice-President  took the Chair.  We welcome the adoption of the outcome document of the recent high-level Conference on the World Financial and Economic Crisis and Its Impact on Development (resolution 63/303  annex). The Conference confirmed once again that the role of the United Nations — and especially of the General   7 09-52320  Assembly  as one of the most democratic of forums — is to lead this process and find new modalities for improvement of cooperation with the aim of establishing effective mechanisms for preventing crises and alleviating and eliminating their consequences  as well as for eradicating poverty and establishing social justice in the world.  It is accurate to say that the present global economic crisis — the severest since the establishment of the United Nations — has heavily compromised and even jeopardized the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals  one of the noblest tasks set by the Organization since its foundation. This applies in particular to the poorest countries  and especially to sub-Saharan African countries that had failed to achieve positive results even before the onset of the crisis. I stress that besides the responsibility borne by those countries pertaining to their activities in establishing good governance and the rule of law  which are prerequisites for achieving the aforementioned development goals  a huge responsibility lies with the developed countries.  It is exactly the developed countries that are expected to do everything in their power in order to overcome the global economic crisis. We think that during the crisis it is necessary to reform the global financial system and make it more transparent  to develop mechanisms for market monitoring and thus to avoid the mistakes that occurred in the period prior to the current decrease in the global GDP.   State institutions in my country — Bosnia and Herzegovina — have made systematic efforts to accomplish the Millennium Development Goals  and we believe that other than the difficulties caused by global economic volatility  there possibly will be no other obstacles in the context of finalizing the defined tasks by 2015. At the moment  Bosnia and Herzegovina is preparing a development strategy and a social inclusion strategy. The anti-poverty strategy was drafted earlier and has been implemented. Such projects have been carried out in cooperation with relevant United Nations agencies in Bosnia and Herzegovina  and I wish to take this opportunity to express my gratitude for that intensive cooperation.  Climate change is one of the key issues that require an urgent response from the international community. Bosnia and Herzegovina aspires to end the year 2009 with successful completion of international negotiations on climate change. Furthermore  we hope that the Copenhagen summit will produce an agreement that outpaces the Kyoto Protocol and that it will gain the support of the United Nations Member States.   However  it is not only island countries that are affected by this problem. It is a universal challenge and threat. Humanitarian catastrophes caused by weather conditions that have affected parts of our planet over recent years should serve as a warning to all of us. Neither economic nor political interests must be allowed to obstruct the achievement of a global consensus as the true beginning of a global struggle to prevent the loss of the natural balance of our planet.  All of us gathered here today agree that consensus and comprehensive reform of the United Nations system is necessary and that it ought to be carried out in a careful  prudent manner that ensures the broadest consensus of the Member States. United Nations reform should result in efficient and coordinated functioning of all bodies of the system. However  a widely accepted perspective is that the reform of the Security Council is of key importance for substantive reform of the entire system of the world organization.   I am convinced that the majority agree with me that Security Council reform ought primarily to result in better transparency of that body and its activities and should provide for a considerably larger spectrum of non-member States to participate in its work. That applies in particular to countries that are most on the Council’s agenda  countries that are directly affected by a particular crisis  as well as countries that could use their expertise or experience gained in similar situations that contribute to following the best and most acceptable solutions.  We all have to be aware that any further delay in Security Council reform will undermine the credibility of that body  whereas the willingness to reach a compromise must be an imperative. Dialogue and compromise are the only way to ensure the broadest possible support for reforms.   Bosnia and Herzegovina is of the opinion that Security Council reform should urgently commence. In any case  we believe that in the future reformed Council  the group of Eastern European countries must have another non-permanent seat  considering that the   09-52320 8  number of countries in that group has more than doubled in the last two decades.  I wish to emphasize that I expect the Council to engage more strongly in preventive diplomacy. We believe that taking that new course of action would mean that many issues and crises could be solved before they become aggravated  thus increasing the Council’s efficiency. Ensuring timely and efficient conflict prevention  rather than reacting once a crisis has already escalated  is a more efficient and less expensive method for preserving peace and security.  Unfortunately  armed conflicts remain the reality of our world  and those most in danger are the poorest peoples and nations  who are left to fend for themselves. Therefore  it is necessary to foster additional United Nations early warning mechanisms and establish multiple sources of information in order to create a true picture of the situation and at the same time strengthen countries’ abilities to resist enticements that lead to genocide  war crimes  ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity.  Bosnia and Herzegovina remains committed to full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia  since those indicted for war crimes in the former Yugoslavia must be prosecuted. Meanwhile  a legal framework has been set up in Bosnia and Herzegovina  and the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina has begun to prosecute war crimes. That is one of the requirements for building mutual confidence and reconciliation in post-conflict Bosnia and Herzegovina.  The number of refugees has been growing daily around the globe  but less effort and fewer means are devoted to finding a concrete solution to this global issue. We in Bosnia and Herzegovina are well acquainted with the destiny  pain and suffering of refugees  and thus we urge maximum effort to systematically resolve the global refugee crises. We support the joint and continued endeavours of all United Nations agencies and the non-governmental sector that directly deal with this problem. We are willing to offer cooperation in every aspect.  With regard to United Nations peacekeeping missions  we believe that  with foresight and considering the best practices  each crisis has to be carefully examined  taking into consideration all its causes  if we are to find a sustainable and justifiable solution. We believe that there are no universal solutions applicable to every crisis  to the requirements of each particular case.  Various cultures and traditions have coexisted in the Balkans for centuries. We are willing to share both our positive and negative experiences in the post-conflict peacebuilding aspect.   The foreign policy of Bosnia and Herzegovina is aimed at preserving and improving long-lasting peace  security and stability  democratic and comprehensive social development and contributions to international peace and stability.  The presence  participation and actions of small countries in the decision-making process of the Security Council are of great importance in maintaining balance within the Council. However  apart from the views of the permanent members and world Powers  the Council needs to encourage smaller countries to present their views and participate in the decision-making process of that body  which in some ways represents global government. That is one of the reasons why we decided  after careful consideration and for the first time in our history  to run for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council for the period 2010-2011. Bosnia and Herzegovina  which has been the main topic of numerous debates of the international community  today wants to have the capacity to actively participate in and contribute to the work of the Security Council.   As a small but multi-ethnic  multinational and multireligious country with a rich historic heritage  Bosnia and Herzegovina is conversant with a plethora of sociopolitical systems and cultural and historical contexts. Bosnia and Herzegovina is willing to share its experience in peacebuilding in a post-conflict situation  particularly in the area of confidence-building among multicultural communities  and thus actively contribute to better understanding and long-term reconciliation in such regions.   Today  Bosnia and Herzegovina actively participates in the work of international organizations  especially the work of the United Nations. It has been a member of the Human Rights Council since June 2007  and within the Council’s framework it has been working on promoting and protecting human rights throughout the world. Since 2000  members of the armed forces and police forces from Bosnia and Herzegovina have been equal participants in United Nations international military and police missions in   9 09-52320  the Democratic Republic of the Congo  Ethiopia  Eritrea  Liberia  Sudan  East Timor  Cyprus and Haiti  thus contributing to the preservation of international peace and stability. Furthermore  it supports international efforts to stabilize the situations in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Finding a solution to the Middle East crisis remains one of the priorities of the world Organization. We believe that positive momentum ought to be used in the best possible manner to establish equitable and comprehensive peace in this region. After so many years of suffering  bloodshed  tension  mutual misunderstanding and conflict  we must support the latest activities of the Quartet members  as well as regional initiatives aimed at taking the crucial step forward leading to sustainable peace  which implies creation of a sovereign  independent and self-sustaining Palestinian State.  Bosnia and Herzegovina has been closely following the situation in Africa. We expect that despite the hard-hitting global economic crisis  the world’s most developed countries will continue to increase the percentage of their gross domestic product that they contribute to official development assistance and to contribute the other expertise necessary for strengthening the capacities of poor African countries. We therefore welcome the efforts by the United Nations through the New Partnership for Africa’s Development intended to lead Africa to stable and sustainable development and to fulfil the Millennium Development Goals.   This particularly relates to sub-Saharan countries. We support the efforts of the African Union  African Governments  the United Nations  the United Nations Office for West Africa and other regional initiatives designed to improve the rule of law and democracy and to strengthen capacities of civil society and institutions  and thus to upgrade all aspects of social life. We underline the importance of the continued provision of material aid for Africa  as well as improved use of these resources towards sustainable development.  Nowadays  when political and social processes are more dynamic than ever and we are facing challenges quite opposite from those of several decades ago  it has become more obvious that only a strong  multilateral approach can provide the right answers. The United Nations has faced numerous challenges  yet it remains the only path leading to a better future and the only Organization able to offer adequate solutions to the array of global issues we are facing. If we work together to implement the conclusions reached here at this high-level event  we will undoubtedly live in better and more equitable conditions than is the case today.  Bosnia and Herzegovina is willing to fully contribute to the work of the United Nations. I would like to express my gratitude to all Member States who supported Bosnia and Herzegovina and who are willing to elect my country as a non-permanent member of the Security Council for the period 2010-2011."
"21",845,"BLR",64,2009,"This General Assembly Hall is  in fact  the situation room of the entire world. It seems to me that over the years we here in this Hall have collectively understood and known what to do. The main thing now is to agree how to do it. We all need an effective tool.  There is hope that we are already close to a common understanding of how and with what tool we can achieve our goals. For the international community to emerge from a series of multiple crises and to overcome multidimensional new threats  we must achieve a policy of partnership. Modern international relations are increasingly being built on the basis of horizontal networks that include all interested and constructive stakeholders in today’s world — States  international organizations  civil society and the private sector. Partnerships are a mechanism of engagement that has no reasonable alternative in the context of a pluralistic and contradictory world.  One particular political factor that raises hope that that approach is a realistic instrument is an emerging meeting of minds — involving various forces on different continents — that see in partnerships a link by which one can extend the chain. By way of illustration  I will cite the example of the call of Belarus  from this rostrum two years ago  for systems based on opposition and confrontation to become new international ones based on engagement and partnership (see A/62/PV.11). A year ago  when opening the sixty-third session of the General Assembly  Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon noted   “Nations can no longer protect their interests or advance the well-being of their peoples without the partnership of other nations.” (A/63/PV.5  p. 1) This year the United States declared its readiness to “build partnerships and solve problems that no nation can solve on its own”. The European Union has also addressed the General Assembly with the same message of cooperation and partnership. The President of Russia spoke from this rostrum about a “collective agenda for unification” () dictated by life itself.  After a long break it seems that the international community is starting to think along the same lines on security  partnership and development and that the world’s political leaders are beginning to speak the same language — that of common sense.  An important proof of the principled readiness to walk the path of partnership is the efforts of the 20 largest world economies to combine their resources to lead the world out of the global economic crisis. We welcome in that connection recent meetings of some regional economic and political groups of States. On a less positive note  it should be noted that some aspects of the agreements reached remain to be carried out by the parties  for example  the rejection and removal of protectionist measures in international trade. It should be said that the Group of Twenty format — let alone the Group of Eight — is too narrow to be considered a representative partnership. In this regard  engaging economic regional groupings of States with significant potential  for example in our region — the Eurasian Economic Community — would make the format more representative.  We also believe there is great potential for dialogue and partnership between the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) and other major centres of power  as was discussed recently at the recent summit of the Non-Aligned Movement in Egypt. After all  today the Movement represents a significant international factor. Its members make tangible contributions to international security and are important actors on the international socio-economic stage.  Today I address my colleagues from the European Union  the United States  Russia and other developed countries and call upon them to show leadership in dealing with the unprecedented global challenges through close partnerships and coordination with all members of the international community  including Belarus. Members of the international community  especially the world’s power centres and leading political groups  should give practical effect to their good intentions by developing global partnerships and crisis strategies.  The greatest potential for responding to global threats and challenges is clearly here in the United Nations. As a founding member of the Organization     09-52592 36  Belarus is convinced of the ability of the United Nations to play a leading role in generating partnerships to overcome the most acute global problems.  Was it not under the aegis of the United Nations that the foundation was laid for the establishment of an anti-terrorism coalition and elaboration of a counter-terrorism strategy after the tragic events of 11 September 2001? And by the way  should the United Nations not consider proclaiming 11 September as the day of the fight against terrorism? We would be interested in hearing States’ reactions to this idea. Have not the achievement of the General Assembly in establishing the New Partnership for Africa’s Development been acknowledged worldwide? The Millennium Development Goals were also formulated in the context of a global partnership for development.  United Nations capacities have been strengthened by some of the progress made in reforming the Organization. In this regard I note  in particular  a new positive element  namely  the thematic debates in the General Assembly.  Bearing in mind the experience and potential of the United Nations  Belarus has proposed the establishment of a global thematic partnership against human trafficking and slavery in the twenty-first century. An informal mechanism on the topic initially took shape at the Global Forum to Fight Human Trafficking in Vienna in February 2008. It must be institutionalized to work effectively — I stress institutionalized  not bureaucratized — through the elaboration and adoption by the General Assembly of a global plan of action to combat human trafficking.  The idea for such a plan garnered wide support in May during the thematic debate in the General Assembly. We have also heard expressions of support from high ranking participants in this general debate. We welcome the recent decision by the President of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session to appoint the Permanent Representatives of Cape Verde and Portugal as facilitators of the consultations on the global plan. We call on all our partners and friends to engage actively in this work.  Global economic development is always driven by certain engines  which are replaced by new and more effective ones. For example  coal and steel were engines for the European industrial revolution; the engine for the global economy after the Second World War was oil  which was replaced by information technologies in the 1990s. The economic engine of the past decade was finance. It is absolutely obvious that the global crisis has demonstrated the need to replace the outdated financial engine. What can and should replace it? We believe there will be not just one engine for the future  but a number of elements that include a leading role for clean  green technologies. Given the increasing interdependence of energy and environment and the determining role of energy in global survival  it cannot be otherwise.  This year we face an especially momentous task: elaboration of new post-Kyoto agreements to deal with global warming that include universal introduction of new and renewable energy sources. This issue was discussed in depth at the thematic dialogue of the General Assembly held in June 2009. That was a good beginning  yet we must move decisively forward. The increasing topicality of the energy and environment agenda requires creation of a specific partnership — a global mechanism to improve the access of developing countries and countries with economies in transition to new and renewable energy sources.  This issue must not be shelved. We need to lay the foundations for a qualitative breakthrough at this session of the General Assembly. Belarus will initiate a comprehensive study of this issue with the involvement of leading international experts and include in its results conclusions and recommendations for the future report of the Secretary-General. We believe that  given current conditions  the strengthening of the economic potential and political role of middle-income countries could be yet another motor of economic and social progress.  Experience has clearly shown that resources and capacities of a narrow circle of traditional world leaders are insufficient for overcoming the crisis. The greatest potential for growth rests with middle-income countries. To a certain extent  one could draw a parallel here with the key role played by the middle class in the stable economic and political development of States. It is no coincidence that the majority of United States and European companies are turning their eyes to the Asian and other developing world markets.  Mindful of such importance  let alone the mere numerical strength of this group of countries  which includes more than 100 States  the United Nations system must take an active role. With this idea in mind   37 09-52592  last year  Belarus  together with its partners  sponsored the adoption by the General Assembly of a resolution on cooperation for development with middle-income countries.  This year  for the first time within these walls  a substantive discussion was held on how to make the best use of the capacity of the United Nations system to assist such countries in addressing their specific social and economic problems  which are particularly important for sustainable global development.  We hope that the work of the General Assembly on that topic will not be seen simply in terms of competition for the scarce resources of the donor community and the United Nations. That is not the point. The larger the number of economically prosperous States in the world  the stronger and more predictable the world economy will be. There will be increased predictability and fewer crises and catastrophes. There will be more opportunities for economic growth in the poorer countries and an increase in international assistance will be generated. In the long run  everyone will be a winner.  I cannot but turn to the subject of Kyoto and post-Kyoto  which sets the tone for the current session of the General Assembly. The possible outcome of the Copenhagen meeting is  unfortunately  not quite clear. All of us  big  medium-size and small States  have to do our utmost to ensure its success. But the perfect does not have to be the enemy of the good.  Belarus is the only State in the world that  for several years  has been trying to achieve what may seem  at first glance  to be a paradoxical goal. That is  to take on significant commitments to reduce harmful emissions. The commitments we have taken happen to be more significant than many of our neighbours  and even than those of some European Union countries.  Since we are all partners here  I will put it in a blunt and straightforward way. We do not understand why many States  including powerful groups of States  which are  by the way  leading the way in post-Kyoto advocacy  do not allow us to assume legally binding and significant Kyoto commitments. I address this call to partners and colleagues. If we want to strengthen the Kyoto paradigm  let us not undermine it. I sincerely hope that the call of Belarus for speedy ratification of our accession to Kyoto will be heeded.  In a year’s time  here in New York  there will be the 2010 United Nations Summit. That is the only forum that has united the heads of State and Government of the G-8  the G-20  the European Union  the Non-Aligned Movement  the Commonwealth of Independent States and others. Belarus proposes considering the 2010 Summit as a summit of partnerships  the venue for putting forward and acting upon the ideas of global partnerships.  We support the intention of the President of the current session of the General Assembly to start preparations for the Summit well in advance. At the Summit itself  we propose the adoption  at the level of heads of State and Government  of a mechanism  an algorithm or a plan of close cooperation on the part of Member States for the years to come on how to overcome global challenges. And in the next few months  delegations could make suggestions as to the substance of such a document. Negotiations on the document could start in January 2010.  Sixty-five years after the signing of the United Nations Charter  we can and should make an honourable attempt to return to the roots of the United Nations by restoring the original meaning of the word “united”  which forms part of our name. It all depends on us. "
"22",880,"BLZ",64,2009,"Please permit me to congratulate Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki  on behalf of the Prime Minister  Government and people of Belize  on having assumed the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session and to wish him every success in his stewardship. Permit me also to extend my Government’s thanks to Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann for his excellent stewardship of the work of the sixty-third session of the General Assembly.  Belize is pleased to discharge its obligation by participating in the general debate of the sixty-fourth regular session of the General Assembly on the theme “Effective responses to global crises: strengthening multilateralism and dialogue among civilizations for international peace  security and development”.  Just over one week ago  we celebrated the twenty-eighth anniversary of our independence. Joining us in the celebrations were members of the diplomatic core drawn from the four corners of the globe. And even as we made merry  our collective minds were silently cogitating upon the crises that are threatening to destroy our collective way of life and  indeed  the very planet which sustains us.  All indications are that the aftershocks of the global economic crisis have now begun to affect Belize’s real economy. We are experiencing declining levels of revenue  a worrying reduction in productivity  diminishing remittances  crushing debt-servicing obligations  unrelenting budgetary pressures and a drying up of resources on which to draw.   These challenges are aggravated by other ills that plague our day-to-day existence. Annually  we are threatened by hurricanes and floods of ever greater intensity  which reduce the yields of our farmers  erode our beaches and wash away vital infrastructure. Warmer seas damage our great barrier reef and impair its capacity to incubate and nurture the fish and other marine organisms that depend upon a healthy reef system for their survival. Illicit traffickers in drugs and arms penetrate our borders at will  leaving drug addicts  broken families  violence  death and destruction in their wake. Our population is also being ravaged by HIV/AIDS. Other non-communicable chronic diseases are approaching pandemic proportions. All these crises have placed the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals in Belize in real jeopardy.  The globalization that was the tide to lift all boats has not been so even. Its networks of interdependence have compounded how we as national Governments can secure the basic needs of our people. Its evolving system of global governance is unresponsive to the cares and concerns of middle-income countries like ours  for despite the devastating impact it is having upon our economies  we are yet to be invited to the table to participate in the discussion on the global economic crisis. Our pleas for an ambitious climate agreement are yet to be honoured with serious contemplation in the current negotiations  although the    09-52598 38  viability of our countries hangs in the balance  and the global commitment of a development-oriented trade round seems to have been perfunctorily relegated to the annals of trade-negotiating history. Our demands  although ceremoniously acknowledged in countless resolutions and declarations  remain unceremoniously unmet.  If we are to define an effective global response to the converging global challenges that confront us  we must first examine how we are governed. While we  as Member States of the United Nations  have endorsed the principle of sovereign equality  it is apparent from the structural relationships engendered in our institutions that the principle is honoured more in the breach than in the observance. The United Nations has its Security Council and the Permanent Five; the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have their weighted voting and the World Trade Organization has its green room. In the larger global arena  we have a proliferation of convenient groupings — the Group of Six  the Group of Seven  the Group of Eight  the Group of Twenty and the Major Economies Forum  to name but a few. The club model of cooperation is deeply entrenched in our multilateral system.  While we cannot deny that this model has facilitated some decisions and agreements  we also cannot ignore the costs associated with that facilitation. This model of global governance has progressively accumulated a debt of trust and confidence among the wider international community not only as a result of its manner of exclusive decision-making  but also because of the lack of implementation of global decisions and agreements. The club model of multilateral cooperation suffers from a crisis of legitimacy.  If we accept that we operate as sovereign equals  we cannot continue to acquiesce to governance by a few. We must accept nothing less than equal representation. In that regard  we recognize and applaud our brothers from the South who have  through their economic prowess and political deftness  taken the mantle of leadership in some international issues. We are all entitled to be heard and  what is more  we are all entitled to have the decisions that are made reflect our concerns if not our demands.  We need a new model for multilateral cooperation framework in which all nations have meaningful input into the decision-making process on issues that have a direct impact on their interests. This requires fundamental structural reform and not mere cursory efforts for technocratic coherence. Given the far-reaching geopolitical consequences that the global economic crisis has touched off  we now have the perfect opportunity to redress the shortcomings of the exclusive club model  thereby restoring trust and confidence in our multilateral institutions. The time for inclusive multilateralism is now upon us.  Allow me to now address some of the issues that bear upon the immediate interests of my people and my country  Belize. Belize falls within the World Bank category of middle-income countries. Middle-income countries play a pivotal role in the global economy and in global politics. We account for some two thirds of the world’s population. Our economies provide important and growing sources of export demand and investment opportunities. Some economies of middle-income countries are now even big enough to create systemic risks in global financial markets. On strategic issues  middle-income countries have not infrequently emerged as key players  and one half of the world’s protected areas are to be found in our countries.   Still  poverty remains prevalent in our countries. Some three quarters of the world’s poor live in middle-income countries. We also account for an estimated 47 per cent of global carbon dioxide emissions.   Given the aforementioned  it is evident that whatever happens in middle-income countries affects the entire world for better or for worse. For this reason  if for no other  it is in the interest of the world community that middle-income countries remain viable  vibrant and dynamic.  In order for that to happen  however  bilateral and multilateral institutions must redefine the terms of engagement with our countries. Rather than focusing on per capita income  a needs-based analysis is necessary. Financing arrangements that tend towards the short and medium term must also be revisited. In order to build capacity  improve our institutions and spur economic growth  we need direct fiscal and budgetary support. Moreover  in view of the high ratio of debt-to-gross-domestic-product (GDP) in many of our countries  which has been further exacerbated by the recent global economic crisis  the need for concessionary financing and debt relief is ever more critical.   39 09-52598   During the 1980s and 1990s  the integration of markets spurred significant growth in high-income nations  while low-income nations exploited their comparative advantage in cheap labour. However  middle-income countries had neither advantage in knowledge nor low-wage products and consequently  in real terms  experienced economic stagnation. Many of us were forced to embark upon a process of diversification to ensure our continued growth and development.  Therefore  in the early 1990s  Belize made rapid strides in building up its international financial services industry. We did so in accordance with the best practices of the industry internationally  and we were guided every step of the way by the recommendations of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). As a country whose GDP is just over $1 billion  the contribution of this industry to our economy is significant. A large percentage of the deposits from the international banking sector has been used to finance development projects  support our citrus industry and commercial free zone and export processing zone businesses  which account for some $1 billion worth of investments in our country.   Furthermore  since this sector finances only foreign exchange earning businesses  it enables the generation of millions of dollars in foreign exchange that directly supports our fixed exchange rate system. It is also a source for the creation of relatively high-quality jobs for many Belizeans. On the whole  in 2008 the international financial services industry accounted for some 9 per cent of Belize’s GDP and 10 per cent of its gross imports.  Considering the vital role that this industry plays in the Belizean economy  ensuring its integrity is in our best interests. We have developed a regulatory framework and enacted legislation for its reinforcement. We have also made commitments to the OECD to improve transparency and establish an effective exchange of information. But now  in the midst of an economic crisis that had its origin in the financial markets of the developed world  the Group  of 20 (G-20) finds it convenient to reactivate its harmful tax initiative at the expense — and to the disadvantage — of an industry we have so painstakingly and carefully groomed into a productive sector of our economy.  Beyond the calls for reform  we have heard some G-20 members call for a complete annihilation of the industry. If that were to occur  I shudder to think of the suffering and hardship it would occasion for our country and people. We are convinced that a more equitable and effective way to address the issue of offshore financial services is through a mechanism for multilateral cooperation in which all States participate on an equal footing.  Climate change poses perhaps the most serious threat to our sustainable development and viability. I need not remind the Assembly of the emerging scientific evidence  which prognosticates more rapid climate change and sea-level rise. Let me take this opportunity to applaud the Secretary-General for making climate change a priority and for convening last week’s Summit. The urgency of a global response to this issue is inescapable. We welcome the various national and regional efforts to construct mechanisms to address climate change and its impact. In our region  Belize hosts the Caribbean Community Climate Change Centre  which has benefited from the support of the international community and has been recognized as a centre of excellence.   However  we know all too well from the impacts we are observing today that piecemeal action is not sufficient. In fact  notwithstanding national and regional action  global greenhouse gas emissions continue to increase. We can only begin to respond effectively to this problem by agreeing to implement ambitious mitigation targets and increasing our support for adaptation. Considering that small island developing States and other particularly vulnerable coastal countries are already experiencing dangerous climate change  avoiding adverse effects on these especially vulnerable countries should be the benchmark for determining our targets and our levels of support. In that regard  the prophetic words of the President of the Maldives resonate with good reason: “If you can’t save the Maldives today you can’t save yourself tomorrow.”  Building upon the momentum of the much-proclaimed new era of engagement  we are hopeful that longstanding issues on the international peace and security agenda may achieve progress. In some cases  change is already afoot. Cross-Strait relations between Taiwan and China have improved and  for the first time  Taiwan has participated as an observer at the World Health Assembly. Haiti held elections earlier    09-52598 40  this year  in a relatively peaceful and orderly fashion. After 47 years  the Organization of American States has now lifted Cuba’s suspension from that body.  We welcome these developments and expect that they signal a change in approach that will allow for the full integration of our sisterly nations of Taiwan  Haiti and Cuba into their rightful place in the international community. However  for that integration to occur  we must find an appropriate way for Taiwan to participate in the activities of the specialized agencies of the United Nations  we must sustain our support for Haiti and we must urge that efforts be made to end the anachronistic embargo against Cuba.  In cases where processes have stalled  let us renew our engagement. We cannot fail in realizing the vision of two States  Israel and Palestine  living side by side within secure and recognized borders. We also cannot fail in resolving the political stalemate in our neighbour country of Honduras. Peace and security are not options  they are imperatives.  My Government is committed to securing just and lasting peace for our people. Last year  we happily concluded a special agreement with Guatemala that will pave the way for the referral of the Guatemalan territorial claim to our country to the International Court of Justice. A preliminary and critical phase is upon us  in which we must prepare our people to determine by referendum whether the case shall be referred. My Government is beginning a comprehensive public education campaign to raise awareness and ensure that  when our people decide  they will do so having been fully informed of the issues. We are approaching what could be a definitive moment in our history.  I began my statement by addressing the governance dilemma — to govern and to be governed. What is consistent in the demands that we  as developing countries — and small States in particular — have made is that we want to have a meaningful role in the governance of our affairs at the international level. We want to have meaningful input into the solutions that are being crafted for the problems that we face and of which  in some cases  we bear the disproportionate burden.   For us  the model of multilateral cooperation must be imbued with legitimacy. For that to happen  we must work for a more inclusive process. Twenty-first century challenges require a new dynamic for international relations  one that must be inclusive and  dare I say  democratic. The United Nations Charter is founded upon the premise of democracy. “We the peoples of the United Nations” assert our determination not only to be governed by the principles set out in the Charter but also to govern by these principles.  As such  the Charter itself vests in us a role in our own governance. We in Belize accept that role  and we are thus empowered  notwithstanding the pressing challenges in satisfying the basic needs of our people  to return our country to a path of sustainable development. No effort will be spared to draw upon our limited resources as well as other available resources to invest in our human resources  to improve our political and legal institutions  to support traditional and niche industries  to practise fiscal responsibility and to protect and preserve our environment for present and future generations.  We solemnly agree that our development is our own responsibility. We welcome the support of the international community in the spirit of multilateral cooperation as we take action to achieve our high aspirations."
"23",927,"BOL",64,2009,"Once again  we meet at the United Nations to share concerns  problems and experiences and to discuss the various ways in which we can serve our peoples worldwide.  Since this morning I have listened closely to statements  starting with that of the Secretary-General — to whom I offer a special  revolutionary greeting — until this moment  when we just heard the President of Iran. In all of these statements  there has been great convergence on problems such as the financial crisis  problems arising from the environmental crisis and problems concerning stability and institutionalization of democracies in a number of countries. There have also been ideas and proposals such as those offered by the Secretary-General  who called for unity among Presidents and unity within the United Nations. I fully agree that it is important that we Presidents and Governments unite to meet the demands of our peoples  in order to resolve these crises.   I would say that in my country the crises have been imposed from above and from outside. We need unity within the United Nations for the sake of the equality of our peoples; we need unity for dignity; we need unity above all to tackle the deep economic divergences  the deep asymmetries between continents  between families and between countries. But it must be unity in a context of complementarity  in order to meet our peoples’ demands.   There is an ongoing debate on the financial crisis and on climate change  as well as on the problems of democracy and the energy and food crises. I welcome a number of the statements that addressed and focused on the origins of this crisis. But the majority of Presidents and the majority of the statements referred only to the effects  not to the causes.   I would like to speak frankly to the Assembly — my listeners here  and to all others who are following the debates taking place in this global forum. I would like to say that the origin of these crises was the unbridled accumulation of capital in a few hands  the irretrievable looting of natural resources and the commercialization of Mother Earth. And above all  I believe their origin lies in an economic model  an economic system  namely  capitalism.   If we do not tell our peoples the truth about the origin of this crisis  then we will be misleading ourselves and the international community too. We will be misleading our peoples  who have great expectations of their Presidents and Governments and of forums such as this one.   Although we are promoting and seeking peace  in the light of our experience  we know that we will not find social peace while there is economic inequality  and all the less when there are military bases in some countries. These may be located on many continents  including Latin America and South America. How can we hold discussions when United States military bases provoke distrust among peoples?   I would like to briefly tell the Assembly that I was a victim of the military bases operating in my country before assuming the presidency  before the social movements were not merely opposed to policies but also actors in a new country of equality and social justice. All of us were victims of the United States military presence in Bolivia  and as victims we know what uniformed armed United States personnel can do in South American countries. For that reason  I would like to say that when there is a United States military base  particularly in Latin America — I do not know about their conduct in Europe or on other continents  but in Latin America  the presence of military bases is no guarantee of social peace or of democracy. Certainly  it cannot guarantee the integration of our countries  much less of the peoples who are seeking to bring about deep-wrought changes in our social  economic and cultural structures.     09-52228 38   Now we have Honduras. If there is a United States military base in Honduras  why can this military base not guarantee democracy? It cannot because there are Presidents who change these countries  which are constantly threatened by military bases.  I hail the courage of our colleague  President Zelaya of Honduras  who is democratically and pacifically resisting with the aim of restoring democracy. My respect and admiration go to him as he strives together with his defiant people to uphold democracy. How good it would be if the United Nations  this great international organization  were to adopt a resolution issuing an ultimatum to the military dictatorship in Honduras to withdraw and restore the only internationally recognized President.  I am convinced that the United States Southern Command does not accept Latin American countries or their Presidents that are seeking liberation. I have even heard from some friends  comrades and brothers that they supported the dictatorships in Bolivia and elsewhere in Latin America. They say that the only reason there has been no coup d’état in the United States is that there is no United States Embassy in the United States. There are coups d’état occurring everywhere  but let me say that in September last year there was an attempted coup d’état in Bolivia  and thanks to the union forces and the involvement of the international community  particularly from the southern cone  we were able to halt that civilian — not military — coup d’état.   For these reasons  we are convinced that military bases cannot guarantee democracy  integration or social peace.   We have also been discussing the subject of climate change  and I would like to take this opportunity to propose a number of issues to the Assembly which are of the utmost importance for all of us who inhabit Mother Earth. For the indigenous movement  this is Mother Earth — or  for many others  planet Earth or the environment. For those of us who live in harmony with Mother Earth  not just in harmony with human beings  Mother Earth is something sacred. It is Mother Earth which gives life  which provides water  natural resources  oxygen. We all promote the well-being of our peoples. We are struggling and fighting and working for the well-being of our peoples  but first of all  we must ensure the well-being of Mother Earth.  If we cannot guarantee the well-being of Mother Earth  then it will be impossible to guarantee the well-being of our countrymen or of all the peoples on planet Earth. I have reached the conclusion that Mother Earth — or planet Earth — can and will exist forever with or without human life. But human life cannot exist without planet Earth — Mother Earth.  After having listened to many statements and after having listened to my brothers  I have reached the conclusion that at this point in time  in this new twenty-first century  it will be more important than ever before to defend the rights of Mother Earth than to defend human rights.  If we do not protect the rights of Mother Earth  there will be no point in defending human rights. I am prepared to discuss this concept  and sooner or later everyone will understand why it is so important to defend the rights of Mother Earth.  As we are currently discussing climate change  I propose to Presidents  representatives and all our other brothers and sisters who are listening throughout the world our very simple  three-point proposal.   First  the developed countries must acknowledge and pay the climate debt that they and all humankind owe Planet Earth.  Secondly  a court for climate justice must be established to try and to punish those who fail to meet their commitments and those who continue to damage Planet Earth. We need a structure that can quantify the damage caused by some countries and transnational companies  and therefore it is important that such a court for climate justice be established.  The third proposal is one of those that have been developed above all by rural and indigenous movements: the United Nations must draw up a declaration of the rights of Mother Earth  in order to defend the right to life  the right to the regeneration of bio-capacity  the right to a clean life and the right to harmony and the coexistence of us all.  I hope that these proposals will be taken into account during the discussions in Copenhagen. We also hope that Copenhagen will provide a grand solution to resolve the serious problems that affect us all  in all the countries of the world.  I also take this opportunity to take up some of the proposals made by a number of Presidents. If we want   39 09-52228  to change the world  we must first change the United Nations. If we want to effect change in our countries  seeking equality and dignity for our compatriots  why not first change the structures of the United Nations?  Listening to what many other Presidents said about the Security Council  I felt that there were many points of agreement. We need a real democratization of the United Nations  for which I make the following suggestions.  The status of permanent membership of the Security Council and the right to veto must be abolished. It is not possible in the twenty-first century to maintain outdated totalitarian practices going back to the time of monarchies. All countries must have the same rights within the United Nations. Those who proclaim themselves to be the leaders of democracy should give up their privileges and accept true democratization of the Security Council. We must be responsible with democracy and begin to democratize the United Nations.  I shall soon end my short intervention  as I do not wish to exceed my time limit  in keeping with the discipline that our peoples teach us. But first I am sorry to have state a truth that may upset the Government of the United States. I had great hopes of President Obama. I welcome his closure of Guantanamo  which represents progress. But in addition the economic blockade of Cuba should be ended. That is my respectful request to the Government and people of the United States.  Bolivia  like Latin America as a whole  used to enjoy certain tariff preferences  but under ex-President Bush they were removed  because we were accused of not combating drug-trafficking and poverty. We know that that was a political decision  but ex-President Bush never took into account Bolivian norms or our Constitution.   Now  under President Obama’s Government  we see documents which include references to our new Constitution  which  for the first time in the 183 years’ existence of the Republic  was approved by a vote of the Bolivian people. There is a reference to article 56 and respect for private property. That strikes me as direct interference by the United States Government in the Constitution and other norms and standards  and I roundly reject it. What we want is diplomatic relations not of interference  but of cooperation and investment. While the new Constitution for the first time guarantees private property and State property  fundamentally it guarantees collective property — property held by associations and cooperatives  and communal lands belonging to the indigenous  native movement.  In addition  an accusation is made against me in a United States report stating that current challenges include the explicit acceptance and encouragement of coca production at the highest levels of the Bolivian Government. That is to say that I encourage the cultivation of coca. It should be understood that growing the coca leaf is one thing and that cocaine is quite another. We do not defend cocaine; we shall fight it. Indeed  our proposal is zero cocaine. What I have just said does not mean having free cultivation of the coca leaf  though in its natural state it is beneficial and healthy for human life.  We have launched a campaign on decriminalizing the traditional consumption of the coca leaf. I guarantee that there will never be free cultivation of coca  but neither will there a zero coca leaf policy. But there is a zero cocaine policy. It cannot be said that I encourage coca cultivation in Bolivia. That is not true.  The Assembly will know that I come from the trade union and social movements  and that I was a union leader. Now President  fortuitously and for the time being  I am extremely concerned that it is said that the Government will dismantle the union movement by decree. How could I eliminate the unions  when they and the social movements are the backbone of the Evo Morales Government? I have built union headquarters and encouraged unions  workers and indigenous peoples  and yet I am accused of dismantling the unions.  President Obama may not be aware of the documents to which I have referred  which perhaps come from the State Department. I perfectly understand that sometimes when change is desired it is difficult to change State structures. But after reading the documents very carefully I wonder how it is possible for someone who has suffered discrimination to discriminate against another. At least in Latin America  the so-called Afro-Americans and Afro-Bolivians are the sectors most discriminated against in society  together with the so-called Indians or indigenous people. We are called “negroes” and “Indians”. I do not understand how a black person who has been discriminated against and excluded can    09-52228 40  discriminate against and exclude an Indian. It is a matter of grave concern.   It is to be hoped that those historic errors can be rectified  not for the good of the President  and not just for the good of Bolivians  but for the image of peoples  such as the people of the United States. I well understand that sometimes it is not easy to change structures which may work against our peoples.  Finally  I refer  to some historical demands  such as the return of our access to the sea. Our two peoples  our brother republics  Chile and Bolivia  feel sufficient trust in each other to seek to resolve the issue of  maritime access. I hope that it can be settled bilaterally. If not  intervention by the international community will be needed. Progress has been made. I feel that there is trust  which is needed in order to resolve any problem. Otherwise  important steps must be taken.  I thank my brothers and sisters for listening to me. I would like to continue to share their experience   proposals and concerns for the good of mankind as a whole."
"24",974,"BRA",64,2009,"The General Assembly has been and must continue to be the great forum for general debate concerning humankind’s major problems.  I wish to discuss three crucial issues which I believe to be interconnected. Three perils that haunt our planet are the ongoing economic crisis  the lack of stable  democratic world governance and the threat posed by climate change to all of our lives.  Exactly one year ago  at the outset of the economic crisis that overtook the world economy  I said from this rostrum that history would never forgive us for the serious blunder of dealing only with the impact of the crisis rather than its causes. More than a crisis of big banks  this is a crisis of big dogmas. An economic  political and social outlook held to be unquestionable has simply fallen apart. A senseless way of thinking and acting which dominated the world for decades has proven itself bankrupt.  I refer to the absurd doctrine that markets could regulate themselves with no need for so-called intrusive State intervention. And I refer to the thesis of absolute freedom for financial capital  with no rules or transparency  beyond the control of people and institutions. It was an iniquitous defence of a minimal  crippled  weakened state  unable to promote development or to fight poverty and inequities.  It included the demonization of social policies  an obsession with precarious labour relations and an irresponsible commoditization of public services. The real cause of the crises is that most of the sovereignty of peoples and nations and their democratic governments had been confiscated by autonomous networks of wealth and power.  I said then that the time had come for political decisions. I said that leaders  rather than arrogant technocrats must take responsibility for bringing worldwide disorder under control. Controlling the crisis and changing the course of the world’s economy could not be left to the usual few.  Developed countries and the multilateral agencies that they run had been unable to foresee the approaching catastrophe  much less prevent it. The impact of the crisis spread around the world  striking  above all  countries that for years  and at great sacrifice  had been rebuilding their economies.  It is not fair that the price of runaway speculation be paid by those who had nothing to do with it  by workers and by poor or developing countries. Twelve months later  we can see some progress  but many doubts still persist. No one is yet clearly willing to confront serious distortions of the global economy in the multilateral arena.  The fact that we avoided a total collapse of the system has apparently given rise to an irresponsible acquiescence in certain sectors. Most of the underlying problems have been ignored. There is enormous resistance to the adoption of effective mechanisms to regulate financial markets.  Rich countries are putting off reform at multilateral agencies such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. We simply cannot understand the paralysis of the Doha Round  whose conclusion will  above all  benefit the poorest   7 09-52179  countries of our world. There are also worrisome signs of return to protectionist practices  while little has been done to fight tax havens.  Many countries  however  have not sat waiting. Brazil  fortunately one of the last countries to be hit by the crisis  is now one of the first to emerge from it. There is no magic in what we did. We simply kept our financial system from being contaminated by the virus of speculation. We had already cut back our external vulnerability as we turned from debtors into international creditors. Along with other countries  we decided to contribute resources for the IMF to lend money to the poorest countries  free of the unacceptable conditions imposed in the past.  Above all  however  both before and after the crisis broke out  we implemented countercyclical policies. We intensified our social programmes  particularly income-transfer programmes. We raised wages above inflation rates. We used fiscal measures to stimulate consumption and keep the economy moving.  We have now emerged from our brief recession. Our economy has regained its impetus and shows promise for 2010. Foreign trade is recovering vitality  the labour market is doing amazingly well and macroeconomic equilibrium has been preserved  at no cost to the victories of our people’s movements. What Brazil and other countries have shown is that  at times of crisis  we must still carry out bold social and development programmes.  Yet I hold no illusions that we might solve our problems alone  within our own borders. Because the global economy is interdependent  we are all obliged to intervene across national borders and must therefore establish once again the world economic order.  At meetings of the Group of 20 and many other meetings I have held with world leaders  I have insisted on the need to irrigate the world economy with a significant volume of credit. I have defended the regulation of financial markets  the widespread adoption of countercyclical policies  the end of protectionism and the fight against tax havens.  With the same determination  my country has proposed a true reform of the multilateral financial institutions. Poor and developing countries must increase their share of control in the IMF and the World Bank. Otherwise  there can be no real change  and the peril of new and greater crises will be inevitable. Only more representative and democratic international agencies will be able to deal with complex problems such as reorganizing the international monetary system.  Sixty-five years on  the world can no longer be run by the same rules and values that prevailed at the Bretton Woods Conference. Likewise  the United Nations and its Security Council can no longer be run under the same structures imposed after the Second World War. We are in a period of transition in international relations. We are moving towards a multilateral world. However  it is also a multipolar world  based on experiences in regional integration such as South America’s experience in creating the Union of South American Nations.  This multipolar world will not conflict with the United Nations. On the contrary  it could be an invigorating factor for the United Nations. It would create the platform for a United Nations with the political and moral authority to solve the conflicts in the Middle East  assuring the coexistence of a Palestinian State with the State of Israel; a United Nations that confronts terrorism without stigmatizing ethnic groups and religions  instead dealing with underlying causes and promoting dialogue among civilizations; a United Nations that can truly help countries such as Haiti that are trying to rebuild their economies and mend their social fabric after achieving political stability; a United Nations committed to the African renaissance that we are now seeing; a United Nations able to implement effective policies that preserve and expand human rights; a United Nations that can make real progress towards disarmament in true balance with non-proliferation; a United Nations that can truly lead in initiatives to protect the planet’s environment; a United Nations that can use its Economic and Social Council to forge decisions on confronting the economic crisis; and a United Nations that is representative enough to address threats to world peace through a reformed Security Council that is renewed and open to new permanent members.  We are not wishful thinkers. Yet it takes political will to confront and overcome situations that conspire against peace  development and democracy. Unless political will is present  throwbacks such as the embargo against Cuba will persist.  Unless there is political will  we will see more coups such as the one that toppled the constitutional    09-52179 8  President of Honduras  José Manuel Zelaya  who has been granted refuge in Brazil’s embassy in Tegucigalpa since Monday. The international community demands that Mr. Zelaya immediately return to the presidency of his country  and it must be alert to ensure the inviolability of Brazil’s diplomatic mission in the capital of Honduras.  Finally  unless political will prevails  threats to the world such as climate change will continue to grow. All countries must take action to turn back global warming. We are dismayed by the reluctance of developed countries to shoulder their share of the burden when it comes to fighting climate change. They cannot burden developing and poor countries with tasks that are theirs alone.  Brazil is doing its part. We will arrive in Copenhagen with precise alternatives and commitments. We have approved a national climate change plan that includes an 80 per cent cut in deforestation of the Amazon by 2020. We will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 4.8 billion tons — more than the sum total of all the commitments of developed countries. In 2009  we can already boast the lowest deforestation rate in 20 years.  Brazil’s energy blend is in one of the cleanest in the world. Forty-five per cent of the energy that my country consumes is renewable. In the rest of the world  only 12 per cent is renewable  while no country in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has a rate higher than 5 per cent. Eighty per cent of our electric power also comes from renewable sources.  All the gasoline sold for our passenger cars has 25 per cent ethanol blended into it. More than 80 per cent of the cars produced in our country have flexible-fuel engines that enable them to use any blend of gasoline and/or alcohol. Brazil’s ethanol and other biofuels are produced in ever-improving conditions under the ecological zoning plan that we have just sent to our National Congress. We have banned sugar cane plantations and alcohol plants in areas with native vegetation. That decision applies to the entire Amazon region as well as to other major biomes. Sugar cane production covers no more than 2 per cent of our tillable land. Unlike other biofuels  it does not affect food security  much less compromise the environment. Companies  farm workers and the Government have signed an important commitment to ensure decent working conditions on Brazil’s sugar cane plantations.  All those concerns are part of the energy policies of a country that is self-sufficient in oil and has just found major reserves that will put us in the forefront of fossil fuel production. Even so  Brazil will not relinquish its environmental agenda and simply turn into an oil giant. We plan to consolidate our role as a world Power in green energy. Meanwhile  developed countries must set emission-reduction goals that go far beyond those tabled to date  which represent a mere fraction of the reductions recommended by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. We are also deeply concerned that the funding announced to date for technological innovations needed to protect the environment in developing countries is totally insufficient.  The solutions to those and other impasses will arise only if the perils of climate change are confronted with the understanding that we share common but differentiated responsibilities.  The issues at the core of our concerns — the financial crisis  new global governance and climate change — have one strong common denominator: the need to build a new international order that is sustainable  multilateral and less asymmetric  free of hegemonies and ruled by democratic institutions. Such a new world is a political and moral imperative. We cannot just shovel away the rubble of failure; we must be midwives to the future. That is the only way to make amends for so much injustice and to prevent new collective tragedies."
"25",1018,"BRB",64,2009,"On behalf of my delegation  I am pleased to join the speakers who have preceded me in congratulating Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. He may rest assured of the full support and cooperation of Barbados as he carries out his important duties. I wish also to take this opportunity to express appreciation to his predecessor  Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann  for his leadership of the sixty-third session.  We meet at a pivotal moment in the history of the United Nations. Never since the founding of this Organization has our community of nations been tested by a confluence of so many devastating crises as we have witnessed in the recent past. It is therefore with a sense of honour  fully recognizing the responsibility entrusted to me and to all of us here  that I address this General Assembly for the first time in my capacity as Minister responsible for Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade of Barbados.  Barbados commends Mr. Treki for his choice of theme for this year’s general debate  given the myriad crises that we face and the need for effective global responses. Indeed  the world is facing major economic  political and social upheaval. The threat of food and fuel scarcity  the worst economic and financial crisis in decades  the challenge of climate change and the influenza pandemics have all assumed an international and multidimensional character. Together  these have undermined the very foundations of our multilateral system  exacerbating already existing disparities.  The approach of the developed economies to this crisis has been to create national stimulus packages and to bail out their failing industries — in short  to turn to policies which address their domestic interests almost exclusively. Developing countries are suffering the brunt of the effects of the financial crisis created by greed and poor regulation in developed countries. Faced with stagnating or falling economic growth due to factors beyond our control  we are now left to deal with declining economic activity and a resulting rise in unemployment along with its resulting problems at a   15 09-52604  time when we are forced to battle increasing debt and decreasing external trade and foreign investment revenues.  While we welcome the initiatives to create rescue packages for the least developed countries  there is a clearly demonstrated need to expand these initiatives to include a wider group of developing countries. Barbados is one of a small group classified as small  highly indebted middle-income countries  which has been overlooked  but which is deserving of international attention and assistance from bilateral partners and the multilateral institutions alike. As we discuss the effects of the global crisis and propose assistance for affected countries  there is a need to ensure that countries like Barbados are recognized within the broad category of small vulnerable economies.  Multilateral agencies such as the World Bank have established through empirical research and their ongoing interventions that these countries are unique in the openness of their economies and in their susceptibility to external shocks. However  this group continues to be excluded from concessionary financing and debt relief. Focus continues to be placed on per capita income data  which is a poor indicator of economic sustainability and national vulnerability. Our countries are in need of adequate support mechanisms with revised eligibility criteria in order to prevent the derailment of our development processes.  This crisis presents an opportunity for the developed economies and the international financial institutions to address the existing failures and shortcomings of the current financial system. The time is right for the crafting of a new  more transparent architecture that is supportive of development objectives.  Barbados  for its part  is extremely proud that despite its handicaps it has managed — through good governance and the observance of democratic principles  human rights and the rule of law — to provide an adequate standard of living for its people. However  this does not negate our inherent vulnerabilities  our limited resources or our restricted capacity to respond to the vagaries of the economic environment.  One of the major positive consequences of the current crisis is the increase in South-South cooperation  which has played a quiet but important role over the years in promoting trade and investment among developing countries. This has served to enhance the value of such cooperation and presents great potential for future growth and development.  At the national level  an important lesson learned is that development requires the active involvement of communities  the public and private sectors and civil society. This has been clearly demonstrated in the implementation of our social partnership agreements  a strategy that has been very successful in the Barbadian context since the early 1990s and has been used as a model in other developing countries.  Recent world events have highlighted the importance of taking a multilateral approach to solving global problems. The United Nations is perhaps the institution best suited to the task of mobilizing global responses. Regrettably  over the past year the United Nations has been relegated to a subordinate role in the search for solutions to the ongoing economic and financial crisis.  Barbados will not be complicit in any effort to marginalize the United Nations  which has a unique and legitimate role in global economic decision-making and rule-setting. We will not join the sceptics in questioning the relevance or legitimacy of this vital multilateral organization. However  we will continue to be at the forefront of calls for its reform to ensure that it is fully equipped and empowered to assist Member States in confronting global challenges.  To date  efforts to reform the United Nations have been piecemeal in nature  largely uncoordinated and at times even conflicting. The extraordinary challenges we face demand comprehensive reform. This will require a level of transformation that equips the United Nations for the twenty-first century. At this session  priority needs to be given to securing commitment at the highest level to finalizing the reform agenda.  Security Council reform must be prioritized if effective change within the United Nations system is to be achieved. It is evident that the structure  composition and working methods of the Security Council fail to reflect current global realities. Barbados believes that membership in the Security Council should be expanded in both the permanent and the non-permanent categories. Our goal must be to ensure that the Council is more representative  democratic and accountable to the full membership of the United Nations without placing its effectiveness in jeopardy.    09-52604 16   The reality of global interdependence is that our destinies are inextricably linked. We cannot retreat to isolationism or radicalism. We must  with a sense of urgency and purpose  create the multilateral infrastructure necessary to manage a complex and interdependent world. This new quest for a better and more effective multilateralism must be shared by all. Our collective effort must also seek to restore the role of the United Nations envisaged by its founders: “to be a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations”.  In his address to the General Assembly at its sixty-third session  the Prime Minister of Barbados (see A/63/PV.12)  The Honourable David Thompson  reaffirmed his belief in the positive role that small States can play in advancing the cause of international peace and equitable social and economic development and emphasized the importance of building an international system that operates on the principle of multilateralism and that respects the sovereign equality of States and the tenets of genuine non-alignment.  Barbados is concerned by the growing tendency of limited-membership groups to assume decision-making powers on issues affecting the entire international community without the consent or involvement of that community. We stand to squander the opportunities to create a fair and more equitable system of global governance if responsibility for rule- and decision-making remains vested in limited-membership groupings which are accountable only to themselves. No exclusive group of countries  no matter how big  powerful or rich  has a monopoly on solutions.  The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea  the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the International Criminal Court were all championed by some of the smallest members of the United Nations and represent just a few examples of the invaluable contribution that small States have made to strengthening multilateralism and providing solutions to complex global problems. Small States can be effective partners in the search for global solutions to the ongoing crises  and those countries must have a seat at the table when decisions are being made on issues of global concern.  In this regard  the targeting of small offshore jurisdictions in the wake of the global financial crisis on the pretext that these jurisdictions in some way contributed to the crisis represents an injustice worthy of the strongest possible condemnation. For those who would wish to rewrite history  we must recall that the financial crisis had its origins in the developed world and resulted from excessive risk-taking  corruption  fraud and ineffective regulatory controls and oversight in those countries.  Barbados fully supports the proposal of the States members of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) to build upon the existing programme already in place within the United Nations to address issues related to international financial services. Specifically  we call for the Committee of Experts on International Cooperation on Tax Matters to be transformed into an intergovernmental subsidiary body of the Economic and Social Council. The central goal of the proposed intergovernmental committee would be to give developing countries an effective voice when issues of cooperation on tax matters are being decided by the international community.  Small democratic States like my own are convinced of the need to ensure adherence to the rule of law and respect for constitutional norms. We are therefore compelled to register our deep concern at any interruption of the constitutional order of any sovereign State and the dangerous precedent this could create if left unchallenged by the international community. Barbados fully supports the position of CARICOM and the Organization of American States  which calls for the immediate reinstatement to office of the legally elected President of Honduras.  Barbados is equally concerned to ensure that  in our hemisphere  the relics of a past cold war era give way to a new spirit of regional partnership  in which diverse political systems can coexist in harmony. We are therefore heartened by the positive developments with respect to the reintegration of our sister Republic of Cuba into the mainstream of hemispheric affairs. We are hopeful that the renewed dialogue between the United States and Cuba will lead in the near future to the complete removal of the embargo and the normalization of relations between those two countries.  Barbados welcomes the support provided by the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH)  which has been a vital tool for capacity-building in Haiti in the key areas of governance  the strengthening of the rule of law  and human rights. We therefore call upon the Security Council to extend the mandate of MINUSTAH so that   17 09-52604  the international community can continue to provide support to the people of Haiti in their quest for sustainable peace and development.  As a small island  Barbados is aware of the grave dangers posed by climate change. The damage done to our coastline and coral reefs illustrates the potential threats that flow from the phenomenon of global warming. Such threats are not peculiar to Barbados  but are posed in myriad ways to nations across the globe  both developed and developing.  In three months we will meet in Copenhagen to decide on a course of action to address this global threat of unprecedented proportions. We know the catastrophic consequences of failing to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. What is required is a massive transformation of the way energy is generated and used to propel economic growth and development.  In Barbados we have committed to reducing our dependence on imported oil and have significantly increased our use of renewable energy. Furthermore  we have identified transitioning to a green economy as a national priority. We have established a number of key milestones and indicators to assess progress towards the achievement of that goal. We have undertaken those activities with minimal support from the international community  utilizing our own resources. We have been forced to divert an increased share of our national budget to finance adaptation measures. According to World Bank estimates  the total annual impact of potential climate change on all CARICOM countries is estimated at $9.9 billion a year  or around 11.3 per cent of the total annual gross domestic product of all CARICOM member States and associate members.  The international community has a moral and ethical responsibility to support urgent and ambitious global action to provide adaptation funding for small island developing States. In the Caribbean  our ability to address climate change has been severely hampered by the effects of the global financial and economic crisis. An essential measure of success at Copenhagen  therefore  will be the extent to which the decisions that we take serve to ensure the survival and continued viability of small island developing States.  Before closing  permit me to seek the support of the General Assembly on an issue that has emerged as a crucial health challenge for many countries  including those of the Caribbean. Chronic non-communicable diseases have become one of the major causes of morbidity. We believe that that issue must be included in the global discussions on development. We therefore support the call made by the Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago for a special session of the General Assembly on that issue (see ).  Finally  in these difficult times we have a number of challenging issues before us for consideration. Despite our various agendas and differing priorities  we share an ultimate common goal: to achieve peace  security and development for all the peoples of the world. Until that becomes a reality  no country is truly secure. I reaffirm Barbados’ commitment to working with other Member States to attain that goal."
"26",1050,"BRN",64,2009,"I would like to congratulate the President on his election  as well as to express my appreciation to the outgoing President for his contributions over the past year. I would also like to thank the Secretary-General  his staff and the agencies of the United Nations for doing such a fine job all over the world in very difficult situations. It is very much appreciated.  I like the theme for this year’s debate  but it is a very long one. So I would like to say a few things about the first two words  namely  effective responses. I think that they are the most important ones. There is no problem with the second word. We all know what responses are  because we make them every day. But “effective” is a far more difficult word  and that is because none of us here actually decides what it means. It is not up to us to judge whether our work is successful or not. That is up to the next generation. In other words  it is our children and grandchildren who are going to look back at the past and see whether we did a good job. That is the way it has always been.  That is what many of us in Brunei Darussalam have been doing recently  because this year is an important anniversary for us. It is now 25 years since we joined the Organization. Those of us who were here at that time remember it very well. We remember exactly why we joined. It was a dangerous period  and a small country like ours did not want to be left on its own. We wanted to be part of a larger community  a world community. But there was a real problem. The cold war was on and nearly everyone was divided into two camps. That meant that we had to choose sides. That did not help us very much at all. Looking at the United Nations today  I would judge its response to the past 25 years as very effective. Things are much better than they were back then. Certainly  many of the old problems may still be with us  such as terrorism  poverty  disease  war and the 60-year struggle by the Palestinian people for justice  hope and dignity. But we also have a lot of good things going for us nowadays. We have much more knowledge. Communication is better than ever before. The best thing of all is that we are not divided into two camps. As a result  we have far more opportunities.  When our next generation looks back at us and judges us  I think that the question they will be asking will be: What did we do with those opportunities? In other words  were our responses effective ones? Getting back to where we are now  I think we have opportunities to make a great response.  The Secretary-General and his staff have important proposals for reform  change and development. If we accept them and do something about them  we can take the biggest opportunity of all: we can change the whole direction of world affairs. What is more  I think that this is exactly what people want us to do.  There is a lot of support for change outside this building. No one really wants to carry on being split up into developed or developing nations any more  or as first  second or third worlds. They want us to be in one world  in one situation  sharing its problems and being part of any solution.  That is the message many of us got after the first Group of 20 (G-20) meeting  back in April of this year. It seemed to give us a real choice — either to keep on doing things the way we have always done since 1946 or to change directions and all work together  big and small  regardless of background  culture or faith  and find a new way into the twenty-first century.  This week’s G-20 meeting in Pittsburgh sent out the same message  and it was good to hear. It is only a soft message and a small change. The big decisions are still being made for us  and not with us. But at least it is a start. It is the kind of change we want to see  and    09-52592 44  there is nothing to stop us from taking it a long way further. After all  it is not like 25 years ago. We have a real choice and no one is forcing us to take sides. So for the moment it is up to us. The key words  however  are “for the moment”.  The G-20 are not the only ones sending us messages. There are other very important ones. They are coming from the environment  the climate  the global economy and energy and food supplies  and they all add up to a serious warning. They are telling us that very soon the choice will not be ours to make. Any changes will be made by forces that we cannot control. That means any response may be largely ineffective. When the next generation looks back at us  they may not just be judging us. They could even be condemning us."
"27",1091,"BTN",64,2009,"I should like to congratulate the President on his election to preside over the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. We are confident that under his able leadership and guidance  our deliberations will be successful. I assure him of my delegation’s fullest support and cooperation. I would also like to convey our deep appreciation to his predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann  for his leadership at the sixty-third session.  It has been only 18 months since my country successfully made the transition to a democratic constitutional monarchy. Within this period  the elected Government has made every effort to establish a strong foundation for a sustainable and vibrant democracy  as it is these initial years that will determine the direction of democracy in Bhutan. Concrete steps are being taken to empower the people and to ensure that democracy truly benefits every citizen.  The people of Bhutan  although hesitant at first  were guided and encouraged by our enlightened and visionary monarchs and have fully embraced democracy. From our experience so far  we are confident that a strong foundation for democracy has been established; it is now time to nurture and continue to strengthen this foundation.  The world is grappling with multiple  interlinked global crises. The impact of these crises has been particularly severe on the least developed countries  where levels of poverty and insecurity are already high. The food and energy crises have driven millions of the most vulnerable people deeper into poverty and further desperation. Meeting their needs and freeing them from the cycle of poverty continues to be the major challenge to development and to achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). It is inconceivable that  in an era of unprecedented prosperity  the vast majority of the world’s population remains in poverty and destitution. The alleviation of poverty  therefore  must be at the forefront of the international community’s development efforts.  Since the adoption of the Monterrey Consensus in 2002  developing countries have made significant progress in many areas of domestic resource mobilization. However  challenges remain  especially during the current economic slowdown  for developing countries to mobilize adequate domestic resources to meet their development needs. For many such countries  official development assistance (ODA) remains the most important source of external financing for achieving their development objectives and attaining the MDGs. We therefore encourage donor countries to take concrete steps towards fulfilling their ODA commitments.  In Bhutan  we have achieved relative socio-economic progress over the past five years. The annual gross domestic product growth rate has averaged around 8 per cent  the national literacy rate has reached 60 per cent and health coverage has been sustained at 90 per cent. The royal Government continues to accord high priority to the social sector. Bhutan launched its tenth five-year plan in July 2008 with the overarching goal of poverty reduction and implementing MDG-based initiatives. As this is the first plan to be implemented under our first elected Government  its successful implementation is of paramount importance to reaffirming the people’s faith in parliamentary democracy and ensuring a successful political transition.  These successes in the political  social and economic fields would not have been possible without the support of our development partners  bilateral and multilateral. To them I offer our deep gratitude and appreciation  and we look forward to their continued assistance and support during this critical transitional phase.  It is becoming increasingly evident that the impact of continuing climate change cannot be ignored. While its adverse effects will spare none  small    09-52598 46  developing countries will bear a heavier burden  even though they contribute the least to the causes. Despite Bhutan’s negligible emission of greenhouse gases  our fragile mountain ecology faces potential threats  primarily the adverse impact on agriculture  which is the mainstay of our people. Erratic and severe weather patterns and the threat of glacial lake outburst floods are of particular concern to Bhutan. Other hazards  such as flash floods  landslides  forest fires and droughts  are also likely to increase. When Cyclone Aila hit the Bay of Bengal in May  it also had disastrous and widespread effects in Bhutan  touching every corner of the country. Precious lives were lost; power and water supplies affected; roads  bridges and vital infrastructure damaged. Farms  the most vulnerable sector  were the worst affected.  Our capacity to carry out adaptation and mitigation measures is severely constrained by our lack of scientific  technical and financial resources. Bhutan has always maintained that climate change must be addressed within the framework of sustainable development. The issues are inextricably linked to development  and any debate on the subject must take into consideration equity and the right of developing countries to be able to provide their people with better livelihoods.  My delegation appreciates the initiative of the Secretary-General in convening the high-level Summit on Climate Change. It provided the necessary political impetus for negotiations to be concluded in Copenhagen this December. We must now advance the progress of the multilateral negotiations in every possible way to ensure that tangible results are achieved in Copenhagen for the well-being of present and future generations. In this regard  I am pleased to inform this gathering that Bhutan will assume the chair of and host the sixteenth summit of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) in April 2010. Given the importance of the subject  climate change and environment will be the Summit’s theme  and the issue will receive our leaders’ highest attention when they meet in Thimphu.  Terrorism in all forms and manifestations is a serious threat to domestic as well as global peace and security. It endangers and undermines our common values of respect for human rights and the rule of law  and our basic desire to live in peace and harmony. Preventing terrorism preserves these fundamental values  through which we can achieve lasting peace and security.  Even my country  which has always enjoyed peace and stability  has not been spared this evil menace. Bhutan therefore fully supports the international consensus on taking firm action against terrorism. The General Assembly’s adoption of the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy (resolution 60/288) was an important political achievement that represents our common approach to combating the scourge of global terrorism. We must show similar commitment in concluding a comprehensive convention on international terrorism. Within our region  the leaders of SAARC have concluded an agreement on mutual legal assistance in criminal matters  reaffirming our region’s commitment to collectively addressing the evils of terrorism.  Bhutan accords high importance to reform of the United Nations  particularly the revitalization of the General Assembly and reform of the Security Council. We fully support the expansion of the Security Council in both its permanent and non-permanent membership. For their active role in global affairs and their capacity and resources to shoulder greater responsibilities  reflect present global realities and make the United Nations more representative  we fully support electing India  Japan  Brazil and Germany  plus two African countries  to be permanent Security Council members.   My delegation is greatly encouraged by the momentum gained in the intergovernmental negotiations on the reform process. We hope that the sixty-fourth session will build on the progress achieved so far and bring this long-drawn-out process to a successful conclusion under Mr. Treki’s leadership.  Natural calamities are occurring regularly every year  and smaller developing countries are increasingly faced with the challenge of coping with such problems. Just last week  my country was severely affected by an earthquake that measured 6.3 on the Richter scale. It is one of the biggest disasters we have experienced in recent times. Its devastating effects were felt in six districts of eastern Bhutan  where 13 people lost their lives and many were left injured and homeless. About 1 900 homes  numerous schools  Government offices and historical monuments were destroyed or damaged. The full impact is still being ascertained. During this difficult period  we have been comforted by the outpouring of support from friendly countries such as   47 09-52598  India and others  which have rendered much-needed technical and financial assistance for the massive relief work.  Given the increasing frequency of such severe natural calamities and their negative effects on many parts of the world  there is a need for institutionalized disaster preparedness and response mechanisms at the national  regional and global levels. In this context  the establishment of the United Nations Central Emergency Fund is an important step towards providing the disaster relief that is urgently required for life-saving operations. Bearing this in mind and as an expression of our continued support for the commendable humanitarian work of the United Nations  Bhutan has made a modest contribution to the Fund  which we hope to increase in the coming years.  These are indeed difficult times with multiple crises hitting us simultaneously. The threat of climate change is real and its effects are occurring even as I speak. Global governance needs to be made more effective to help us address the global challenges more efficiently. In this interdependent world  it will be impossible for any country to act alone in resolving these crises. Therefore  as we gather here once again to deliberate and find solutions to the many difficult problems confronting us  I conclude by reiterating my delegation’s full support and cooperation in working towards addressing our common challenges."
"28",1132,"BWA",64,2009,"I congratulate you  Sir  on your election as President of the General Assembly and on the very effective manner in which you are presiding over its proceedings. I also pay tribute to your predecessor  Mr. D’Escoto Brockmann  for his leadership and commitment and for the very able manner in which he guided us throughout the past session. Under his leadership  a lot was achieved and we also weathered a number of turbulent storms.  The global economic environment has experienced many challenges since our last session. Never before has our common goal of advancing the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter for the betterment of all mankind been so tested. The challenges confronting humanity have since grown tenfold  both in scope and magnitude. The sheer enormity of these fast-evolving challenges threatens the very existence of the human race and the security of our planet.  I am convinced that these challenges are neither beyond our collective capability to address  nor are they insurmountable. Our moral imperative is to ensure   09-53165 40  that the United Nations has the requisite resources  the tools and the capability to respond to the ever-changing environment in a timely  effective and decisive manner in order to help Member States address the many complex and multidimensional challenges.  It is important to remind ourselves of the decision we adopted at the World Summit in 2005 to  “strengthen the United Nations with a view to enhancing its authority and efficiency  as well as its capacity to address effectively … the full range of challenges of our time”. (resolution 60/1  para. 146)  In that respect  my delegation welcomes the progress made in implementing ongoing reforms of the United Nations with a view to streamlining rules  mandates and policies in order to promote transparency  coherence and efficiency in the system.  The global economic crisis that has besieged us has accentuated existing challenges and made them more complex. The crisis has been felt more seriously in developing countries. Human  financial and other resources are severely overstretched as countries seek creative and innovative ways to mitigate what has become the greatest economic threat of our time. The crisis therefore warrants a concerted effort involving both developed and developing countries. We should emerge from the crisis stronger and wiser  with new thinking about a new global financial architecture.  In the present circumstances  poverty levels in many economies appear to be spiraling out of control. Our poverty reduction strategies therefore need to be revised to face the new challenges. That goes for the commitments we signed on to at the 1995 Copenhagen World Summit on Sustainable Development and at the 2000 Millennium Summit. The new strategy should focus on raising the living standards of all people the world over. In dealing with those challenges  we should deploy all the resources of nature and technology to better life on the planet. But in doing so we should avoid any actions that could endanger the very lives that we want to uplift.  The devastating HIV/AIDS pandemic is among the myriad challenges to which we committed ourselves to tackle through international cooperation and assistance. HIV/AIDS undoubtedly continues to be one of the most daunting challenges of our time.  In June of last year  our leaders gathered in New York for the midterm review of the implementation of the goals and targets of the Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS  which was adopted in 2001. The review revealed that  despite heightened political momentum and national and global responses to HIV/AIDS  not much progress had been made towards mitigating its effects. Only a handful of countries were reported to be on track to achieving some of their commitments  while the majority of countries were found to be lagging far behind in implementing them. That situation underscores the urgent need to accelerate the momentum for universal access to HIV/AIDS prevention  treatment  care and support.  The ongoing global economic crisis has already placed people living with HIV/AIDS at great risk  as many countries have had to cut down on some HIV/AIDS programmes due to budgetary constraints. Budget reductions in HIV/AIDS programmes  in particular  in developing countries  will obviously result in increased loss of life  as well as an increase in the cost of health care in the future.  We need to redouble our implementation efforts as we draw closer to the 2010 deadline for achieving the goal of ensuring universal access to HIV/AIDS prevention  treatment  care and support. To that end  it is essential that as Governments we renew our commitment to put our people first when it comes to the kind of policies and programmes we formulate and implement.  The adverse impact of climate change and global warming is another problem that requires our urgent and sustained attention. Our collective response to the challenge of climate change and global warming necessitates pragmatism and decisive action. History will judge us harshly if we cannot muster the political will and commitment to put in place measures required to save planet Earth. The Copenhagen meeting scheduled for December of this year provides an opportunity to galvanize the efforts of the international community to address the challenges of climate change.  More important  the Copenhagen meeting will be a defining moment in the negotiations on the global commitments to be made with regard to the Kyoto Protocol after 2012. Botswana is strongly committed to those negotiations. We will do everything in our power to ensure their successful and timely conclusion. We   41 09-53165  therefore call upon Member States to ensure that no effort is spared in giving the issues under negotiation the priority attention that they deserve.  Turning to international peace and security  my delegation is deeply concerned about the deterioration of the global security situation. We are convinced that the security of our world is dependent upon the entire membership of the United Nations working in unison.  The number and intensity of conflicts still raging in some parts of the world  in particular in Africa  is a cause for grave concern. It is sad that Africa appears — at least in my estimation — to have experienced more incidents of civil strife and violent confrontation than any other part of the world. In that regard  it is worth noting that the Security Council remains seized of conflict situations and developments in a number of African countries and regions  including Chad  the Central African Republic  the Democratic Republic of the Congo  the Great Lakes region  Eritrea and Ethiopia  Somalia and the Sudan  to name but a few.  Somalia remains the most dangerous place in the world  and a blemish on the conscience of the international community. Incidents of violence  kidnapping  banditry and piracy abound. Peacekeepers have also not been spared that barbarity. We commend Burundi and Uganda for the courage and heroism of their troops in support of the peace effort. International support and assistance is urgently required to deploy a stabilization force to strengthen the African Union Mission in Somalia and to support long-term peace and stability in that country.  With regard to the situations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Great Lakes region  it is thanks to the collective efforts of the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and former President Obasanjo of Nigeria  Special Representative of the Secretary-General for the Great Lakes Region  as well as other international initiatives  that there are now prospects for positive developments. However  we should not underestimate the gravity of the challenges that continue to hamper the achievement of lasting peace  stability and sustainable development in that region and many more in Africa.  Apart from finding lasting solutions to conflicts  we should put in place measures to deal with post-conflict situations  as there is a danger that countries emerging from conflict could easily relapse into it. Regional bodies such as the African Union  as well as the United Nations  must stay focused on assisting countries to deal with both conflict and post-conflict situations.  We all know the causes of conflict and instability. They are the result of bad governance  mismanagement of national resources and the absence of democracy. In that respect  we cannot simply demand the full and active support of the international community in efforts to achieve lasting peace and stability. We must do more to consolidate the democratic process  respect for human rights and the rule of law. In that way  we would be more deserving and worthy of assistance.  Botswana is disturbed by the emerging trend of coups and of the unconstitutional transfer of power in Africa and in other parts of the world. We had thought that the era of military coups was now history. We unreservedly condemn the coups that took place in Mauritania  Guinea  Guinea-Bissau  Madagascar and Honduras. We would have been very disappointed if one such as Rajoelina  who masterminded the overthrow of a democratically elected Government in Madagascar  had been allowed to address this Assembly. We therefore applaud the decision taken by the General Assembly in that regard.   The Southern Africa Development Community correctly decided to suspend the regime in Madagascar from participating in the councils and structures of the subregional organization. Our continental organization  the African Union  has also maintained a principled position of automatically suspending any regime that comes into power by overthrowing the constitutional order. The international community must be united in its determination to isolate the regime in Antananarivo. We must not give it any comfort by embracing it in international forums.  We are also witnessing a disturbing development that undermines democracy and subverts the will of the people. There is a growing resort to changing constitutions in order to prolong the grip on power of leaders and political parties that have lost elections. In that regard  Africa  and indeed the world at large  must collectively and in one voice reject the extra-parliamentary transfer of power and isolate illegal regimes until constitutional order is restored. Embracing them in any small measure would be immoral and would perpetuate those hideous acts throughout the globe.   09-53165 42   The world can be a better place for us and for future generations if we persistently nurture democratic practices  good governance and respect for the rule of law. As leaders  we should commit to building fraternity and greater mutual understanding among peoples across cultures and faiths. We have the responsibility to lead by example. We must desist from using inflammatory language that promotes tension and conflicts.  We cannot and must not condone leaders who  for their own selfish interests  change the constitutions of their countries in order to ensure their continued stay in power. At the same time  we should ensure that our elections are credible and that they reflect the sovereign will of the people. Governments should not be allowed to conduct elections and then tamper with the outcomes in order to suit their interests. People must be allowed to freely choose their leaders.  Botswana reiterates its position that it is fully committed to respecting the integrity and impartiality of the International Criminal Court so that it can freely carry out its judicial mandate. We equally support the principle of universal jurisdiction under international law and practice. However  we object to situations wherein its abuse becomes blatant.  In conclusion  I wish to reiterate that the daunting challenges facing our world today  as stated previously  cannot and should not be tackled by any one country or by a group of countries alone. They require a strong multilateral approach that needs the commitment and unyielding support of the international community as a whole. Let us join hands together in an effort to address those complex challenges. Our timely  coordinated and effective action will go a long way in securing a better future for generations to come.   "
"29",1175,"CAF",64,2009,"May I begin by congratulating Mr. Treki on his unanimous election to preside over the work of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. His election to that position is an honour to the entire African continent and a worthy tribute to the Great Socialist People’s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya  whose devotion to the African cause goes without saying.  Furthermore and on behalf of His Excellency General François Bozizé  President of the Republic  who wishes him every success in his work  I assure him of the support of the Central African delegation in achieving the full success of his lofty task this year. His demonstrated knowledge of the United Nations and of world problems will ensure the success of the present session. I also wish to congratulate Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann of Nicaragua on his excellent contribution to the previous session in his capacity as President.  However  before delivering my assessment the state of the world in the face of the new challenges of the twenty-first century and my country’s perspective on the main issues to be addressed at this session  I should also like to commend the tireless work of the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  who spares no effort in promoting the principles and purposes of the United Nations. To him  I once again express the deep gratitude of the people of the Central African Republic for his notable contributions with regard to the situation in the Central African Republic and his support within the framework of the Peacebuilding Commission.   In fact  in March this year  pursuant to my Government’s request  a country configuration of the   37 09-52470  Peacebuilding Commission was established under the Belgian presidency. The Commission is working together with Central African authorities to strengthen the achievements of peace and make it possible to implement the recommendations resulting from the inclusive political dialogue held from 8 to 20 December 2008  regarding in particular the disarmament  demobilization and reintegration programme  security sector reform and the process leading up to the 2010 general elections.  My country welcomes this session because of the items on our agenda  which are true matters of global concern. Indeed  it should be recalled that we have several challenges to meet: development  peace and security  climate change and its effects  terrorism and necessary United Nations reform. The choice of theme for this debate — “Effective responses to global crises  strengthening multilateralism and dialogue among civilizations for international peace  security and development” — is inspired. In fact  the changes in the world’s configuration have given rise to new challenges that can be addressed only through international cooperation. Thus  multilateralism now appears to be the only way to resolve the world’s problems.  In this era of globalization and technological advances  forums for cooperation — even the most firmly established ones — must address new demands calling for appropriate and united responses.   I am grateful for the honour shown to the Central African Republic  and I should like to stress the correlation among some of the issues raised since the beginning of this general debate. With regard to the world situation  this session is being held in a particularly worrisome context. This is a critical time for addressing global political issues at all levels — a time that requires us  as nations  to seek solutions in a spirit of dialogue  cooperation and openness. The current world scene poses major challenges in the areas of peace and security  economic development and social progress  and human rights and the rule of law.  As far as crucial development issues are concerned  the world economic and financial crisis remains an unprecedented event in terms of its impact and the upheavals in the world’s economic and financial systems. It requires a reorganization leading to a new world order in this area. Besides that option  however  other ways to emerge from the present crisis could be to develop production capacity  to strengthen trade capacity for the benefit of developing countries and to implement strategic partnerships among the various regions to which the Organization’s Members belong.   The food crisis  which was caused by rising prices and whose harmful effects continue to keep a large part of the world in conditions of famine and abject poverty  requires that we promote the agricultural sector  industry and the utilization of mining resources. The rise in food prices has caused a significant deterioration in the terms of trade among countries in the most affected regions  including the African continent generally and  in particular  the Central African Republic. That situation could lead to greater inflationary pressure and a deteriorating balance of payments. The impact is being felt both at the macroeconomic level and in terms of household income and food security.   The contributions of regional economic communities and United Nations agencies such as the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations  the World Food Programme  the International Fund for Agricultural Development and the World Bank  will be invaluable in the quest for a coordinated solution to this crisis. Agricultural development should be encouraged with a view to ensuring sustainable growth and improvements in people’s means of subsistence  based on the sound management of environmental and natural resources.   Programmes and activities to promote long-term growth should  of course  be carried out in accordance with the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). In 2000  when we committed ourselves to achieving the Goals by 2015  we aroused legitimate hopes throughout the developing world. We do not have the right to dash those hopes  which would worsen the North-South fracture and further deepen the divisions within our own societies  with incalculable risks for the governance and stability of States.   A little more than nine years after the Millennium Summit  it is indisputable that significant progress has been made  but we must acknowledge that  in many countries in Africa and elsewhere  a large majority of the population lives in abject poverty. The Millennium Development Goals are the surest way to speed the progress of African peoples towards well-being. The development projects in the MDG sectors need stable     09-52470 38  sufficient and predictable long-term funding. We thus regard this session of the General Assembly as an opportunity to raise the awareness of all international development financing institutions  without exception  and lead them to effectively pledge to mobilize and transfer the financial resources necessary to achieve the Millennium Development Goals.   Likewise  the Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the Decade 2001-2010  aimed at significantly improving the living conditions of the more than 600 million people living in those countries  is concluding and thus should be reviewed in order to address the marginalization and the new socio-economic challenges facing least developed countries.   Climate change joins the challenges confronting our world  because the economy  the environment and the way of life of every nation represented here are threatened.   At the United Nations Climate Change Conference held in Bali  Indonesia  in 2007  world leaders decided to negotiate a new agreement on climate change to succeed the Kyoto Protocol in 2012. In the Bali Road Map  States defined spheres of action and agreed to take them into account during the post-Kyoto negotiations. The working meeting of the heads of State of the G8+5 in L’Aquila on 9 July 2009 examined the issue of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  My country is committed to the global fight against climate change  as demonstrated by its ratification of several international instruments on climate issues. I am referring to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol.  For the Central African Republic  the challenge of climate change relates to not only mitigation  namely reductions in greenhouse gas emissions  but also to adaptation to the harmful effects of that change. However  for vulnerable States  with a weak economy like ours  the cost of adaptation  calculated at several tens of billions of dollars a year  puts a still greater strain on our limited resources and increases poverty. This is an opportunity for me to express the wish that assistance in combating climate change not replace official development assistance.  We have not come to this sixty-fourth session of the General Assembly to point an accusing finger at the States responsible for global warming  but rather  like the brother countries of Africa  to convey a message to the leaders of the world. Africa will continue its efforts to preserve its forest ecosystems  but the rich countries must assume their responsibilities to reach concrete proposals for post-Kyoto.  We support France’s proposal at the summit on climate change  held on 22 September 2009  for the establishment of a world environment organization  the implementation of the Bali Road Map through technology transfers to developing countries  and the financing of efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However  we strongly hope that  in Copenhagen next December  the common position of the countries of Central Africa  which share the forests of the Congo basin  will be taken into account.  Allow me here to recall that the countries of Central Africa  members of the Commission for the Forests of Central Africa (COMIFAC)  signed a declaration in Bangui on 11 September 2008 in which they call on the institutions of the United Nations system  the European Union  the International Organization of la Francophonie  the Secretariat of the New Partnership for Africa’s Development and the high-level panel of experts to support them in their effort  inter alia  to include issues relating to the management of tropical forests in the post-Kyoto arrangements.   The forests of the Congo basin  the second largest forest system in the world  play a key role in regulating the global climate. The efforts to conserve and sustainably manage the forests of that natural space agreed to by the member countries of COMIFAC should be encouraged as part of the process of reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries. In Copenhagen  we must reach a fair agreement  based on win-win partnerships that enable developing countries to reconcile the preservation of natural resources with economic development.  The Central African Republic fully supports the statement made by the Chairperson of the African Union Commission at its recent special session on the consideration and resolution of conflicts in Africa  held in Tripoli  Libya  on 31 August 2009. It shares the conviction that economic growth and sustainable   39 09-52470  development are intertwined with the status of and trends in world peace and security.   In view of the proliferation of arms of all kinds  disarmament is a pressing issue. The United Nations Disarmament Commission must promote resolutions that encourage multilateralism in the area of disarmament and non-proliferation  the reduction of military budgets and respect for environmental standards in the drawing up and implementation of disarmament agreements. An effort is also needed to overcome the current impasse and to achieve nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation in all their forms. The strategic doctrine adopted by nuclear-weapon States that justifies the use of or threat of the use of atomic weapons is as dangerous as uranium enrichment for weapons purposes and should simply be discarded.   On the other hand  a national security concept based on the promotion and development of military alliances and nuclear deterrence policies seems better suited to the ideals that we pursue. The Central African Republic welcomes the initiative of United States President Obama in convening a meeting of the Security Council on nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament.  Terrorism is the most flagrant violation of international law. It prevents people from enjoying their basic freedoms and destabilizes legitimately established Governments. For those reasons  it must not be tolerated by or associated with any religion  civilization  ethnic group or claim  however legitimate it may seem. My country resolutely condemns terrorist acts and aligns itself with the fight against terrorism being carried out by the committees established by the United Nations Security Council.  The issue of the control of conventional weapons at the regional level is all the more relevant in view of the fact that it is the most effective way to tackle the illegal proliferation of armed groups and transnational crime. The peace and security of Central Africa are hampered by that recurrent problem. Armed groups threaten the stability of the national institutions of some of our States. Along those lines  the comprehensive peace agreement signed at Libreville in neighbouring Gabon on 21 June 2008 enabled the Central African Republic to thwart an ill-intentioned plot to seize power.  However  its concern  like that of other States of Africa’s Great Lakes region  such as the Sudan  the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Uganda  is with the criminal activities of the uprising of the so-called Lord’s Resistance Army  which has become a transnational criminal organization  causing death and destruction as far as the Central African Republic. Its destructive capacity goes beyond the territory of the Republic of Uganda and is becoming a regional problem  for which an agreed solution is essential. The affected States are striving to achieve that with the limited resources that they have.  I am convinced that the Charter of the United Nations and international law continue to be essential instruments and the pillars of the preservation and maintenance of international peace and security. Representing nearly the entire international community  the United Nations has well-established international legitimacy and is the best forum for finding a lasting solution to problems of that kind.   The United Nations remains the primary and fundamental forum for addressing world issues and seeking consensus. That is why we Member States attach great importance to strengthening its role and believe that reform is necessary in order to develop its full potential. The reform must be comprehensive and cover all areas  while respecting its political nature and its intergovernmental and universal character.  However  adjustments to two organs of our Organization seem to be a priority in that reform: the Security Council and the General Assembly. The General Assembly must be invigorated by giving greater weight to its role and to its authority as the main deliberative and representative organ of the Member States. The General Assembly’s prerogatives as the chief oversight body of the United Nations  even in the area of peacekeeping  must be respected.  As for reform of the Security Council  it must be directed at achieving transparency and balance within that body. Its enlargement will enable better representation of all regions in order to allow us to debate new approaches to the maintenance of international peace and security. This is an African position that has been advocated during this general debate by the Leader of the Great Socialist People’s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya (see )  and it is one that the Central African Republic supports. My country hopes that reform of the United Nations system will    09-52470 40  have a positive impact on the development of multilateral cooperation in our ever-changing world. "
"30",1222,"CAN",64,2009,"The establishment of the United Nations came about through the fundamental recognition of our interdependence as peoples and nations. Canada was among its founding members  who were inspired at the time by the need to create an international consensus for the stability and security of a world ravaged by war  more than 60 years ago. There is therefore no more appropriate forum than this one for me  as Minister for Foreign Affairs of Canada  to reaffirm my country’s    09-52592 46  commitment to collective action  namely  to work together with all countries to pursue shared objectives and overcome common challenges.  The global economic and financial crisis  as well as the global security and environmental threats facing us  have underscored the extent of that interdependence. We have placed economic recovery and growth at the top of our priorities and have taken decisive action in Canada to mitigate the impact of the crisis on all Canadians.  However  the recovery of Canada’s economy cannot happen in isolation from economic recovery across the world. Moreover  protectionism is a common threat to all of the world’s economies. History has taught us that we cannot hope to emerge from the current crisis if we impede global trade in an effort to protect our national economies. We therefore need vigorous and effective consultation at the highest levels so that we can work together to resist the protectionist urge.  Since the establishment of the United Nations  more than 100 000 Canadians have served in United Nations missions in Africa  the Americas  the Asia-Pacific region and the Middle East. Today  thousands of others — soldiers  police  diplomats  aid workers and others — are working in support of missions led or mandated by the United Nations around the world.  Eradicating terrorism in all its forms is the responsibility both of Canadians and of the United Nations. Indeed  Canada is committed to combating terrorism and to ensuring that the perpetrators and supporters of terrorism are held accountable for their actions. The Taliban in particular are a threat to global peace and security. Like the United Nations  Canada is determined to eradicate that threat.  Our mission in Afghanistan is the most vivid illustration of Canada’s determination to that end. It also constitutes our most significant overseas contribution. Canada’s mission is an efficient  integrated  civilian-military partnership of approximately 2 800 military personnel and more than 100 civilians. Those Canadians are working tirelessly and making great sacrifices in support of the United Nations-mandated Mission to reconstitute a stable and secure Afghanistan that is at last led by Afghans themselves.  In the months ahead  Canada will expect Afghan political leaders to make progress on key priorities — from good governance to anti-corruption efforts and from reconciliation to reconstruction  economic growth and regional cooperation  so as to promote stability in their country. As they tackle the many challenges ahead  they must ensure that their efforts promote  protect and improve human rights in a concrete manner  in particular the rights and living conditions of Afghan women and girls.  Canada is also providing significant assistance to Haiti  where our contribution will total $555 million between 2006 and 2011. We aim to promote democracy  security and economic growth and  above all  to secure a better future for all of Haiti’s children and young people.  Many other challenges remain. Canada regrets the deteriorating security situation in southern Sudan  and we call for the full implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement. Along the same lines  we encourage all parties to the Darfur conflict to end hostilities through the joint mediation of the United Nations and the African Union. Canada is determined to contribute to resolving the conflict in the Sudan. Since 2006  we have disbursed more than $640 million in support of international efforts to achieve sustainable peace in that country.  We are all acutely conscious that nuclear proliferation is a global threat we all face. Canada was deeply troubled by the recent revelation that Iran has been building a covert uranium enrichment facility for several years. We condemn Iran’s continued refusal to respect Security Council resolutions and International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) obligations. We therefore call on Iran to allow the IAEA immediate and unfettered access to all sites  including that facility. We expect a full investigation.  We hope that talks between Iran and the five permanent members of the Security Council plus Germany that are scheduled for 1 October will address the continued duplicity surrounding Iran’s nuclear programme. Prime Minister Stephen Harper of Canada has been clear in his discussions with President Obama  Prime Minister Brown  President Sarkozy and our other allies. Canada will welcome the efforts deemed necessary to remove what is clearly a threat to international peace and security.  In that regard  Canada commended President Obama for having taken the initiative to organize a summit meeting of the Security Council on the issue of non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament (see S/PV.6191). We commit ourselves to working with other countries to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and   47 09-52592  new terrorist threats. However  finding a diplomatic solution to those problems will require that we mobilize political will to ensure that every country adheres to the vision of a world free of nuclear weapons. (spoke in English)  At this time of the year in my country  the leaves on the trees are changing colours. That dramatic display reminds all Canadians of the need to protect our natural heritage  which is one of the most majestic in the world. But neither borders nor seasons can stop the havoc caused by climate change. Canada therefore remains committed to an ambitious post-2012 global climate change agreement that is consistent with the principles and provisions of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and supports sustainable  low-carbon global growth.  We are committed to taking domestic actions to reduce our total greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent from 2006 levels by the year 2020  and by 60 to 70 per cent by 2050. Canada is a world leader in the development of clean technologies to combat climate change  including carbon capture and storage. We seek to establish a new global partnership that will advance the development and deployment of those technologies.  Canada joined other countries at the L’Aquila meeting of the Group of Eight (G-8) and at the Major Economies Forum in affirming the broad scientific view that the increase in global average temperature above pre-industrial levels ought not to exceed two degrees Celsius.  This global phenomenon needs a global response. That is why Canada wants to see all emitters be part of this international effort. We congratulate the Secretary-General for convening his productive Climate Change Summit  as well as for assuming the leadership that naturally falls to the United Nations in this area. All major economies will be required to meet this global challenge. This must be reflected in the context of a fair  equitable and effective agreement at Copenhagen in December.  Adaptation to the impacts of climate change is an important issue for all countries. It must be a core element of a post-2012 climate change regime if we are to build resilience to climate change impacts. Canada has contributed significantly to a number of initiatives  including the World Bank’s Pilot Program for Climate Resilience. We continue to support international action that strengthens the capacity of the poorest and most vulnerable to adapt to a changing climate.  As an Arctic State and Power  Canada is proud of its long-standing sovereignty over that increasingly promising territory. Canada also recognizes the important responsibility that we have to Northerners and to the sustainable development and environmental protection of the region. Cooperation with our Arctic neighbours and the peaceful pursuit of our interests has underpinned and will continue to underpin Canada’s arctic foreign policy and to guide our actions in the region. Through our bilateral and multilateral engagement — whether at the United Nations and the Arctic Council or in working with our Arctic partners — Canada will continue to show leadership on such Arctic issues as shipping  oil and gas and contaminants and biodiversity.  Since the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  61 years ago  Canada has worked vigorously to strengthen the United Nations human rights machinery to ensure the credibility and integrity of fair and balanced mechanisms to promote human rights and fundamental freedoms. Human rights are an important part of Canadian foreign policy and our relations with Member States. During our recently completed term on the Human Rights Council  Canada worked to make it a forum for constructive international dialogue. We will continue to work towards building an efficient  responsive and credible Human Rights Council that is true to its founding principles. Canada will also continue to promote respect for basic human rights and the freedom of expression and association. And we will continue to advocate for those unjustly detained in the world’s most abusive regimes.  Finding the political will to translate our values into actions and ensuring that we continue to hold to account those who would violate basic human rights is in the interest of all Member States. Supporting those who are making sincere efforts to advance the human rights of their populations is also one of our collective objectives.  Canada is meeting its international commitments. We are on track to double our international assistance to $5 billion by 2010. We have also already met our commitment to double aid to Africa between 2003 and 2009. Canada will also continue to provide humanitarian assistance to those affected by conflict and natural disasters.    09-52592 48   Through Canada’s chairmanship of the Sierra Leone country-specific configuration of the Peacebuilding Commission  we are working to bridge the gap between humanitarian assistance and long-term development. As Chair of the G-8 in 2010  Canada will place emphasis on making the G-8 more accountable and effective. Accountability means fulfilling our commitments. Effectiveness is about strengthening our partnerships  including with the United Nations  to tackle challenges such as the fragility of States and nuclear non-proliferation. Canada will also co-host the summit of the Group of 20 (G-20) in June 2010  along with our good friend the Republic of Korea.  Our priority will remain economic recovery and building the foundation for sustainable growth  including for the most vulnerable. Earlier this week  Prime Minister Stephen Harper announced a concrete and innovative contribution to that effort. Building on our previous G-20 commitments  Canada will provide the African Development Bank with approximately $2.6 billion in additional lending room. That will assist the Bank in responding quickly to the demands of its borrowing members while it continues its poverty reduction efforts.  I would urge representatives not to let the dizzying succession of major events addressed here cause them to lose sight of the importance of reforming the Security Council. The Council is our most powerful means of collective action. But we can  and indeed we must  make it more effective  more accessible and more flexible — more adapted  in fact  to the challenges and opportunities of the broader international community.  Canada has long supported efforts to make the Security Council more responsive to today’s security challenges and more representative of the world’s regions  in particular Africa  which has been historically underrepresented. Any real reform must lead to increased transparency and accountability. That will not be achieved by extending the privileges of a few to a few more  but through democratically elected access to the Security Council and through more consultation with and openness to the wider membership of the United Nations.  In conclusion  this small reminder of the responsibility we all bear for our citizens’ economic  environmental and nuclear security can leave us perplexed or even worried. But what we must never forget is that  in this seemingly uneven battle  we have in our arsenal the most effective weapons ever devised by humankind  namely  freedom  democracy  human rights and the rule of law."
"31",1237,"CHE",64,2009,"We look back on a year that has been exceptional in so many respects. Twelve months ago  a bank only a few hundred metres away from here collapsed and brought the global financial system to the verge of breakdown. The ensuing turbulence in the finance sector led to a severe global economic downturn.  This illustrates the interconnectedness of our world. It reminds us that other issues  such as climate change  the food crisis  migration  pandemics  terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction are not confined by national borders. Rising to these global challenges requires determined and coordinated action at the national  regional and international levels. International cooperation has become vital. The United Nations is the place where this cooperation happens. Today  the world needs the United Nations more than ever.  The United Nations should continue along its path of reform in order to reinforce its legitimacy. At the same time  exchanges between the United Nations and other forums such as the Group of 20 (G-20) — which is meeting today — must be strengthened. The G-20 has taken over a role in discussing important global issues. This development must not take place at the expense of other nations or global institutions such as the United Nations. The G-20 lacks legitimacy; basic considerations of due process are absent in the sanctions procedures. The members of the G-20 themselves are not subject to the same scrutiny. Switzerland advocates a level playing field.  The financial and economic crisis continues to be of concern to all of us. Governments and central banks have put together vast stabilization packages. However  quantity is not everything. What counts is quality. Economic activity must revert to fundamental values and virtues. It must focus on economic  social and environmental sustainability. Through institutions such as the International Monetary Fund  the World Bank and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)  the United Nations has the knowledge and the instruments needed to combat the financial and economic crisis. It is important to ensure that the voices of these institutions too be heard within the G-20.  The present crisis has occasionally been used in some quarters as an opportunity to question the market economy and  indeed  globalization. I do not dispute that reform is necessary. The failures and abuses have been too big to ignore. Nevertheless  we must remind ourselves that it is also thanks to a liberal economic order and open markets that much of the world’s population has been lifted out of poverty. Here  we share the concerns of those who believe that the current growing trend towards protectionism will lead us straight towards disaster. My country therefore welcomes the call made at the United Nations World Conference on the Financial and Economic Crisis for the swift conclusion of the Doha Round.  People in the developing countries have been hit particularly hard by the financial and economic crisis. There is a significant risk that the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals will be delayed. As for   09-52320 24  Switzerland  we have pledged to maintain our level of development aid despite stringent budget constraints. Developing and developed countries are jointly responsible for achieving the Millennium Development Goals. Next year  the United Nations conference marking the tenth anniversary of the Millennium Declaration will provide us with the opportunity to reinvigorate this partnership and to improve the effectiveness of development aid.  Sustainable development must also be our guiding principle in the fight against climate change. This is why the climate conference in Copenhagen must be a success. Switzerland wants and is able to set a good example. We will achieve our CO2 reduction targets for 2012. For the period until 2020  we are prepared to cut our CO2 emissions by 20 per cent. At the global level  the costs of adaptation to climate change will amount to several tens of billions of dollars per year of which more than half will be at the expense of developing countries. Switzerland has therefore proposed the creation of a global carbon tax which is based on the polluter-pays principle  in order to deal with these emerging needs.  Violent conflicts continue to plague the planet  rendering a life in dignity  peace and security elusive for too many people. The unique legitimacy of the United Nations allows it to play an active role in conflict prevention  mediation  the protection of civilians  peacekeeping and peacebuilding. My country welcomes the greater involvement of the United Nations in these areas and especially advocates the strengthening of United Nations prevention and mediation capacities. Switzerland is also active in the area of peacebuilding. It has taken over the chairmanship of the Peacebuilding Commission’s country-specific configuration on Burundi and will continue its initiative on armed violence and development.  This year we celebrate the sixtieth anniversary of the Geneva Conventions. Since their creation  the Geneva Conventions have set indispensable rules for situations of armed conflict. New forms of armed conflict and new means and methods of warfare make it increasingly difficult to ensure respect for these rules. It is unacceptable that civilian populations should be so often the target of deliberate attacks and that humanitarian aid personnel should be so often denied rapid and unimpeded access to populations in need.   In an effort to identify ways of improving compliance with the Geneva Conventions  Switzerland is organizing a ministerial side event on Saturday here in New York. In November we will hold an international conference of experts in Geneva  open to all State parties to the Geneva Conventions. The conference will focus on the current and future challenges faced by international humanitarian law.  Human dignity is an inalienable right of all human beings  regardless of their gender  origin or religion. The Human Rights Council is the principal forum for discussing human rights within the United Nations. Both its special procedures and its universal periodic review process have demonstrated their effectiveness. This said  a great many challenges remain. Switzerland will continue to work vigorously for an effective Human Rights Council and will present its candidacy for a second term starting in 2010.   The protection of human rights  along with the promotion of democracy and the strengthening of the rule of law will also be priorities of the Swiss presidency of the Council of Europe from November 2009 to May 2010. Under the Swiss presidency  efforts will be made to increase cooperation between the United Nations and the Council of Europe.  2010 will thus be a symbolic year for the United Nations. Five years will have passed since the adoption of the 2005 World Summit Outcome Document and ten years since the signing of the Millennium Declaration. Next year’s summit will be an opportunity to assess the status of implementation of these declarations and to initiate new  more comprehensive reforms. These are necessary steps because only a reformed United Nations will be in a position to find appropriate responses to the global challenges.   In this context  it is my great pleasure to announce to Member States that Switzerland has put forward the candidature of Joseph Deiss  former President of the Swiss Confederation  for the presidency of the sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly.  I will conclude with the following: the challenges to be met are huge  however we must not yield to pessimism. Throughout history  human beings have demonstrated time and again that with courage  imagination and persistence they are capable of great achievements. The Swiss writer Max Frisch once said: “A crisis can be a productive state. You just have to get   25 09-52320  rid of the aftertaste of disaster.” I absolutely agree. So let us be productive and seize the opportunity to create a prosperous  just  peaceful and sustainable world."
"32",1283,"CHL",64,2009,"For the past four years  I have been proud to represent my country in this Assembly  the world’s foremost assembly  the forum in which the peoples have placed so many hopes. Peace  human rights  international law  development: these are some of the causes promoted here  sometimes successfully and at other times with difficulty  but always with progress. This has been observed by the poorest in various regions; it has been observed by children and women; it has been observed by the persecuted  by those who suffer; it has been observed by men and women all over the globe.  It is true that the efforts have not sufficed to eradicate all the injustice or the abuses or the sorrows of so many. But it is also true that we have made considerable progress in six decades of international collaboration. The rule of law and the institutional framework have been strengthened  so that humanity today has the technical  legal and economic means to make much more progress in the struggle for a better world.  We cannot let those hopes be dashed. But at times this is what we seem to be doing. The world is experiencing a serious economic crisis resulting from the inability of countries and of the international community to formulate clear and transparent rules on financial matters.  We are on the brink of a serious environmental crisis resulting from emissions of greenhouse gases and from the way the world has chosen to produce and obtain energy — as well as from the inability of countries to agree on standards and policies to prevent global warming.  Even more serious  in the twenty-first century we see more than a billion people suffering from hunger: one out of six people all over the world  50 million of them in Latin America. This is much more than a statistic: it is a child  it is a mother dying in a poor county despite the opulence in which the developed countries are living.  Trillions of dollars have been spent in recent months to rescue the financial system and revitalize the economy. Yet the World Food Programme will see its budget reduced by more than half this year. What a sad paradox this is. Less than 0.1 per cent of the financial rescue plans would end the food crisis affecting dozens of countries. I should like today to raise my voice and urge that this item be put on the agenda of this Assembly  the forthcoming meetings of the Group of 20 and  in general  all international forums.  The economic collapse must not lead to a social collapse. We must not let down our guard  for it is not acceptable that  on the pretext of the economic crisis  countries should be reducing contributions for the fight against hunger  for the protection of the environment or for the promotion of development.  And it is ethically untenable that  while this is happening  the executives of the investment banks that were at the centre of the current crisis  gambling irresponsibly with financial assets  should today be back to business as usual and awarding themselves huge bonuses which simply reward excessive risk-taking in their bets. They are even considering establishing companies to place their bonuses in tax havens.  The world simply cannot function in this way. Resignation is not an option. It is possible to construct fairer  realistic  sustainable and pragmatic models to    09-52179 36  ensure progressive advancement for all peoples. That requires recognition that the economic crisis was not a casual occurrence or  still less  a cyclical event in the capitalist economy that will correct itself on its own  solely through the workings of the invisible hand of the market.  What happened here was much more than a chance occurrence or a cycle. What happened here was the crisis of a paradigm  the crisis of a certain kind of globalization  the crisis of a conception of the State and the public sector in which the State is seen as the problem and not the solution. In this conception  it is thought that the more the economy is deregulated  the better it is. In this conception there are misgivings about democratic discussion as to which goods should be public and should therefore enjoy efficient protection and government guarantees.  It is this extreme and dogmatic neo-liberalism that has unfortunately erupted into crisis  unfortunately leaving in its wake a trail of hunger  unemployment and  above all  injustice.  And it is at times like this that action by the public sector has proved to be essential. Thanks to decisive action by States  it has been possible to avoid a widespread and fatal economic collapse with unexpected political consequences — which could have been another Great Depression.  The whole dogma of laissez-faire was forgotten when the time came for the State to save the international financial machinery and implement financial stimulus plans.  In some countries — including my own — State action proved crucial in mitigating effects and protecting the most vulnerable in crisis situations. In my country  we were careful with commodity wealth some years ago and saved resources for more difficult times  resisting political pressure to spend that money but confident that this was the responsible thing to do. We were proved to be right  and this has allowed us to offset the effects of the international crisis while increasing social benefits for people  raising pensions  protecting workers  building hospitals and investing more than ever before in education and housing for those most in need.  Countries such as Chile learned the lessons of past crises and are facing this crisis with solid macroeconomic foundations  with far better capitalized banking systems and with stricter and more effective regulations.  But this was not the case everywhere. It is worth recalling that after the Asian crisis a decade ago  there was much talk about financial system reforms  better oversight mechanisms and early warning systems. But none of this happened. Political laziness prevailed. Private interests prevailed over the public good. That is why today reform cannot wait  either domestically  with better regulations in the capital market  or abroad.  We hope that General Assembly resolutions and the forthcoming meeting of the Group of 20 will make progress in this direction because — I insist — resignation is not an option. We know that at this stage neither rhetoric nor populism can be of help. There must be no flights of fancy  and we must remain open to the opportunities that well conducted globalization can provide.  We must find effective mechanisms to safeguard the public interest in the world of national and international finance. We must find solutions to unlock a world trade agreement that will thwart protectionist designs. And we must return multilateral dialogue to the centre of international policy  abandoning unilateralism.  While unbridled globalization in the financial sphere provoked the crisis we are experiencing  unilateral action and disdain for institutions resulted in conflicts that must not be repeated. Military or economic might cannot be the norm in international relations. Institutions and the rule of law must prevail  since this is the only way to ensure peace and development.  Thus  Chile strongly supports the reform and strengthening of the United Nations. We support the Organization’s recent efforts in the areas of human rights  development and climate change. We favour reform and enlargement of the Security Council. We welcome the important work being done by the Peacebuilding Commission to provide support from the outset to countries emerging from conflict — support that is comprehensive  not only military.  That is the logic that should prevail in all spheres. We want the United Nations to spearhead a new global social covenant  we want the Millennium Development Goals to be attained by 2015 and we want to see   37 09-52179  forceful and decisive involvement to mitigate climate change.  We have spoken about climate change at special meetings during this session. Today I wish simply to sound the alarm. Unless we coordinate efforts at the highest level  the forthcoming Copenhagen Conference will not attain its goal. We risk failure on what is the most urgent cause to be taken up by the world at this time when the scientific forecasts made by the Intergovernmental Panel in 2007 already seem to fall short of the mark.  Climate change is not a theory; it is a tangible reality that we are witnessing in unusual storms  floods and droughts. My country  which is so close to Antarctica  is watching in amazement as melting of the glaciers and ice platforms on that continent accelerates at an inexorable pace.  The industrialized countries must adopt quantifiable goals for more ambitious emission reductions than those that now exist. If they assume their historical responsibility with deeds  and not only words  and if they undertake to provide the necessary technological and financial support  then the developing world will be able to make an even greater effort to meet this challenge.  We thus have the possibility to correct the course of our future. Let us not use the economic crisis as an excuse for not reaching an agreement that all our citizens are demanding. Let us today ensure the future of our descendants. We have a huge responsibility. For this reason  let us lay the foundations this year  in Copenhagen  for a new economy that will allow the twenty-first century to be an era of progress.  If there is one lesson that we can learn from the economic crisis and from the environmental crisis  it is that the quality of policy matters. Neither the world nor countries are governed on automatic pilot  trailing behind the market  trailing behind globalization  trailing behind social changes. The policy of quality has a positive impact on the well-being of individuals.  The rule of law  civil liberties and respect for human rights are all prerequisites for a democracy of quality. There is no longer any justification for violating the principle of liberty and democracy in the name of justice or equality. Procedural democracy is part of the ethical and political common property of the international community in the twenty-first century. And little by little  we have started to reinforce this principle at the level of nations.  My region  Latin America  has been able gradually to build a single vision  which has enabled it  for example  to come rapidly to the aid of any threatened democracy  as was the case in Bolivia one year ago  or to strongly condemn democratic setbacks  such as occurred in Honduras a few months ago. For this reason  today  with President Zelaya — who has peacefully returned to Honduras — I wish to reiterate our appeal for immediate acceptance of the San José agreement promoted by the Organization of American States. Honduras deserves free and democratic elections  with the constitutional President leading this process.  It is thus clear that policy is now more important than ever. Let us make an effort to restore it to its rightful place  but  of course  with the quality that citizens deserve.  What has happened with the crisis  with the environment  with hunger  with conflicts  is the result of a lack of adequate leadership and political dialogue. It is for us  leaders of our countries  to change this situation. It is within our power  first  not to resign ourselves to the market or to force and  secondly  to avoid demagogy by trying to construct a fairer order for our peoples through serious and responsible public policies  in an environment of full democracy and respect for human rights.  This can be the basis for a global social covenant  which the world is insistently demanding at this difficult time. We must not fail the world."
"33",1329,"CHN",64,2009,"The world today is undergoing major developments  major changes and major adjustments. The trend towards peace  development and cooperation  which represents the call of our times  has grown stronger than ever. As the world moves further towards multipolarity and economic globalization  multilateralism and democracy in international relations have won greater popular support  while openness and cooperation for mutual benefit and win-win progress have become the shared aspirations of the international community. Countries have become more interdependent.  At the same time  the world remains in the grip of the financial crisis  and the prospects for economic recovery are still not clear. Worldwide  unemployment and poverty are worsening  and development imbalances are more acute. Global issues such as climate change  food security  energy and resource security  and public health security have been thrown into sharp relief. Non-traditional security threats  including terrorism  the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction  transnational organized crime and major communicable diseases  are threatening our world. Some long-standing hotspot issues remain unresolved  while regional and local conflicts continue to flare up. The instability and uncertainties on the international landscape pose severe challenges to world peace and development.  In the face of unprecedented opportunities and challenges  we members of the international community should commit ourselves to peace  development  cooperation  common progress and tolerance  and continue our joint endeavour to build a harmonious world of enduring peace and common prosperity and contribute to the noble cause of the peace and development of humankind.  First  we should view security in a broader perspective and safeguard world peace and stability. The security of all countries has never been as closely interconnected as it is today. Security is not a zero-sum game  and there is no isolated or absolute security. No country can be safe and stable in the absence of world and regional peace and stability.  We should embrace a new security mindset of mutual trust  mutual benefit  equality and coordination. While maintaining our own national security  we should also respect the security concerns of other countries and advance the common security of humankind. We should adhere to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and seek peaceful solutions to regional hotspot issues and international disputes. There should be no wilful use or threat of force. We should support the United Nations in continuing to play an important role in the field of international security. We should oppose terrorism  separatism and extremism in all their manifestations and broaden international security cooperation.  China has consistently stood for the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons and for a world without nuclear weapons. We call on the international community to take credible steps to push forward the nuclear disarmament process  eradicate the risks of nuclear weapons proliferation and promote the peaceful use of nuclear energy and related international cooperation.  Secondly  we should take a more holistic approach to development and promote common prosperity. Increasing economic globalization has linked the development of all countries closely together. Without the development and equal participation of developing countries  there can be neither common prosperity in the world nor a more just and equitable international economic order. The developing countries now face a deteriorating external environment brought about by the international financial crisis. Their economies are slowing down  and their development endeavours are beset by serious difficulties.  We believe that common development is an important way to redress global development imbalances and achieve sustainable development. The United Nations should increase its input in   9 09-52228  development; advance economic globalization in the direction of balanced development  shared benefits and win-win progress; and foster an international environment conducive to the development of developing countries. The international financial institutions should use their newly increased resources  first and foremost  to help developing countries move out of poverty and provide loans to them in a more flexible  diverse  convenient and efficient manner. Great effort should be made to increase the representation and voice of developing countries in the process of reforming the international financial system.  We should take responsible measures to counter the international financial crisis  firmly oppose protectionism and actively work for an early  comprehensive and balanced outcome of the Doha Round negotiations. Developed countries should open their markets to developing countries and reduce or exempt tariffs for those countries. They should honour their official development assistance and debt relief commitments and  in particular  increase assistance to the least developed countries  with a focus on tackling such issues as hunger  health care and education.   For developing countries  self-reliance is essential. They should explore development models conducive to their development and poverty eradication efforts. It is also in their interest to increase trade and investment cooperation  open markets to one another and step up South-South cooperation.  Thirdly  we should pursue cooperation with a more open mind and work for mutual benefit and common progress. Climate change  food security  energy and resource security  and public health security are all global challenges  and no country is immune to them. The only way for us to meet those challenges and ensure harmony and peace is to engage in closer international cooperation.   Climate change is one of the serious challenges to human survival and development  and international cooperation is the key to tackling that challenge. We should retain the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and its Kyoto Protocol as the main channel in addressing climate change  abide by the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities  adhere to the mandate of the Bali Road Map  and work for the success of the Copenhagen conference with a view to achieving mutual benefit and common progress.  Food and energy are vital to the livelihood  development and stability of all nations. We should increase our input into agriculture  develop advanced technologies  curb market speculation  increase food assistance and intensify cooperation with regard to agriculture and food. We should strengthen mutually beneficial cooperation in the area of energy  step up the research and development of new and renewable energies  put in place a system for the research  development and dissemination of advanced energy technologies  and diversify the energy supply.  The continued spread of influenza A — H1N1 — has presented a global public health challenge confronting the entire international community. China is ready to provide help  within its capacities  to other developing countries in the prevention and control of influenza A.  Fourthly  we should be more tolerant towards one another and live together in harmony. Mutual learning and tolerance among different civilizations are an inexhaustible source of strength for social progress  and all countries — large or small  strong or weak  rich or poor — are equal. We should acknowledge differences in our cultural traditions  social systems and values  respect the right of all countries to independently choose their own development paths  let different civilizations and models of development draw on one another’s strengths through competition and comparison  and achieve common development by seeking common ground while reserving the right to differ.   The Chinese people will soon celebrate the sixtieth anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China. Sixty years ago  the Chinese people won independence and liberation after a prolonged  hard struggle and became masters of the new China. Today  China’s national strength has grown remarkably and the people are better off.  China’s development has contributed greatly to peace and development in the world  and China’s future is more closely interconnected with that of the world. A more developed China will make greater contributions and bring more opportunities to the world. We are committed to the path of peaceful development and the win-win strategy of opening up. We will develop friendly relations and cooperation with all countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. China has always been and will    09-52228 10  continue to be a positive force for world peace and common development.  As a responsible and major developing country  China has always made common development an important aspect of its foreign policy. We have made a great effort to provide support and assistance to other developing countries. To further assist them  China will adopt the following measures.  First  we will increase support for other developing countries hit hard by the financial crisis  honestly implement relevant capital increase and financing plans  intensify trade and investment cooperation and help increase the capacity of relevant countries for risk resistance and sustainable development.   Secondly  we will continue to implement the measures announced at the United Nations High-level Event on the Millennium Development Goals to assist other developing countries in accelerating development and facilitating attainment of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).  Thirdly  China will follow through on the measures to help African countries that were announced at the Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation  increase assistance to Africa  reduce or cancel debts for African countries  expand trade and investment  provide human resources and technological support for African countries in such areas as agriculture  health  education and disaster preparedness and reduction  and intensify personnel training tailored to African needs.  Fourthly  China will continue to participate in and promote regional monetary and financial cooperation  maintain financial and economic stability and promote financial cooperation and trade in the region.  Let us join hands  share the development opportunities  rise above the challenges and make an unremitting effort towards building a harmonious world of enduring peace and common prosperity."
"34",1363,"CIV",64,2009,"As I take the floor for the first time at the present session  allow me to join all of those who preceded me at this rostrum in congratulating Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki and telling him how proud we are to see him presiding over the General Assembly at the sixty-fourth session. His election testifies to his personal qualities and is a tribute to the African Union.   I applaud our Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon. He has kept the United Nations on track and strengthened the United Nations in the context of the multiple crises affecting the world.  Two years ago  from this very rostrum  I updated the Assembly on the crisis in my country  Côte d’Ivoire. At that time  I welcomed the important role played by regional organizations  such as the African Union and the Economic Community of West African States. I particularly dwelt on the internal processes that brought us  the Government and former rebels  to commit to a process of peace that ended the conflict and led to the current preparations for general elections. All through that process  we enjoyed from the support of the United Nations  notably through the United Nations Operation in Côte d’Ivoire. We benefited even more from the assistance of the President of Burkina Faso  Mr. Blaise Compaore.  Thanks to the efforts of all  and particularly to the Ivorians’ hard work and desire for peace  the process has now entered into a irreversible phase. Today  there are no remaining political obstacles to the holding of the elections. I take this opportunity to express once again the gratitude of Côte d’Ivoire to the United Nations and to all our friends for their commitment to the restoration of peace.  I would also like to share our desire to do our utmost to end the crisis via the ballot box. We are all the more resolute given that the challenges facing today’s world require of all States  and in particular small States such as ours  a political strategy based on democracy. Thus armed  we will be able not only to effectively address our current difficulties  but also to contribute to the understanding of and resolution of international crises.  This is what President Treki has called on us to do through the theme of this sixty-fourth session of the General Assembly  “Effective responses to global crises: strengthening multilateralism and dialogue among civilizations for international peace  security and development”.  We note that  in addition to recurrent political crises  the acute crises facing the world today affect the stability of nations and jeopardize our shared future. In 2008  the energy crisis reached unprecedented proportions. The price of a barrel of oil  it will be recalled  rose to nearly $150. That major crisis took place alongside a food crisis and an unprecedented financial crisis that soon turned into a deep economic crisis. The entire world woke up to the threat posed to social and political equilibrium by the three crises that struck at the same time. These crises shook all our certainties and caused a wave of panic. They showed us in no uncertain terms that nothing can ever be taken for granted  even in big countries.  The entire world mobilized to meet the challenge  both within individual countries and within international institutions and organizations. We saw the International Monetary Fund provide assistance to countries that are not usually the recipients of such aid  such as those of northern Europe. This exceptional mobilization points to the concern of the international community at seeing the situation end in uncontrollable social and political crises.  However  although the mobilization and cooperation were multilateral  the crisis resolution    09-52463 12  plans were not. Countries in North America  Europe and Asia adopted national plans. This shows that there are limits to multilateralism and that nation States protect their prerogatives and shoulder their full responsibilities at the economic level  when necessary.  I note  moreover  that the mobilization in Africa and for Africa was quite diffident. It was as though the financial crisis was not also an African crisis  or as if the financial sector in Africa was not sufficiently integrated into the international financial system. Perhaps our continent did not grasp the full extent of the crisis. And yet  the financial crisis has had consequences on the African continent. In Africa  perhaps more than anywhere else  the financial crisis became an economic crisis that underscored the economic and social fragility of our countries.  The lesson we draw from that experience is that no country is immune to crisis. This requires the international community to enhance its vigilance by increasing oversight of the financial system and its institutions at the international level. It would also be timely for us to embark on a reform of the international monetary and financial system. In this context  United Nations reform  and above all reform of its organs  is essential if the United Nations is to play a solid leading role in strengthening multilateralism.   Among the cross-cutting issues in which the United Nations must play a key role are the resurgence of extremism. The entrenchment and hardening of positions are prevailing over dialogue and deepening the chasm between cultures that need to live together in harmony. Hence  the importance of the historic high-level meeting convened in this very Hall on 12 and 13 November 2008 on the urgent need for genuine dialogue among religions with a view to creating a culture of peace. That initiative bolstered activities to raise the awareness of the international community to the need for preventive diplomacy on this key topic  in particular the World Conference on Dialogue  held in Madrid in July 2008  and the launching in July 2005 of the Alliance of Civilizations  under the auspices of the United Nations.  We therefore believe that all of these initiatives in favour of dialogue among cultures  as well as those to come  point to the need to establish a permanent forum for dialogue among civilizations so as to draw peoples together.  I now turn to world peace and security. The only sure way to attain lasting peace is the equitable settlement of conflicts within a reformed  more democratic and more credible Security Council. Together  we need to build a United Nations with a stronger mandate and greater representativity.  In that regard  it would be preferable to entrust the prevention  management and settlement of local conflicts to regional and even subregional organizations. That approach  which was enshrined in April 2008 by the Security Council  should be strengthened by an earnest updating of the mechanism for cooperation with regional organizations  as provided for in the United Nations Charter of 1945.  In that regard  I would like to simply reiterate here the position of my delegation  which is based on our experience of handling and settling the Ivorian crisis. Direct dialogue  like that in Côte d’Ivoire  offers avenues for thought that the United Nations could make good use of. I think that the Burkina Faso delegation can address that issue as well as  if not better than  we can.   Another topic of concern is world poverty. World peace and security are dependent on the eradication of extreme poverty and poverty reduction. That is why my delegation welcomes the convening at the sixty-third session of two high-level meetings on Africa’s development needs and the Millennium Development Goals. We welcome the outcomes and recommendations of those meetings.  Côte d’Ivoire is resolved to free itself of the burden of debt that is threatening its development goals. There have been meetings on debt  but there need to be more  and decisions must be taken on debt because the debts that were incurred in the 1960s  the 1970s and the 1980s today hamper the development of African countries. That must be considered. It is a law of nature that when a small  weak country is overburdened by debt  the original purpose of which is often not known even to its leaders  that country sinks  and drags the world down with it. Africa is part of the world. If a decision is not taken on the issue of the debt of African countries  the entire global financial system will be on course for disaster.   That is why I stress  alongside the problem of debt  the issue of climate change. We talk of climate change  and we are right to do so  but we need to take decisions that are critical for most of our countries. I   13 09-52463  do not know the situation in West Africa very well  but it has been shown that  in Central and Southern Africa  the deserts are advancing by two kilometres a year. What does that mean? It means that in 50 years the deserts will have advanced by 100 kilometres and reached the coasts. We must decide.  While the deserts advance  on the coasts villages and houses are disappearing into the sea. That is happening in Nigeria  Benin  Togo  Ghana  Côte d’Ivoire and elsewhere. There are people living today with the water at their feet. There are those who live not knowing if tomorrow it will reach their houses or if their houses will  in fact  be in the sea. Urgent measures are needed. We need not only meetings  but also decisions  and those decisions — on deserts  the sea and floods — must be implemented. Everywhere today — in Burkina Faso  Mali and Côte d’Ivoire — the rains bring disaster  and those very rains that we call for to water our farms have become a cause for alarm. We no longer know if the rains to come bring death or life.   Africa is fighting  and is doing so alone. It would prefer to fight with the rest of the world behind it. That is also why we have come to speak here. Africa no longer wishes to feel abandoned or to fight alone. Soon  in 50 years according to the experts  it will be easier to find oil than clean drinking water  because we will have to go a long way — too far for our economies.   What are we going to do? The issue of clean water has become a problem. Certainly  in some rich oil-producing countries in the Arab world  we have seen our brothers working to make seawater drinkable  but how many countries in the world have the means to turn seawater into drinking water? It is terribly expensive. We need to convene a meeting here at the United Nations on that issue — and not only meetings  but decisions followed by action.   Those are the problems that I came here to talk about on behalf of the Ivorian delegation. Everyone knows that Africa is such that when one delegation talks  it speaks for all delegations because we face the same problems. I would hope that  as of today  we can look beyond internal crises. We all know that Africa has made great progress. It is up to us to strengthen ourselves by daring to fight poverty  extreme poverty and catastrophic climate change. Climate change is dangerous throughout the world  but it is catastrophic for us. We need the help of representatives to tackle this difficult century before us. I pray that God may bless the United Nations."
"35",1406,"CMR",64,2009,"I would like to begin by extending my congratulations to Mr. Ali Treki on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at this sixty-fourth session and by wishing him every success in the execution of his term of office. Allow me also to pay tribute to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his tireless work and for the remarkable devotion that he has demonstrated at the helm of our Organization.  Like each year  we are asked during this session to look at the state of the world  to consider together the current problems and to recommend appropriate solutions to them. In that regard  as we know  the international community remains under the impact of a global financial and economic crisis that has spared no country.  The extraordinary mobilization that it has aroused reflects its scope and extent  as well as the gravity of the threat that it poses to the stability of the global economy. We must welcome that strong mobilization  led by the major industrialized countries. It was prompt  resolute and consistent. Without doubt  it has demonstrated the international community’s capacity to respond fully when it is driven and underpinned by real political resolve.  That is certainly a good example of solidarity  the kind of international solidarity that we seek and that we would like also to see in the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals  in our common concern to narrow the gap between the North and the South  and in our daily struggle against poverty  hunger and pandemics.  In other words  if we have been able to mobilize ourselves so vigorously to contain the effects of the financial crisis  we can do the same to address the other challenges confronting us  namely the poverty and underdevelopment in which so many human beings throughout the world still live. For  while the crisis has spared no continent  there is no doubt that its effects vary depending on the country  region and level of development.  Africa  in particular  which in no way contributed to the unleashing of the crisis  today  paradoxically  finds itself among the worst affected victims. Among the most alarming effects  we therefore condemn the decrease in remittances to our countries; the severe drop in the prices of our products; the marked fall in investment; worsening budget deficits; and the slowdown in economic activity — all of which  among other things  also have severe social consequences  such as a rise in unemployment. Furthermore  there is reason to fear that the continuation of the crisis will only increase the debt of developing countries.  We find ourselves facing new difficulties just as we are emerging from lengthy years of economic recovery efforts under rigorous structural adjustment programmes  resolutely implemented by our States in cooperation with the international financial institutions. Neither our efforts nor our sacrifices have been in vain  and we believe that our gains  which are the fruit of the commendable efforts of our peoples  must unquestionably be preserved and supported.  The President took the Chair.  That is why we believe that  faced with the harmful effects of the crisis  it is important that we all work together towards a global  coordinated and significant response for the benefit of the weakest economies. In our view  that response should lead to the provision of substantial financial resources free  as far as possible  of conditionality and aimed at mitigating or even compensating for the consequences of a crisis that we could not avert.  Without such support  our developing countries run the risk of seeing their economic activity decrease   15 09-52470  and the signs of the revival that they could reasonably hope for disappear. It is evident that  over and above development and improved living conditions  the peace and stability of our countries depend on it. That also holds true for international peace and security  inasmuch as the numerous problems confronting the world today — be it  for example  illegal immigration or trafficking of every kind — arise partly from a real lack of cooperation and solidarity  and thus call for greater justice in international relations.  In that connection  I welcome the fortuitous decision taken in London in April by the Group of 20 to recommend that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) support the weakest economies through more and softer loans  possibly with less conditionality. Moreover  in that context  my country  Cameroon  benefited from substantial financial support from the IMF under the Exogenous Shocks Facility. I welcome that support  and take this opportunity to thank International Monetary Fund officials. That timely support will strengthen the anticyclical measures that we have adopted at the national and subregional levels  fully aware that foreign aid is merely a buttress that should not replace our own efforts.   Accordingly  in Cameroon  we have  inter alia  strengthened the productive sectors and taken action to reduce the prices of basic commodities and improve the business climate. In the subregion  member countries of the Central African Economic and Monetary Community have agreed to adopt tax incentives and to establish a support fund for the sectors most affected by the crisis. Thus  while welcoming assistance from the international community  we are aware that it can bear fruit only if based on stringent management and good governance centred on the primacy of the public interest.   Moreover  it was in that spirit that a few years back I recommended from this rostrum the establishment within the United Nations of a global ethics committee  for it is a combination of moral drift and serious ethical deviations that is at the root of the current global financial crisis. We trust that  in the near future  we will surmount the crisis through collective awareness and mobilization.   However  alongside with the financial and economic crisis  we are concerned about other important matters. The food crisis is still ravaging many developing countries. The poverty reduction struggle is far from being won. Global peace and security are still threatened worldwide  particularly in Africa. Climate change is each day becoming increasingly worrisome  with visible consequences in every country.   Regarding climate change in particular  Africa  like other continents  has been hard hit despite its low level of greenhouse gas emissions. Global warming  its most salient feature  affects many socio-economic sectors  including energy  health  agriculture  livestock production  ecosystems and rapid desertification. In this regard  the spectacular drying up of Lake Chad  the surface of which has shrunk from 26 000 square kilometres in the 1960s to 1 500 square kilometres today  clearly requires significant collective action of the Central African States which  in our opinion  needs strong support from the international community. One thing is certain: African countries are individually and collectively pulling their full weight in the activity necessary at the national  subregional and global levels to provide concrete solutions to the challenge of climate change.   Such participation is significant. In Cameroon  it has taken the form of numerous actions  including the establishment of a national environmental management plan and the adoption at the subregional level of a convergence plan for the sustainable management of the Congo basin forest which  we are all aware  is the world’s second largest.  The implementation of all these measures is very costly  especially in terms of acquiring adapted technologies  and requires our people to accept huge sacrifices. Furthermore  without denying the fact that the fate and future of the planet are everyone’s business  it seems legitimate  in my opinion  to ask that the peoples of Africa be duly compensated by the international community for their efforts and sacrifices. In this regard  we hope that the Copenhagen climate conference scheduled for December will provide satisfactory answers to the particular case of Africa.  Regarding world peace and security  we continue to deplore the persistence of numerous conflicts or hotbeds of tension  despite significant progress towards a return to calm. I refer to the situations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  Darfur and Somalia  among others. Cameroon is playing an active role  including by dispatching Cameroonian contingents  in    09-52470 16  the efforts to find lasting solutions to these conflicts  which have lasted too long.  In this respect  I wish to hail the role of the United Nations  which is making tireless efforts to stabilize all these situations. However  if it is to be more effective  the United Nations requires commensurate human  financial and material resources. Furthermore  the United Nations should be able to reflect the common will of all its Members  large and small  in order to ensure its effectiveness and credibility. It must more clearly assert and further strengthen its role as the crucible par excellence of multilateralism  that is  a forum for the exchange of ideas  solidarity  equity and equality where all the voices and opinions of developed and developing countries alike are expressed and taken into account.  These values go hand in hand with the dialogue of civilizations proposed for our consideration at this session. Such a dialogue should not ignore differences  but rather promote diversity so as to foster knowledge and mutual understanding among peoples. From this perspective  the dialogue of civilizations or cultures advocates tolerance and mutual respect and rejects all forms of fanaticism that threaten international peace and security.  That is the dual role that the United Nations  a proving ground for multilateralism and crucible of the dialogue of civilizations  must assume if it seeks to embody the noblest and deepest aspirations of humankind and satisfy our peoples’ expectations with comprehensive and relevant solutions.  But the question is  how can the United Nations fulfil this role if it does not adapt to the current trends and changes in international relations? That is the purpose of the recommendations we have been making for the reform of the Security Council  the revitalization of the General Assembly and the strengthening of the means of action of the Secretary-General. We therefore need to fast-track the overhaul of an Organization that  through its universal nature  symbolizes our common destiny and seeks to be our common abode. For only a renewed United Nations that is more democratic  more credible and more efficient will be able to inspire peoples’ hopes and trust."
"36",1450,"COD",64,2009,"Mr. President  His Excellency Mr. Joseph Kabila Kabange  President of the Republic  is unable to attend but has instructed me to convey to you his most heartfelt congratulations on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. The head of State has no doubt that your vast experience in the Organization  broadened by your talents and your knowledge  will help you to overcome the myriad of challenges that come with your new office. He expresses his wish also for every success in your work at this regular session.  Let me  as I begin my statement  commend your predecessor  Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann  and express to him our gratitude for his excellent service as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session  which has just been completed  and this to the satisfaction of all Member States.   Lastly  I pay well-deserved tribute to Secretary-General Mr. Ban Ki-moon for his commitment to the quest for peace and security worldwide  in general  and for his very commendable involvement in restoring   33 09-52598  lasting peace in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  my country  in particular.  At this time when the sixty-fourth regular session of the General Assembly is beginning  it is worth dwelling on the situation currently prevailing in certain regions of the planet. In the Middle East  the situation continues to be tenuous and to be the focus of attention of the global public. The Democratic Republic of the Congo recognizes the right of the people of Israel to live in peace in a State with internationally recognized borders  just as it would like to reiterate that the settlement of this conflict specifically entails recognition of the fact that the Palestinian question is at the heart of the very problem in the Middle East.   The situations in Afghanistan and in Iraq continue to be of concern. The Democratic Republic of the Congo urges the international community to eradicate the scourge of terrorism  so that those two countries can fully return to their place on the international scene.  In Africa  and speaking just about our own geographic area in the central and southern portion of the continent  we would like to refer to the healthy progress made in the implementation of the agreements reached in 2006 between the Government of Burundi and the Forces Nationales de Libération; the smooth evolution of the inclusive political dialogue in the Central African Republic; the needed promotion of good-neighbourly relations between Chad and the Sudan; the admittedly slow but sure and determined promotion of democracy; and the consolidation of peace and stability in Southern Africa.  I would like to take this opportunity to sincerely thank the South African facilitation  the Economic Community of Central African States  the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the international community  as well as other bilateral and multilateral partners  for the efforts that they have continued to make to achieve the considerable progress that we hail today.   With respect to the Republic of Madagascar  I would particularly like to express my full satisfaction with the mediation by the eminent SADC representative with respect to the political dialogue. Here  I would like to reiterate the SADC position  which rejects and condemns any unilateral decision that would violate the spirit of the Maputo agreements.   No social or economic order remains safe  if it fails to bring beneficial effects to the greatest number of people. The crisis of the global financial system continues to undermine global economies worldwide  be they developed or developing. For my country  in particular  this crisis has led to a significant drop in export commodity prices  declining currency reserves  the growing cost of imports  with a depreciation of the national currency  declining growth rates and a decline in budget and tax revenues.  The consequences of this turn of events are considerable. This crisis has led to a shortfall in resources to finance infrastructure. It has led to broad job loss  worsening of social conflict  and  particularly at a time when we are coming out of a complex conflict  a shrinking budget to finance the necessary restoration of State authority throughout the national territory in order to complete the establishment of peace. It is urgently necessary therefore to review the international financial system.  The Democratic Republic of the Congo is aware that we will need colossal resources to ensure sustainable development in a world context that has seen surging food and energy prices and a global financial crisis. These phenomena are compounded by the effects of climate change. That is why I welcome the holding by the Secretary-General on 22 September 2009 of the high-level event on this issue. If we do not make decisions on the fate of present and future generations with respect to global warming and climate change and if we are not able to prevent rising sea levels  desertification or the extinction of species and the loss of biodiversity  inter alia  our world will inevitably move towards the risk of a disaster for which the African continent will be the first to bear the costs.   The issue of adopting a post-Kyoto agreement that would require polluter countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and financially compensate those who have forests needs to be seriously considered.  The Democratic Republic of the Congo accounts for more than half of the forests in the Congo basin  which is the second largest in the world after the Amazon region. This area has an enormous asset that it will defend at the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  scheduled for December 2009 in Copenhagen.     09-52598 34   With respect to reform of the United Nations system  the Democratic Republic of the Congo agrees with the view that the current United Nations system is no longer  in its current design  in keeping with the expectations of those who promote it or even with the letter of Charter  which is its inspiration. That is why we would like to reiterate our plea for the full representation of Africa in the decision-making bodies  and more specifically in the Security Council.   Regardless of the outcome of the current negotiations on this matter  my delegation continues to be of the view that any viable reform of the Security Council must take into account the political and numerical weight of Africa in the General Assembly  especially since two thirds of the situations before the Security Council involve Africa.   With respect to the responsibility to protect  we believe that it is up to each State to protect its people from genocide  war crimes  crimes against humanity or ethnic cleansing. We are also of the view that the principal role of the international community in these areas should be to determine how to build institutional capacities and provide substantial assistance to States  more specifically to the Administrations of countries in post-conflict situations  so that they can acquire the means to ensure that they have the resources to provide this protection.   I have very succinctly addressed the major challenges that today’s world faces and for which we need to build a common response. I have talked about reform of the United Nations and about the responsibility to protect. I have not addressed the Democratic Republic of the Congo or the troubled region of the African Great Lakes. Three years after the success of the electoral operations in 2006  the Democratic Republic of the Congo is now  at long last  facing the trying process of normalizing democratic life. We understand that restoring the rule of law is an urgent priority.  In that context  peace and stability can only persist if the citizens realize that politically sensitive issues can be resolved by legitimate and fair means. The rule of law cannot go hand in hand with corruption. It is no exaggeration to assert that the efforts initiated recently by the President of the Republic and the Government to fight corruption and to put an end to the rule of impunity have begun to bear fruit. However  we accept that much remains to be done in terms of capacity-building to ensure proper administration of justice.  The Congolese experience of the 2006 democratic elections was built on a difficult legacy of the dark years of foreign occupation followed by an internal rift  the consequences of which are still seen today in the ongoing use of rape as a weapon of war. To address that situation  at the request of the Congolese authorities  the first investigation of the International Criminal Court began by considering the serious crimes that had been committed on the territory of the Democratic Republic of the Congo since 1 July 2002. The rest is well known: the first three cases before the International Criminal Court are based on that submission and the national courts have also been called upon to work on those issues.  The Congolese courts currently involved are certainly already playing an important role in restoring the rule of law  but a successful transition from war to peace  from a divided past to a shared future  cannot be envisaged for the people of the Democratic Republic of the Congo without a mechanism that can bring a sense of justice to all citizens  establish or renew civic trust  restore the duty of memory and reconcile the people and the communities.  The sexual violence perpetrated against women and girls in the eastern part of Democratic Republic of the Congo is  in our view  the most shameful and gravest crime witnessed by humankind in the twenty-first century. Statistically  80 per cent of the crimes committed in the entire country took place mainly in the two provinces in the East of the country most affected by the effects of war  namely South and North Kivu. In fact  60 per cent of the rapes were committed in North Kivu and 20 per cent in South Kivu. Justice must be done to the women and girls who have been raped.  I can already attest to the strong resolve of His Excellency President Joseph Kabila Kabange to put an end to impunity for the perpetrators of those heinous crimes  whether civilian or military. Despite the apocalyptic picture  the situation that persists in the East of my country continues to improve.  In conformity with the relevant provisions of the Pact on Security  Stability and Development in the Great Lakes Region  the Democratic Republic of the Congo  working with Rwanda and Uganda respectively  launched joint military operations last year and early   35 09-52598  this year with a view to disarming and  where necessary  forcing the rebels of the Lord’s Resistance Army  on the one hand  and those of the Forces démocratiques de libération du Rwanda (FDLR)  on the other  to return to their respective countries. As part of the same military operations  called Kimia II  the Forces armées de la République démocratique du Congo (FARDC) are carrying out an offensive against the elements of the FDLR that have remained in the mountains of South Kivu  in order to bring peace to that region.   The results  I repeat  are positive. By way of illustration  the authority of the State has been restored; the FDLR command posts in North and South Kivu have been destroyed; more and more FDLR troops are surrendering to the FARDC and to the United Nations Observer Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC); several FDLR elements have returned to their country of origin; all the communication and supply lines in North and South Kivu are now open; the fight against the illegal exploitation of natural resources and the protection of Virunga National Park have been strengthened; and the incidents of rape and all other forms of sexual violence against women have seen an appreciable decline.   Peace is gradually being established to the great benefit of the Congolese people. Moreover  fruitful talks aimed at benefiting our bilateral and multilateral relations with Burundi  Uganda and Rwanda are under way  and the future looks better.  The return to normalcy in our subregion is enabling us to make efforts towards the urgent peacebuilding and economic recovery of the country. As the President of the Republic continues to underscore  the Democratic Republic of the Congo has resolutely undertaken to strengthen and promote the ideals of national reconciliation  peace  democracy and good governance within its borders  and is unquestionably committed to a policy of openness without exclusion based on dialogue and cooperation of all kinds with all countries that favour peace and dialogue. Our wish today is to see the international community step up its efforts and continue to support the process of bringing about peace and unity.  On the elections  my country is preparing to hold city  municipal and local elections  which represents a great meeting of the people with its history. The steps to update the national register of the Independent Electoral Commission started in the first half of 2009.   The Democratic Republic of the Congo is already involved in the reform of its institutions. It is important to conclude those various reforms  in particular in the area of the administration of justice. The Congolese justice system will be more effective and efficient if it has the international community’s support  especially in terms of capacity-building.  Reform of the security system is also under way. The reform of the army and police services has had the consistent support of bilateral partners and of the United Nations through MONUC  its Mission in the Congo. My country is firmly committed to working to successfully conclude that reform aimed at ensuring not only its peace  unity  territorial integrity  national sovereignty and stability but also those of the entire subregion by preventing the reoccurrence of the security problems and tensions seen there.  In addition  the Government is doing its utmost  through duly identified ways to increase prosperity  to implement programmes in order to meet the basic needs of the people  in particular on health  education  food self-sufficiency  basic infrastructure  electricity and drinking water for all  not to mention  of course  the fight against malaria and HIV/AIDS as well as poverty alleviation.   Like other post-conflict countries  the Democratic Republic of the Congo underscores the urgent need to organize and hold an international conference on the financing of its reconstruction as soon as possible. For us  it is a question of building a new Congo  a nation opening up to the world at the centre of a continent full of change  a country where every foreigner  indiscriminately  can be free  assured of the protection of his investments  to work for his better future. All that foreigners do to contribute to our development will be duly acknowledged and appreciated.  Emerging from a long war with many outside implications  the Democratic Republic of the Congo  my country  is fully aware of the importance of regional cooperation. The most fervent wish of the Congolese people is to restore relations of trust and cooperation with all its neighbours  without exception. The Government intends to pursue a policy of dialogue  openness  friendship  cooperation and good-neighbourliness  because the country has always strived to work to bring about a more united Africa that    09-52598 36  stands together  distinct in its greater understanding  tolerance  peace and solidarity.   By way of conclusion  allow me to reiterate that so much war and fratricidal violence has taught us that the most expensive peace is still less onerous than the cheapest war. In this regard  I appeal for international solidarity during this stage of building our hard-won peace  for a peaceful and stable Democratic Republic of the Congo is an asset to our planet’s common destiny.  I would be remiss if I did not conclude my statement without thanking once again all those whose commitment  courage and determination have helped and continue to help my country embrace the concepts of negotiation and peaceful settlement of crisis by casting aside war and the use of force."
"37",1497,"COG",64,2009,"I would like at the outset to welcome the election of Mr. Ali Treki to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session  which is taking place at a time when major challenges continue to test the effectiveness of our Organization. From this rostrum  I would also like to pay tribute to his predecessor  Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann  and to his courageous and energetic actions throughout his term. I also thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his exceptional work at the head of our Organization at a time in history when important reforms are being undertaken.  I wish to emphasize the extent to which  now more than ever  the United Nations symbolizes hope in the face of the major challenges threatening our planet  which no nation can meet alone. People have never had such need of that hope.   The Summit on Climate Change  held recently at the initiative of the Secretary-General  called once again upon the collective conscience of all nations large and small  united and stirred by a common resolve to work to build the better world of which the founding fathers of our Organization dreamed. In this village that our world has become  we Members of the United Nations are the guarantors of people’s liberties and rights  their security and their future  their dignity and the promise of world peace.  Mr. Hackett (Barbados)  Vice-President  took the chair.  I know what solidarity owes to the dedication of the United Nations  and what peace owes to its actions  commitment and determination. And I foresee what the future will owe it. It is here that are forged freedom and human rights  solidarity and universal justice — in a word  the destiny of humankind. The men and women here know that more than a billion people still live on less than a dollar a day and that children die unnecessarily of hunger and disease. All of us here know how climate change is abetting these scourges and how the countries least responsible for it suffer the most from its effects. Producing only 3.8 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions  our continent is the most affected by global warming. Poor populations are its main victims. The agriculture  fauna and infrastructure of coastal regions are on the front line.  The Brundtland report of the World Commission on Environment and Development (A/42/427  annex)  submitted to the General Assembly in 1987  gave us  more than 20 years ago  the following definition of sustainable development: “development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs” (Ibid.  p. 54).   Sustainable development is not a concept  as we have all learned at our own expense; it is an issue fraught with genuine responsibilities. The balance of ecosystems has never been so threatened. Urgent measures are required in Africa and in all nations to guarantee food security  combat drought and desertification  and restore natural ecosystems. Such measures require the mobilization of significant resources.      09-52470 8  When one’s main resource is the forest  one bears an immense responsibility. We represent the Earth’s second most important environmental lung  after the Amazon. Together with our Latin American brothers  we are aware of our responsibility as guardians of forests that represent an essential treasure for all humankind.  Since the 1990s  the Congo has worked continuously with the international community to combat global warming and to implement a policy of forest protection. Today  our action is more essential than ever. Our forests represent vast carbon sinks of global importance for regulating the greenhouse-gas effect. They are our common salvation and home to 400 species of mammals  more than 1 000 species of birds and more than 10 000 species of plants  3 000 of which are endemic. Gorillas  forest buffaloes  chimpanzees  bonobos and forest elephants — these are what must inspire our action  as they help to maintain the ecological functions of natural systems.  In 1999  the countries of the Congo basin launched a unique forestry experiment by proclaiming their common resolve to preserve their biodiversity and promote the sustainable and joint management of their forest ecosystems  as well as by ensuring the use of resources for Central Africa’s economic and social development. The resulting plan is one of the strategic components of the New Partnership for Africa’s Development. It represents a significant contribution by Central Africa to the effort to address the problems related to global warming. Unfortunately  the funds necessary for the programme’s implementation are still lacking.   The countries of the region have nonetheless made great progress in forest preservation. Today  Africa requests that the forthcoming Copenhagen Conference consider mechanisms for adaptation  mitigation  capacity-building  technology transfer and financing based on the principle of equity. In Copenhagen  we must take earnest account of the forests  which represent carbon sinks of global importance for regulating and stabilizing our planet’s climate.   The economic and financial crisis  whose effects we continue to feel  is the most serious economic recession that the world has experienced since the Great Depression of the 1930s. This crisis should help to raise our awareness. It justifies an overhaul of the international financial architecture and can enable us  through new commitments  to realize the vision of a more unified and equitable world. But time is running out  in Africa more than elsewhere  and the adoption of decisive measures can wait no longer.  Halfway towards the deadline for achieving the Millennium Development Goals  our success will depend on the international community’s new choices and on the effective implementation of announced measures. The commitments undertaken at the April 2009 London summit of the Group of 20 must be honoured  and we hope that the meeting to be held in Pittsburgh will fulfil all our expectations.   In its capacity as African Union co-mediator  together with Libya  of the crisis between Chad and the Sudan  the Republic of the Congo welcomes the willingness  expressed by both parties at the African Union summit  to relaunch negotiations based on the Doha Agreement of 3 May 2009. We also note with satisfaction that the tripartite initiative aimed at a joint settlement in the subregion  with the assistance of the United Nations Peacebuilding Support Office in the Central African Republic  the General Secretariat of the Economic Community of Central African States  the Commission of the Central African Economic and Monetary Community and the General Secretariat of the Community of Sahelo-Saharan States  should enable us to curb the insecurity on the borders of Cameroon  the Central African Republic and Chad for the long term.   We welcome the significant progress seen recently in relations among the countries of the Great Lakes region on our continent. The warming of relations between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda  the revitalization of the Economic Community of the Great Lakes Countries  and the normalization of relations between Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo reflect the common will of the Great Lakes countries to work to consolidate peace.   With respect to the Israeli-Palestinian crisis  we encourage any initiative to promote sustained dialogue between the parties in the quest for a definitive and equitable solution to the crisis.  We welcome the unanimous adoption  on 24 September 2009 at the historic Security Council   9 09-52470  summit (see S/PV.6191)  of resolution 1887 (2009)  which reflects the determination of the international community to work towards disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation for a safer world.  In the light of these many challenges  we call for strict compliance with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in all its aspects  including the right of all countries to develop nuclear technologies for civilian purposes.  The Congolese people renewed their confidence in me last July. That confidence is based on the concept that we call the “path of the future”. That path proposes opening the Congo to modernization and industrialization  to the pursuit of peacebuilding  the strengthening of democracy and the rule of law  to the promotion of good governance and to the protection of human rights. We have pledged to open a new path to the future and to mark it with proper behaviour and clean technologies. We have pledged in my country to never sit on our hands and watch the Earth suffer. That is a promise which I repeat here.  Our African storytellers have often said that men were the dream of the Earth. I solemnly promise that not only will Africans do everything in their power to never become its nightmare; they will  on the contrary  open up a gateway to the future for all of us."
"38",1544,"COL",64,2009,"I would like to congratulate the President of the General Assembly and reiterate to the United Nations our gratitude for its positive presence and cooperation with the Colombian people.  The Government over which I preside aims to enhance the confidence of the national and international community in Colombia. This quest for confidence is based on three pillars: security with democratic values  the promotion of investment and entrepreneurship with social responsibility  and social cohesion with freedoms.  We continue with our security advances  but also there are some outstanding challenges. I would like to highlight some intangible achievements that attest to the democratic credentials of our security project.   We have recovered two monopolies that we should never have lost: the monopoly of institutional forces to fight criminals and the monopoly of justice that the terrorists tried to dislodge. We have dismantled paramilitarism  a term that emerged to describe private criminal gangs whose objective was to fight drug-trafficking guerrillas. Today  the State is the only entity that fights all those criminals. Those criminals in all their forms — narco-guerrillas  criminal gangs — are part of a mafia-type relationship that unites them or pits them against each other to distribute or fight over the gains of the criminal drug business.   Justice  with the Supreme Court that was attacked in 1985 by drug traffickers and guerrillas; justice  which was tormented by the threats to and assassination of judges and was dislodged in many regions by the terrorists leaders of guerrillas and paramilitary groups that attempted to replace it; justice has  throughout the entire country  regained its full effectiveness.  Victims did not complain out of fear of retaliation or because they thought it was pointless. Now  thanks to the recovery of our security  we have registered 239 758 victims  whose situations we are determined to remedy  a remedy that is never complete but which will lead little by little to reconciliation by overcoming of the spirit of vengeance and hatred.  We have regained the independence of decentralization and of political exercise. Terrorism had displaced 30 per cent of our mayors  stolen and corrupted municipal and departmental budgets and exercised coercion within the public sector. Mayors have regained their security so that they may freely carry out their duties and transparently manage their resources. Politics is now expressed freely in all spectrums of thought. This terrorist threat has been tackled without martial law  with full civil and political guarantees and absolute respect for the freedom that we promote with security.   We are working to improve the effectiveness of our public forces as well as respect for human rights. We do not hesitate to punish those who violate them  but neither do we refrain from defending our soldiers and policemen who sometimes have been victims of a dirty legal war. Colombia has voluntarily presented itself to a United Nations human rights review.   Furthermore  despite the suffering caused by landmines that had been planted by terrorist groups  the State destroyed those that were used by its public forces for training purposes. Our country is one of the leaders of the Ottawa Convention to destroy these landmines and will host the next meeting of States parties in Cartagena.    09-52228 14   We tackle terrorism with the utmost determination  and we practise democracy fervently. That is why the doors of Colombia have been open without restriction to international vigilance. We deliberate and disagree  but both impartial observers and biased critics have had complete freedom to express themselves in Colombia.  Our interest does not lie in the fanatical confrontation between left and right  which is as dangerous as it is obsolete. Rather  we are betting on a modern democracy  a democracy that is safe and free  that builds social cohesion  a democracy with independent institutions and with confidence that stems from the transparency that is based on a high level of civic participation.  We have not been able to completely overcome the problem of displacement  but we have increased our budget twelvefold to help displaced persons. We promote trust between public forces and communities so that those who fight drug trafficking are not thwarted by the displacement that is caused by drug traffickers.  We have demobilized 51 783 members of terrorist groups  whose numbers have dropped from around 60 000 to fewer than 8 000. We have been extremely generous with those who have been demobilized and extremely severe with the 7 per cent who have returned to crime. The Justice and Peace Law  which covers them  made it possible to report 29 555 criminal acts  12 104 confessions  the discovery of 2 043 graves with 2 492 corpses  the identification of 708 bodies and the return of 581 to their families. The participation of victims and new procedures for restitution and restoration of their rights are a decisive component of this demobilization process.  Terrorism cannot be ignored in the name of good international relations. To the contrary  multilateralism and diplomacy must lead to collaborative action among States to overcome this tragedy and its corollaries  including arms trafficking  illicit drugs  money and asset laundering and terrorist havens.  We reaffirm our commitment to multilateralism in all its legitimate expressions  from organizations of neighbouring countries to the most global Organization  but we believe that multilateralism must demonstrate that it is effective in defeating international crime.  Colombia has acknowledged its internal problem of narco-terrorism. We have carried out a heroic struggle that will ultimately prevail. We cooperate with the international community and we ask for more effective cooperation. We are cooperating with Mexico  Guatemala  Panama  Costa Rica  Haiti  the Dominican Republic  Peru  Afghanistan and other countries. We acknowledge the efforts of the United States to work together with us to make progress in dismantling narco-terrorism. We request greater cooperation from more countries and from the international community. Our objective is to restore domestic security and never to participate in the arms race for the bloody game of international warfare. Our tradition is one of respect for the global community.  We are concerned that  instead of progress towards greater cooperation to ensure the security  peace and tranquillity of the citizens of all countries  there is an acceleration of the arms race. Some justify it by citing the need to modernize their military equipment  while others admit their desire for war.  Multilateral agencies  led by the United Nations  must strengthen their action so that Governments will fulfil their duty to protect their citizens and their obligation not to attack the international community.  In Colombia  the only reason for terrorism is the drug trade. Its violent criminals used to deny being involved in narco-terrorism and to try to appear ideological; today  having lost all sense of decency  they cannot hide their criminal enterprise or feign ideological postures  which are negated by their cruelty towards their victims and those whom they have kidnapped. The democratic transparency of our country  which they tried to destroy  ensures that they will never be acceptable.  We have a different view of co-responsibility and of the proposal that drugs be legalized. The former division between producer and consumer countries has disappeared. Colombia began as a trafficking territory  burst into production and now suffers as a consumer. Those who began as consumers increase production. All peoples are exposed to the risks of drug production  trafficking and consumption. Co-responsibility must thus be exercised in accordance with its real meaning: a task that belongs to all of us  without any reservations.  We believe that  instead of advocating the legalization of drugs  we should consider the need to   15 09-52228  criminalize consumption. There is no consistency between toughness when it comes to production and trafficking and permissiveness when it comes to consumption. That has led to deadly micro-trafficking in cities  the promotion of consumption by adolescents and young people and the involvement of children in the criminal trade. We are making progress in the constitutional process of criminalizing consumption  taking care not to confuse the sick addict with the criminal distributor.   Our Government is promoting investment and entrepreneurship as ways to overcome poverty and build equity. Colombia is moving forward in terms of competitiveness and confidence. Investment must perform a function of social responsibility to acquire popular legitimacy in democratic societies. Social responsibility — not speculation — is inseparable from capital as a significant factor in social-wealth creation. The economic crisis is a crisis of speculation  rather than of creative free enterprise. We are confident that the necessary conventions will be adopted to avoid the risks created by speculative money transfers and financial market speculation. We fear a new era of protectionism and the selective closure of developed economies  which would impede sustainable economic recovery.  Social responsibility is inseparable from the fight against climate change. Colombia is a net producer of oxygen and emits insignificant amounts of carbon dioxide. However  we are highly vulnerable  as shown by the winter tragedies in recent years  which have caused losses in terms of human life  production and high service costs. We support tougher international conventions to protect the environment. We hope that the Copenhagen conference will produce effective binding instruments so that it will not be another dead letter.  Our main contribution to the fight against climate change is the preservation of our 578 000-square-kilometre rainforest  which constitutes more than 51 per cent of our national territory and the majority of which lies along the Amazon. We have as a concrete policy the forest ranger family programme  which has involved more than 90 000 rural families in the collective effort to protect the rainforest  keep it free from the shadow of illicit drugs and ensure its recovery where it has been destroyed. The State pays a bonus to those families. The programme  supervised by the United Nations  has received the highest rating from the Organization.  In Colombia  forest ranger families protect the Amazon rainforest from predatory drugs; elsewhere in the world  a similar model could preserve trees in order to mitigate climate change.  Clean energy  mass transportation systems and the protection of water sources are essential actions in our contribution to the fight against global warming. Colombia  at more than 1 million litres per day  is the second-largest Latin American producer of ethanol from sugar cane and  at 1.8 million litres per day  the largest producer of biodiesel from African palm. The conditions in our country make it possible to increase those outputs without destroying the rainforest or limiting food security.  We have introduced incentives for other clean energies such as solar and wind energy  the development of which remains small despite their great potential.  We are working on building nine mass transportation systems in major cities and are now in the process of incorporating another 10 that are proportionally sized  with a view to replacing individual transportation with collective transportation.  Eleven per cent of our national territory has been designated a protected area. In natural sanctuaries such as the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta  which is the highest coastal sanctuary in the world  agreements with indigenous communities are being implemented. In exchange for security  the recovery of lands and the building of seven out of nine promised villages  they have once again taken over the noble task of preserving forests and water sources.  We gain nothing from security  investment  health  education or any other social cohesion policy if we do not attach equal importance to the environment. We understand this in a “mega-diverse” nation that contains 14 per cent of the planet’s diversity and ranks second — behind Brazil — in terms of plant and animal species and first in terms of amphibians and birds.  Our fervent desire is to increase the Human Opportunity Index in order to eliminate poverty  build equity and guarantee every possible alternative for new generations. We propose to include in the measuring of the Index progress and setbacks in environmental    09-52228 16  policies. Opportunities are pointless without environmental protection. Let us be effective in our fight against climate change so that we do not condemn the future inhabitants of the Earth to a planetary holocaust."
"39",1584,"COM",64,2009,"I wish to pay tribute to the President of the General Assembly and the Secretary-General for their dedication to their noble missions.   For once  I do not wish to conclude my statement with the issue of the Comorian island of Mayotte  as I usually do. I should like to address that sensitive issue first. It affects not only the unity and integrity of the Comoros and its history and international law  but also peace in the region of the Indian Ocean.   The General Assembly has condemned the French presence on the Comorian island of Mayotte several times  because the Comoros was admitted to the international community with its colonial borders  which include the islands of Mayotte  Anjouan  Moheli and Grand Comore. Despite many relevant and final United Nations resolutions and several consultations held on the island  France continues to hold referendums on Mayotte to definitively anchor that Comorian island to the French Republic. Those consultations have made it possible to change the status of the Comorian island of Mayotte several times — only within the framework of internal French law — until  through the most recent consultation  the island became the 101st French department.   Moreover  it should be noted that the relations between France and the Comoros are unique. Indeed  despite the dispute arising from the separation of one island from its three sisters — thus handicapping the Comoros Archipelago by changing it into a three-legged cow  as President Ahmed Abdallah Abderemane said — the Comoros  contrary to what one might think  enjoys a special partnership with France.   France is present on the Comoros in the sense that  in the international community  it is always associated with major decisions that affect my country’s future. France remains the primary economic partner of the Comoros. It is one of the largest contributors of development assistance to my country. More than 200 000 Comorian citizens live on French soil. Those are just a few examples to demonstrate that no hostility exists between our two peoples or our two countries. And we are firmly resolved not only to   09-52320 2  continue that special partnership  but also to reaffirm it even more.   However  this desire for harmony in no way constitutes a renunciation of our firm attachment to the territorial integrity of our country. That is why I have taken the initiative to come here to solemnly present to France  before the entire international community  a proposal to resolve this dispute.   In fact  I propose to France that it recognize that the four islands of the Comoros Archipelago remain an indivisible nation based on the principle of one country  two administrations. By that principle  I mean that France recognizes the full sovereignty of the Union of the Comoros throughout its territory while continuing to administer the Comorian island of Mayotte.   Obviously  both parties must reach agreement on the duration of the French presence on the Comorian island of Mayotte. On the other hand  we request that France actively assist in the economic development of the three other islands to achieve a certain balance throughout the Archipelago — a balance that will necessarily encourage a harmonious rapprochement among them and will enable the Comorian island of Mayotte to finally return to its natural home. This process will enable our brothers and sisters of Mayotte to maintain their social advantages and their standard of living and the other three islands to rise to the many development challenges they face.  I am convinced that with the active participation of the whole of the international community these new proposals  which should become part of the negotiations between France and the Comoros  would lead to a happy outcome. France and the Comoros have nearly two centuries of life together  two centuries of shared history  culture and language. We do not have the right to spoil that patrimony by allowing misunderstandings to persist  by continuing to let play out the tragedies that make of the sea lane between Anjouan and Mayotte one of the greatest maritime cemeteries in the world. For all of these reasons we come here  in the full view of the world  to demonstrate our good will  which we dare to hope will never be obliterated by an attitude of inflexibility or intransigence.  We meet every year in these prestigious surroundings to debate questions of peace  security and development. Unfortunately  we have to acknowledge that our joint efforts do not always lead to conclusive results  since as of today numerous challenges remain  and their consequences for our countries and our peoples are becoming ever more dire.   Certainly  some progress can be seen here and there  yet our people continue to suffer hunger  malnutrition and sickness. Our children do not have the benefit of an education of the quality necessary to assure them a better future. Health care remains a luxury for most of our citizens. Some of our villages and even cities suffer a cruel lack of basic social services  indeed even of potable water and electricity.   Finally  many of our countries  particularly small island States like my own  are threatened by multiple natural catastrophes whose consequences only aggravate an already fragile socio-economic situation. Certain of our nations are even at risk of no longer appearing on the map of the world in a few years. That catastrophic situation  which prevails in an era when  paradoxically  every day sees enormous technical and technological advances  must challenge and incite us to redouble our efforts to find appropriate responses.  Thus a genuine international mobilization — especially on the part of those countries most equipped to face the challenges confronting us all — is required. We must take concrete  urgent and concerted action and make a determined stand against the consequences of the economic  financial and food crises that lash all our countries without distinction.  I believe now is the time to demonstrate active solidarity and pragmatism if we want our words to translate into concrete actions and if we want to rekindle hope in our peoples  who have suffered more than enough. Obviously our developing nations are not asking for the moon — at least not for now. We merely ask that we join our efforts to satisfy the legitimate demands of our peoples  who only aspire to live better and with dignity  peace and peace of mind.  Our Organization has a great role to play in the realization of that goal  and for its voice to reach as far as necessary we must all agree on the need to bring to its various branches the necessary reforms. Indeed  only an organization that is more representative  more democratic and more equitable in its various institutions will be in a position to better address the problems all countries face  to understand them and conceive the solutions most likely to produce more peace  stability and development.   3 09-52320   Furthermore  in the framework of respect for human rights and good international governance  the abusive use of universal jurisdiction should be fought by working for a better structure for such jurisdiction  but also to put in place an organ to regulate the principle of jurisdiction itself. A better definition of the concept of the responsibility to protect should also be sought  with sufficient time allocated to seriously consider its implementation.  Peace and security remain essential conditions for the promotion of socio-economic development. Thus the conflict conditions that prevail in numerous regions of the world call out a challenge to us. We must show greater solidarity in regard to the populations of regions that for years on end have known only desolation  despair and humiliation.  We should also celebrate the initiative undertaken by President Barack Obama in the Middle East  which offers the hope of seeing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict resolved through a solution that is just  equitable and acceptable to the parties involved — notably the solidification of the two-State principle  as stipulated by the various United Nations resolutions on the matter.  Moreover  I take this opportunity to applaud the presence among us of His Excellency President Barack Obama  whose charisma  dynamism and sense of justice renew our hope to see the United States of America act with more engagement and pragmatism in the service of peace  justice and development in the world.   I will not neglect to mention Iraq  Afghanistan  Somalia  the Democratic Republic of Congo  the Great Lakes region and Darfur  where fratricidal conflicts only further exacerbate poverty and underdevelopment. We therefore urge the international community to offer its assistance to those brother countries so as to put an end to that unfortunate situation.  I cannot close this chapter on crises and conflicts without wishing my Malagasy brothers and sisters complete success in the ongoing negotiations for a peaceful transition that quickly leads to peace and stability being restored in this sister island and to renewed efforts for its economic prosperity.  Here  I would also like to reiterate the unwavering support of the Union of the Comoros to the People’s Republic of China and to the Kingdom of Morocco in their legitimate efforts to recover their territorial integrity.  To conclude  I am greatly honoured to express the warm thanks and deep appreciation of the Comorian delegation to all the American authorities  in particular those of the State of New York  for the good arrangements to ensure us a pleasant stay in this great and beautiful country.  (spoke in Arabic)  I beseech God that we have a session that serves humanity."
"40",1623,"CPV",64,2009,"Before beginning my statement  I would like to mention something that happened on our continent  in West Africa  yesterday. Indeed  tragic events occurred yesterday in a country in West Africa  of which Cape Verde is a part: soldiers once again fired on a crowd. As a neighbouring  friendly and long-standing partner country of Guinea  I wish  on behalf of my country  to express my deep sympathy and the unequivocal condemnation of an act that disgraces the entire continent. I am referring to a challenge to the brave people of Guinea and to the international community. I pay tribute to the numerous victims of this odious act  which threatens stability and peace in the entire subregion. I am pleased to congratulate Ambassador Ali Abdussalam Treki on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. I also congratulate his predecessor  Father Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann  for his involvement  dedication and courage  which left an important imprint on the work of the sixty-third session. To Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon  Cape Verde expresses its confidence that he will continue to further our aspirations and consolidate the foundations of this Organization he leads that is dedicated to the common good. We thank him for his detailed report on the work of the Organization (A/64/1).   Peace  security and development are public assets that are essential to the progress of humanity. However  they have never before been as threatened as they are today. Therefore  I would like to share with the Assembly some of my country’s concerns in that context.   During the Assembly’s sixty-second session  the Prime Minister of Cape Verde  Mr. José Maria Neves  said:   “We are living at a time when problems and threats are of concern to all. They are not confined to a single State or region. Nor can there be local solutions to the global threats of our era.” (A/62/PV.11  p. 2) He was referring to terrorism  organized crime and human trafficking and to weapons and drugs that in certain instances threaten the foundations of the democratic rule of law. He said that these phenomena “corrupt values  compromise development and thwart the most legitimate expectations of peoples” who are exposed to them and that “Responses to these issues will be ineffective unless they are undertaken within a robust  balanced and fair multilateral perspective” (ibid.).  I quote these remarks by the head of Government of Cape Verde because they are quite current and because the themes they address have been the object of increasing attention by the international community.  Cape Verde and other West African States are facing organized crime  which has found fertile ground for its activities in our region because of our fragile economies  the vulnerability of our emerging democracies and  in general  our States’ weak capacities to respond to this major threat. With the support of the United Nations  in particular the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and the logistics capabilities of our partners  we  the States members of the Economic Community of West African States are pooling our capabilities to confront this tremendous challenge that has engulfed our subregion.   In Cape Verde we believe that a small country cannot allow itself to be poor  vulnerable and unstable all at once. We therefore seek to reinforce our advantages  reduce our weaknesses and diversify our partnerships  in addition to strengthening our relations   09-53165 18  of solidarity for the benefit of peace  stability and progress in our subregion.  Therefore  at the October 2008 conference on drug trafficking in our region and at the April 2009 round table on Guinea-Bissau security sector reform  both held in Praia  the capital of Cape Verde  we sought to define together the parameters of our actions in these areas. We will continue to pay special attention to this threat  as we are convinced that the zone of peace we are building in the South Atlantic must become a tangible reality if we wish to achieve the Millennium Development Goals and  in general  the life of peace and progress that we wish for all.  In this context in which States and democratic processes are threatened by exogenous elements  multilateralism appears as an indispensable shield and an essential resource. There is no doubt that this confluence of wills and means among the most diverse countries and the most widespread regions at the heart of the international community constitutes the path to follow  not only for strengthening cooperation among the entities of international life and for the timely resolution of differences in the framework of the principles and values of the United Nations  but also for the strengthening of international law  which is indispensable for strengthening peace and security in the world.   The United Nations  in this context  remains the central element of the collective conscience of the community of nations. Thus the revitalization of the United Nations system emerges as a necessity of our time  giving priority to the participation of all  to the detriment of unilateralism  strengthening efficiency for the benefit of common interests and seeking solutions that meet the aspirations of the most vulnerable and of present and future generations.  Cape Verde is contributing to that framework as one of the eight pilot countries testing the Delivering as One process on the ground  which is successfully under way as a unique programme with a unique budgeting plan  a single purpose and single leader. This process has had positive repercussions on cooperation between the Government and the agencies  funds and programmes of the United Nations working in Cape Verde  thus enhancing the coherence of this programme  reducing transaction and administrative costs and benefiting all.  According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  it is expected that the global gross domestic product will shrink by more than 2.5 per cent in 2009. The growth of developing countries will decrease from 5.4 per cent in 2008 to 1.3 per cent in 2009  which means a reduction in the average per capita income. In light of the stagnation and reduction of economic growth  the developing countries have seen an increase in poverty  unemployment  the cost of essential goods and malnutrition. With the drastic reduction in investment  there is a strong likelihood that the Millennium Development Goals will not be achieved.  It is expected that in 2009 world trade will be reduced by at least 11 per cent in real terms and by 20 per cent in dollar terms. For the African continent  the prognosis points to a significant deceleration of the growth of production in 2009. However  it will remain positive and drop to 3 per cent in North Africa and 1 per cent in sub-Saharan Africa. The medium- and low-income countries in this context will certainly require more support in the form of a coordinated effort at the international level to increase official development assistance.   The perspective of a solution to the crisis is significant. It requires  among other things  a new political strategy that includes regulation of the financial market. The recent meeting of the Group of 20 in Pittsburgh offers some elements of response. Indeed  management of the crisis in the context of globalization and interdependence requires an integrated response of the parties as well as a change in the global financial system  more efficient institutions  countercyclical policies  better monitoring of risk and institutional regulation. The outcome document adopted by consensus at the United Nations Conference on the World Financial and Economic Crisis of 24 to 26 June 2009 (resolution 63/303  annex) contains recommendations to fight economic recession and establishes viable and safe financial practices  in addition to indicating important areas of intervention.   Cape Verde  despite the difficult situation created by the economic and financial crisis  seeks to preserve the gains already made in the various areas of the Millennium Development Goals  thanks to a prudent and pragmatic policy and taking its partners into account to help diminish the impact of the crisis on the archipelago.   19 09-53165   We think all international partners must implement joint efforts to minimize the impact of the economic deceleration  especially for developing countries  and enable all to achieve more inclusive  equitable and balanced development  oriented towards economic sustainability  to help overcome poverty and inequity in order to avoid an unprecedented human crisis.  The Summit on Climate Change organized by the Secretary-General last week was an undeniable success. The Member States wished to participate in large numbers to reaffirm their determination to see this vital problem treated in a convincing  urgent and genuine manner. The head of State of one of the heavy-emitting countries declared that if we do not act now  no one will ever be able to do so  reinforcing what scientists have been demonstrating for some time: that our planet is at serious risk of not being able to assure life in all its fullness because of the consequences of climate change. And the time to act is now.  The participants departed the Summit convinced that there is no more time for evasion. The moment has come for concerted  coherent and systematic action to achieve a convincing and meaningful reduction of greenhouse gases  to slow global warming and avoid raised sea levels likely to endanger vast coastal regions throughout the world  particularly the small developing island States. Such States are increasingly vulnerable and suffer the most from the consequences of a situation created to a large extent by emitter States. At its summit here in New York on 21 September  the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS)  of which Cape Verde is a member  adopted a declaration clarifying its position on various points being negotiated within the framework of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.  Cape Verde is a small archipelago with a small population  in a geographic location that leaves it simultaneously isolated in the ocean and dangerously exposed to the effects of climate change and global warming. As a Sahelian State  it has long faced drought  desertification and a serious lack of water. Those phenomena aggravate the population’s poverty  hinder Government efforts and strongly affect actions in the areas of environmental preservation and human development.  In Cape Verde we are making efforts to make the best possible use of our river basins  saving water wherever possible and adopting modern irrigation methods with the help of new technologies. We are implementing an active policy in that area. A dam on one of our islands is energizing the local agricultural sector and allowing us to promote better subsistence methods among farmers  while helping us develop renewable power sources throughout the country with the goal of providing electricity to 95 per cent of the country by 2011. A research and development centre for renewable energies aimed at serving the entire West African region is under construction in Cape Verde.  The international community  and the developed countries in particular  must strive to support the specific dynamics of those States in the areas of adaptation to and mitigation of the effects of climate change and to enable them to minimize the risks that burden them today  given that some of those States are already facing issues of mass dislocation and forced migrations.  For the people of Cape Verde  the ocean is more than a nurturing mother or a demanding lover — it is our vital source of civilization and inspiration. We want to protect it; we want to preserve it. But equally  along with the coastal nations of the Atlantic Ocean  particularly in its southern half  we want to see it be an area of exchange  not speculation  a realm of active solidarity  not unruly competition. Far from making it one more focus of human greed  let us preserve its unique value as a precious cradle of life and the repository of the hopes of our planet."
"41",1669,"CRI",64,2009,"Let me begin by sending a warm greeting to Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki  President of the Assembly  on behalf of a country 35 times smaller than his native Libya and infinitely different in scenery and geography. Instead of desert sandstorms we have torrential rains. We know not the waves of the Mediterranean  but the capricious tides of the Caribbean. Its dunes are our forests  its mosques our cathedrals. But I believe that such differences are at the very heart of the United Nations. Aristotle posited that things are distinguished by what they look like. Here  within this haven  nations are similar precisely in that they are distinct  because each is irreplaceable in the vast catalogue of the planet. From the far reaches of this variety that makes us brothers  I wish him the greatest success in this Assembly.  Twenty-three years ago  I spoke for the first time at this rostrum — a rock of reason amidst seas of insanity. At that time  I came here bearing the cries of millions of Central Americans who sought a peaceful solution to the civil wars that were lacerating our region. I came to ask powerful nations to stop the flow of arms fuelling the procession of coffins in our territories  and I came to defend the right of the peoples of Latin America to build their own destiny freely and democratically.  The second time I visited this Hall  I came seeking support for the peace plan that the Presidents of Central America had signed. In those days  no one thought that little Central America would defy the world and choose life in the face of all threats. No one thought that we would have the strength to confront the Powers of the cold war and find our own solution to all our problems. No one thought that we would be able to sow the seeds of democracy in our lands and go on to work for the human development of our peoples. We gave the pessimists and the sceptics a lesson. We refuted with dreams the nightmares that many prophesied for us. Today  I come here to recognize the distance we have travelled and to warn of the risk of backsliding.  Since the last time I spoke before this Assembly  a Central American nation has seen the demon of the coup d’état awaken once again. Our region’s armies have received nearly $60 billion to combat imaginary enemies  while our peoples have struggled empty-handed against the economic crisis. Some leaders have defied democratic rules in the most imaginative ways  while everything that was wrong with our continent has carried on the same  or worse. Poverty has continued to afflict more than a third of our inhabitants. One in three young Latin Americans still has never seen a high-school classroom. Hundreds of thousands of people have died of preventable diseases. The toll of violent death in some of our countries has exceeded those of countries at war  despite the fact that  with the exception of Colombia  there are no armed conflicts in our region. And millions of trees have been felled in territories responsible among them for two thirds of the worldwide forest cover loss in the twenty-first century.  This scenario is not a hopeful one. For those of us from Latin America  it is difficult not to feel that we are always rescuing our future from the clutches of our past  and that we are always trying to take off on a runway where some foolish person spilled oil  long ago. We have not achieved greater development. We have not made our democracy stronger. We have not driven from our reality the shadow of militarism and oppression. These problems recur endemically  to varying degrees  in the majority of developing nations — the very nations that will to a large extent bear the weight of the course of humanity over the next 50 years.  It is the developing nations that will shoulder the worst of the struggle against global warming  that will carry the heaviest burden of population growth on the planet  and that will be responsible for accelerating the growth of a global economy to which the rich cannot contribute much more than they already generate. We do not yet know how the leading role we have been given will play out. Our success or failure will depend on whether we have the courage to take on at least   15 09-52425  three fundamental challenges: the strengthening of our democracies  the encouragement of human development for our peoples through the reduction of military spending and cross-border arms trafficking  and the creation of a new international order for the transfer of aid  information and technology to combat climate change.  Developing nations  and middle-income nations in particular  live simultaneously in the medieval and postmodern eras. In our race to emulate the experiences of developed countries  we have skipped past fundamental steps. There is no doubt that one of these steps is the patient construction of democratic institutions  on which developed countries have spent centuries  while we  if we have been lucky  have spent decades.   As a result  beyond superficial appearances  we lack a true civic culture. We have democratic structures that in many cases are no more than empty shells. We have free elections  but lack the open social forum to allow all citizens freely to make political or ideological contribution. We have formal separation of powers  but in many places power remains a single monopoly disguised in multiple public entities. We have rule of law  but the reach of the law is tested every day by Governments incapable of applying it  when not determined actually to weaken it. We have political constitutions and international treaties that reaffirm our belief in democratic values  but populations still prone to toss those values aside for material gain.  Paraphrasing the great Argentinean writer Jorge Luis Borges  we can say that most inhabitants of developing countries do not identify with the State  which seems to them an abstract concept  removed from their immediate concerns. That is why they allow a Government to end before its constitutional period has elapsed or to continue in power beyond that period. That is why they expect the Government to offer social welfare and public services  but do not recognize the reciprocal obligations of citizens.   That is why they prefer caudillos to political parties  messianic leaders to democratic institutions. That is why they boycott the approval of new taxes in countries whose tax burden is half or even a third of that of developed countries. That is why they so easily fall for a discourse that blames national problems on others instead of assuming responsibility for designing mechanisms that confront them. And this is the best-case scenario  because in the worst there is no democracy at all.  As long as we continue on this path  placing our hopes in developing nations will be like pouring water into a sack. As long as we fail to dedicate more international attention  and more international aid  to strengthening and perfecting democracies in this world  we will watch again and again as our countries try to take off on a slippery runway.  This challenge is even more urgent in the face of an arms race that  year by year  moves $1.3 trillion globally. The combination of strong armies and weak democracies has proved harmful in every corner of the planet  and above all in Latin America  which  during the second half of the twentieth century was a showcase of dictatorial horrors  fuelled by the existence of an omnipresent military apparatus. I will never tire of repeating it: in Latin America  and in a substantial portion of the developing world  armies have served no purpose other than to carry out coups d’état. They have not protected the people; they have oppressed them. They have not safeguarded liberties; they have trampled on them. They have not guaranteed respect for the will of the people; they have mocked it.  What is the threat to our nations? What  for example  is the great enemy of Latin America that compels it to waste $165 million a day on weapons and soldiers? I assure the Assembly that such threats are far less significant than that posed by the mosquito that carries malaria  for instance. They are less significant than the threat posed by the lack of opportunity that pushes our young people into crime. They are less significant than the threat posed by the drug cartels and street gangs that survive thanks to an unrestricted market for small arms and light weapons.  And so what we have to do is order our priorities. Costa Rica was the first country to abolish its army and declare peace on the world. Thanks to that visionary decision  thanks to the liberating army of Commander José Figueres  who renounced arms forever  we have the opportunity today to invest our resources in things that matter. And while we know that not every nation is ready to take such a radical step  we believe that a gradual and progressive reduction in military spending is not only a good strategy for allocating resources  but also a moral imperative for developing nations.  For this reason I ask the Assembly once more to make the Costa Rica Consensus a reality. This    09-52425 16  initiative would create mechanisms for forgiving foreign debt and using international financial resources to support those poor and middle-income developing countries that are investing more in environmental protection  education  health  housing and sustainable development for their people and less in arms and soldiers. And I also ask the Assembly to approve an arms trade treaty  which is known to this Organization  and which seeks to prohibit the transfer of arms to States  groups or individuals when sufficient reason exists to believe that those arms will be used to undermine human rights or international law. I assure members that these two initiatives will make us safer  and certainly more developed  than the costly machinery of death that currently consumes our budgets.  What is more  spending on arms deprives us not only of economic resources. Above all  it deprives us of human resources. At this moment  the greatest arsenal of genius in the world is working on refining the weaponry and defence systems of a few nations. That is not where this genius should be. Its place is in the laboratories where medicines are being created that will be accessible to all humankind. Its place is in the classrooms where the leaders of tomorrow are being formed. Its place is in the Governments that need help in protecting their harvests  their cities and their populations from the effects of global warming.  We have included sustainable development in the Costa Rica Consensus because we believe there is a connection between arms and the protection of the environment. This is  first  because arms and wars generate more environmental devastation and pollution than any productive activity; and secondly  because the very existence of military spending constitutes  in and of itself  a negation of resources available to combat global warming. Every armoured helicopter  every tank  every nuclear submarine represents  in practice  forests that are not protected  technologies that are not becoming less costly and adaptations that are not being made.  Only a few weeks remain before the Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen  where every country will have to undertake commitments much greater than today’s. My small nation  Costa Rica  will attend the conference with its head held high  because unilaterally  and at great sacrifice  we have set ourselves goals that are ever more challenging. We have launched an initiative called Peace with Nature  through which we propose  among other things  to become a carbon-neutral country by the year 2021. This is possible  in large part  thanks to the nearly four decades we have spent protecting our land  replanting our forests and safeguarding our natural species — and also because  at the same time that we abolished our army  we created pioneering institutions devoted to the search for renewable energy sources. Today  more than 95 per cent of our electricity comes from water or wind  from the depths of the Earth or the rays of the sun.  Infinite challenges remain  for Costa Rica as for any other middle-income country. The world’s rich nations  which developed in the most unsustainable way possible  cannot now place limits that choke the development expectations of every other country. Efforts must be directed instead at forming a global platform that allows us to transfer international aid  information and technology efficiently from one nation to another; a platform that will only make sense if the member States of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development increase their official development aid  which today stands at $120 billion per year. When it comes to mitigating and adapting ourselves to global warming the world must share  not compete.  These three challenges — strengthening democracies  reducing military spending and cooperating to confront climate change — perhaps constitute the most ambitious agenda humanity has ever had to take on. Neither I  nor my Government  nor Costa Rica  will ignore this historic call; for we simply cannot fail. We cannot falter. We cannot turn back when we are standing at the vanguard of 6.8 billion human beings.   Like Adam and Eve  we are still living in a heavenly Paradise minutes before being expelled due to our own arrogance. Our sense of responsibility  our humility and our courage will determine whether we waste our opportunity on Earth and squander the miracle of life that has brought us heartbreak and pain yet has also allowed us to know happiness. The greatest of the Costa Rican poets  Jorge Debravo  said that hope is as strong as bone and more powerful than imagination or memory. May that still-present hope give us the strength to embark on the last journey of an unsustainable civilization and the first of a civilization that will survive and outlast us all."
"42",1738,"CUB",64,2009,"I would like to congratulate Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki on his election to the presidency and reiterate our confidence in his ability to conduct our work and our deliberations successfully. I would also like to recognize the excellent leadership of Father Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann  President of the Assembly at its previous session. The ethical dimension and political scope of his presidency have enabled us to move forward towards the goal of restoring to this Assembly all its powers  and will stand as a benchmark for the future. Thanks to his example  it has become even clearer to us now that reforming the United Nations is about democratizing it and bringing it closer to the people.  Since the general debate of one year ago important events have occurred in the international arena. Climate change is now more visible and dangerous. The economic crisis has become intense and global. Social exclusion has increased.  However  the international community reacted with profound optimism to the change of Government in the United States. It seemed that a period of extreme aggressiveness  unilateralism and arrogance in the foreign policy of that country had come to an end and the infamous legacy of the George W. Bush regime had crumbled in repudiation. As those in this very Hall can attest  novel and conciliatory words from the White House raised great hopes  and the world welcomed his repeated messages of change  dialogue and cooperation. Unfortunately  time goes by  and those words do not seem to be supported by concrete facts. The words do not coincide with reality.  The most serious and dangerous aspect of this new situation is the uncertainty about the real capacity of the present authorities in Washington to overpower the sweeping political and ideological currents that threatened the world under the previous Administration. The neoconservative groups that placed George Bush in the presidency — the powers that promoted the use of force and domination under the protection of the colossal military and economic strength of the United States and that are to blame for crimes including torture  assassination and the manipulation of the American people — have quickly regrouped and retain immense resources of power and influence  contrary to the change proclaimed.  The detention and torture centre at the Guantánamo Bay Naval Base — which usurps Cuban territory — has not been shut down. The occupation troops in Iraq have not been withdrawn. The war in Afghanistan is expanding and is threatening other States.   As for Cuba  which has suffered American aggression for half a century  last April the new United States Government announced measures to abolish some of the Bush Administration’s most brutal actions that prohibited contact between Cubans living in the United States and their relatives in Cuba  particularly the possibility to visit them and to send assistance without limitations. These measures are a positive step  but they are extremely limited and insufficient.  The announced measures included authorizing American companies to carry out certain telecommunications operations with Cuba  but other restrictions that prevent the implementation of those operations have not been modified. Nor has there been any sign that the United States Government is ready to put an end to the immoral practice — which has recently increased — of misappropriating Cuban funds frozen in American banks  as well as other goods  under the protection of venal judges who violate their own laws.  The essential fact is that the economic  commercial and financial blockade of Cuba remains in place. The United States President  despite the existence of laws such as the Helms-Burton Act  still has broad executive powers  such as the granting of licenses  by means of which he could modify the implementation of the blockade.   If there were a true desire for change  the United States Government could authorize the export of Cuban goods and services to the United States and vice versa. The United States could allow Cuba to buy anywhere in the world products comprised of more than 10 per cent American components or technology  regardless of trademark or country of origin. The United States Department of the Treasury could refrain from pursuing  freezing and confiscating third-country transfers in United States dollars and other currencies to Cuban nationals or entities. Washington could lift the ban preventing third-country vessels from docking at any American port until 180 days after calling at any Cuban port. The Treasury Department’s persecution of financial institutions and companies that trade with or   17 09-52598  carry out operations in Cuba could also be suspended. President Obama could allow American citizens  by means of a license  to travel to Cuba — the only country in the world they are not allowed to visit.  The Secretary-General’s report to the Assembly (A/64/97) abounds with examples. In the course of 2009 numerous fines  confiscations and other hindrances have been levelled at trade carried out by Cuba or by third countries with Cuba. As the United States Treasury Department itself has reported  since January this year almost half of the funds collected by its Office of Foreign Assets Control came from sanctions imposed on American and foreign companies for alleged violations of the economic blockade against Cuba.   The true and indisputable fact is that the new American Government continues to ignore the international community’s overwhelming appeal  expressed in this Assembly year after year  to put an end to the blockade of Cuba. Two weeks ago President Obama instructed the Secretaries of State and the Treasury that  contrary to what is reflected in all American opinion polls  “it is in the national interest” to maintain economic sanctions against Cuba under the Trading with the Enemy Act — a law enacted in 1917 to address wartime situations and which is today applied only to Cuba. The United States blockade of Cuba is an act of unilateral aggression that should be unilaterally terminated.   For many years Cuba has expressed its willingness to normalize relations with the United States. On 1 August 2009  President Raúl Castro Ruz publicly reiterated Cuba’s readiness to participate in a respectful dialogue  between equals  with the United States — a dialogue that assumes our independence  sovereignty and self-determination. He emphasized that we should mutually respect our differences and that Cuba does not recognize that the Government of that or any other country  or any other group of States  has any jurisdiction over our internal affairs.   The Government of Cuba has suggested to the United States Government a set of essential topics it considers must necessarily be discussed during a future dialogue aimed at improving relations. Those topics include the lifting of the economic  commercial and financial blockade; the removal of Cuba from the spurious list of terrorist countries; the revocation of the Cuban Adjustment Act and of the “wet foot  dry foot” policy; compensation for economic and human damages; the return of the territory occupied by the Guantánamo Bay Naval Base; the end of all radio and television aggression from United States territory against Cuba; and the cessation of American funding of domestic subversion.   An essential item on that agenda is the release of the five Cuban anti-terrorism fighters who have been unjustly imprisoned in the United States for 11 years. President Obama has the constitutional prerogatives to free them as an act of justice and of his Government’s commitment against terrorism.  The President returned to the Chair.  Furthermore  we have proposed to the United States to begin talks on setting up cooperation to tackle drug trafficking  terrorism and human smuggling  protect the environment and address natural disasters. In that spirit  the Cuban Government has held talks with that of the United States on migration and on the establishment of direct postal services. Those talks have been courteous and useful.  Cuba enjoys extensive and fruitful relations in all parts of the world. With the single exception of the United States  Cuba has friendly relations with all countries of this hemisphere and counts on the solidarity of the region. We cooperate with dozens of countries of Africa  Asia  Latin America and the Caribbean.  Ours is a stable country with a united  cultured and healthy people who have amply proven that  even under an embargo  they are capable of facing the consequences of the global economic crisis and the effects of climate change  which last year cost the national economy 20 per cent of its gross domestic product.  Conditions in Cuba are such that it can face its own problems and find solutions to them. We do so in a just and fair society that relies on its own efforts and has been able to advance and guide its development in the most adverse conditions. We are ready to continue facing those challenges calmly and patiently  confident that no citizen has been or will be abandoned and certain that we are defending a cause of national independence and a socialist plan that have the huge support of the Cubans. Anyone who tries to stop the revolution and bend the will of the Cuban people is suffering from delusions. Patriotism  social justice and    09-52598 18  the resolve to defend independence are all part of our national identity.  Latin America and the Caribbean are in a dramatic situation  characterized by the sharp contradiction between the large majorities — which  together with progressive Governments and broad social movements  are demanding justice and fairness — and the traditional oligarchies committed to preserving their privileges. The coup d’état in Honduras demonstrates that. Those who participated in the coup and the usurpers who kidnapped the legitimate President of that country are violating the constitution and brutally repressing the people  as happened in the dark years of the military dictatorships in Latin America propped up by the United States. Hundreds of thousands of assassinated  missing and tortured persons are stirring the conscience of our America in the face of impunity.   It has still not been explained why the plane that kidnapped the constitutional President of Honduras made a stopover at the American Palmerola air base. The American fascist right  which Cheney symbolizes  openly supports and defends the coup. President José Manuel Zelaya must be fully  immediately and unconditionally reinstated to the execution of his constitutional duties. The inviolability of the Brazilian Embassy in Tegucigalpa must be respected and the siege of and the attacks on its property must stop. The Honduran people are valiantly resisting and will have the last word.  Those events coincide with the renewed and aggressive interest of the United States in setting up military bases in Latin America and in re-establishing the Fourth Fleet  clearly with the aim of putting the region within only a few hours’ reach of American troops  threatening the revolutionary and progressive movements  in particular the Bolivarian revolution in the sister nation of Venezuela  and gaining control of the region’s oil and other natural resources.  The slander and lies against the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela are brutal. It should be recalled that it was thus when atrocious aggression emerged and was instigated against our fatherland. The broader and clearer the policy towards that sister nation  the more it will contribute to the peace  independence and development of the peoples of Latin America and the Caribbean.  Latin America and the Caribbean can advance and  to a certain extent  are moving forward to new and higher forms of integration. They have more water  land  forests and mineral and energy resources than any other region of the planet. Their population exceeds 570 million. The Rio Group  the Latin American and Caribbean Summit on Integration and Development and the Union of South American Nations are bodies set up by virtue of the ties that unite us. The Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our Americas and the Petrocaribe cooperation scheme are prime examples.  The optimistic forecasts from Pittsburgh on the progression of the global economic crisis  which predict a possible economic recovery early next year  are not based on solid data and  at best  only indicate relief from collapse for a very limited group of the world’s most powerful economies. It is worth noting that objectives have been set but not a word has been said about how to achieve them.  No one should forget that what is involved is an unprecedented crisis of the capitalist system that encompasses the respective food  energy  ecological  social and financial crises. Nor should we overlook the danger of debt combined with inflation  of the bursting of other financial bubbles  or of a second collapse. The developing countries are not to blame  but are the victims of the consequences of the unreasonable and unsustainable model of consumption  exploitation and speculation  the attack on the environment and the corruption in the industrialized economies.  While the debates go on  the number of hungry people will reach a record figure of 1 020 million in 2009 — a sixth of the world’s population. This year  another 90 million will be cast into poverty and  50 million others into unemployment. During these months  another 400 000 children are expected to die as a result of the crisis.  The measures that have been adopted are only palliative ones that perpetuate the serious deficiencies of an unjust  exclusive and ecologically unsustainable international economic system. We need a fully comprehensive and inclusive international dialogue with the active participation of all developing countries. We need to establish a new international economic order based on solidarity  justice  equality and sustainable development. The international financial architecture should be founded anew. The   19 09-52598  United Nations  particularly this General Assembly  is called upon to play a key role in this endeavour.  In conclusion  I reiterate Cuba’s gratitude for the traditional and invaluable solidarity it has received from this General Assembly in its struggle against aggression and the blockade. Today  that solidarity remains as indispensable as ever.  As Commander in Chief Fidel Castro Ruz said from this very rostrum nine years ago:    “Nothing in the existing economic and political order serves the interests of humankind. Thus this order is unsustainable and must be changed. Suffice it to say that the world has already more than 6 billion inhabitants  80 per cent of whom live in poverty. Ages-old diseases of the third world — diseases such as malaria  tuberculosis and others equally lethal — have not been eradicated  while new epidemics like AIDS threaten to exterminate the population of entire nations … Meanwhile  wealthy countries keep devoting enormous amounts of money to military expenses and to buy luxury items  and a voracious plague of speculators exchange currencies  stocks and other real or fictitious values for trillions of dollars every day.   “Nature is being devastated. The climate is changing under our own eyes  and drinking water is increasingly contaminated or scarce. The seas  a source of human sustenance  are being depleted  and crucial non-renewable resources are being wasted on luxury and vanities …   “The dream of having truly fair and sensible norms to guide human destiny seems impossible to many. However  we are convinced that the struggle for the impossible should be the motto of this institution that brings us together today.” (A/55/PV.4  p. 20)  Despite everything  the fiftieth anniversary of the Cuban Revolution is being celebrated victoriously and with pride."
"43",1784,"CYP",64,2009,"I would like to extend to Mr. Ali Treki my sincere congratulations on his election as President of the sixty-fourth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. I would also like to express my appreciation for the excellent work done by his predecessor  Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann. I should also like to thank the Secretary-General for his comprehensive report (A/64/1) on the work of the Organization  as well as to congratulate him on his initiative in convening the high-level Climate Change Summit.  Since its independence  the Republic of Cyprus has been committed to multilateral diplomacy and the strengthening of the role of the United Nations. World stability and welfare have been threatened by the recent global economic crisis. The crisis revealed the weaknesses of our collective oversight systems. It is only through collective international action  and not through economic nationalism  that we can overcome such challenges. The same is true of action against disease and poverty  as well as the prevention of further damage to the environment  which affects the lives of us all.  The most important lesson to be learned from the financial crisis is that the economy cannot be seen in isolation from the needs of society. Despite the remarkable development of production forces that could have secured decent living conditions for all  people in many parts of the world are still deprived of basic needs such as drinking water  health care and access to education and work. The magnitude of the financial crisis shows that it is a crisis of the system and of its most extreme manifestation  namely  neo-liberalism and market lawlessness. In its present form  globalization is not the realization of the vision of philosophers and social revolutionaries for global brotherhood and prosperity for all. That is because globalization is driven by the pursuit of excessive profits. As a result  the rich are becoming richer and the poor poorer.  More than half way to the 2015 deadline for the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals  the financial crisis is forcing States and institutions to reassess global priorities. The United Nations is the most important international body able to tackle the effects of the global financial crisis and to act collectively and effectively to prevent their most dire consequences.  The world today faces multiple challenges and threats  including climate change  the depletion of resources  human rights abuses  the failure to protect vulnerable populations  increased regional and inter-State conflict  the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and pandemics. From this rostrum  we have heard the desperate voices of those who live on small-island States  the despairing appeal of young people and the dramatic warnings of scientists about climate change. If we do not take measures now  we face the risk of extinction. We join our voice and lend our support to the proposals for taking concrete action. We must take measures now. Tomorrow will be too late. The December meeting in Copenhagen must become a historic turning point in effectively addressing catastrophic climate change.  Since its independence  the Republic of Cyprus has relied on the principles of the United Nations in maintaining its independence  its sovereignty and its territorial integrity. After the dual crime of a military coup and the foreign invasion of Cyprus in 1974  when military forces attempted to obliterate our statehood and violated the integrity of our State  the United Nations responded with a number of important resolutions that expressed the international community’s moral and legal support for the Republic of Cyprus. The plethora of Security Council and General Assembly resolutions on Cyprus provided my country with the necessary support to continue its struggle for a solution to its political problem on the basis of those resolutions  the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international law.  Shortly after my election to office  I undertook the initiative of bringing the stalemate to an end. As a result of that  and on the basis of the relevant Security Council resolutions and under the auspices of the good offices mission of the Secretary-General  a year ago we embarked upon intensive negotiations with the leader of the Turkish Cypriot community  Mr. Mehmet Ali Talat.   Trusting in the sincerity of Mr. Talat’s intentions  we have engaged in a common effort to bring an end to the division of our country. We agreed that the process would be in the hands of Cypriots  without arbitration or artificial timetables. Some progress has been achieved in the negotiations  but not such as to make us confident that we are close to a final solution to the Cyprus problem. Our goal is the restoration of the sovereignty  territorial integrity  independence and   09-52320 14  unity of the Republic of Cyprus  the common homeland of Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots. It is also our goal to restore the human rights and basic freedoms of all citizens of the Republic of Cyprus  regardless of their ethnic background.  We are committed to the evolution of the unitary State into a federal State consisting of two largely autonomous regions. One region will be administered by the Greek Cypriot community and the other by the Turkish Cypriot community. The fact that the population of Cyprus lived intermingled throughout the island constituted for us a great historical concession on the part of the late President Makarios to our Turkish Cypriot compatriots. We remain true to that commitment. The united federal republic of Cyprus must safeguard the unity of the State and its institutions  as well as of the economy and the people.  Unfortunately  despite our common efforts  the Turkish Cypriot side  supported by Turkey  continues to present positions and proposals that take us outside the framework of the United Nations resolutions on Cyprus with regard to the termination of military occupation  the illegal possession of properties and the presence of settlers. Acceptance of those positions would lead to acceptance of many consequences of the occupation and to violations of international conventions on human rights  basic freedoms and the principles on which federations are built. It is clear that such a solution would be neither viable nor functional and would not ensure the continuing unity of the State and the country.  We sincerely hope that during the second round of negotiations  which has just started  the Turkish positions will be reconsidered so that we can  as soon as possible  reach an agreed solution that we can then present to the people in separate simultaneous referendums. That solution must be by the Cypriots for the Cypriots. It is clear that we will not present to the people a solution that originates from outside  nor can we accept arbitration or pressure being exercised through artificial timetables.   Those preconditions were agreed with the Secretary-General  under whose auspices the negotiations are taking place. I would like to take this opportunity to thank once again the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  for his good offices mission and for the role of the United Nations as a facilitator in the negotiating process.  After the 1974 invasion and the occupation of 30 per cent of the territory of the Republic of Cyprus  Turkey has become a key player in the solution of the Cyprus problem. The success of our efforts towards a solution of the problem depends on Turkey’s political will and on the policies that it implements. It is not enough for the Turkish leadership to publicly state that it supports the negotiating process.  Turkey should contribute in a practical way to a solution that seeks a bizonal and bicommunal federation with political equality  as defined in the relevant Security Council resolutions. Instead  Turkey pursues a confederal solution. A measure of goodwill on the part of Turkey would have been the implementation of Security Council resolution 550 (1984)  which stipulates the transfer of the occupied ghost town of Varosha to the administration of the United Nations and the return of its legal inhabitants to their homes and property. In addition  Turkey should proceed with normalizing its relations with the Republic of Cyprus and with recognizing it  as stipulated in the decisions of the European Union.  I ask if it is not a paradox for a country that is a member of the Security Council not to recognize the Republic of Cyprus  a State Member of the United Nations  of the European Union and of all international organizations. Is it not a paradox for a member of the Security Council to keep occupation troops on the territory of another United Nations Member State and a member State of the European Union for 35 years? Is it not a paradox to undermine the unity and the territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus by promoting the creation of a second State on the island in violation of Security Council resolution 541 (1983)  which unanimously condemns the illegal unilateral declaration of independence  calling it null and void  and calls on all States to respect the sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus?  Yes  it is a paradox  and it is also illegal. Cyprus has never sought  nor wishes  to have hostile relations with its neighbour  Turkey  but it is our responsibility to defend the independence  territorial integrity and sovereignty of our State.  Nevertheless  before this body  I would like to express my readiness to initiate dialogue with the Turkish leadership  in parallel to our negotiations with Turkish Cypriot leader  and to share ideas on a future   15 09-52320  that would greatly enhance the possibility of a positive outcome to the negotiations. Cyprus has consistently supported Turkey’s accession to the European Union in the belief that the entire adaptation process and Turkey’s eventual membership would benefit our neighbours  our region and us. However  that support is not unconditional. Turkey should fulfil its obligations towards the Republic of Cyprus and towards the European Union.  I would like to state once again that our Turkish Cypriot compatriots are equal citizens of the Republic of Cyprus and that I personally will consistently strive for their rights and for finding their rightful place in all organs of the State. My political roots are in the progressive people’s movement of my country  which has always stood by our Turkish Cypriot compatriots for peace and harmonious coexistence.   Nevertheless  the rights of our Turkish Cypriot compatriots cannot be implemented at the expense of those of the larger community  which is the Greek Cypriot one. There must be mutual respect. I want to affirm that I will spare no effort in order to achieve a balanced and just solution that would restore the rights of the people as a whole.   We have all paid a heavy price — human  political and economic — and continue to do so. The gains of lasting peace will benefit the people of Cyprus  of Turkey and of our region as a whole. True political leaders are not those who think of the next election  but of the next generation. We have the responsibility to work together to achieve a lasting peace in our region.  I wish the family of the United Nations a successful outcome to the deliberations of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session."
"44",1808,"CZE",64,2009,"My country  the Czech Republic  has always appreciated the role that the United Nations has played in strengthening security  stability and prosperity in the world. I want to assure Members that we will continue to participate in the activities of the United Nations. We firmly believe in the importance of this Organization and want it to be efficient and effective. For that reason  we support the reform of the Security Council so that it will more adequately reflect the political and economic realities of the world today  as some speakers have stressed here today. Changes are necessary and we are ready to start discussing them very seriously.  This year  in our part of the world  we commemorate 20 years since the fall of communism  since the moment when my country — together with other States of Central and Eastern Europe — regained freedom and sovereignty  and was again able to resume the place in the community of free and democratic countries that it enjoyed when the United Nations was founded in 1945.  In the 20 years that have passed since those historic events  we succeeded in building a stable political democracy and in transforming our economic system into a functioning free-market economy. I am mentioning this because I believe that our experience is relevant to the ongoing discussions about how to solve the economic problems that the world faces today.  We are meeting at a time when the world is in the midst one of the deepest economic crises since the Second World War. The financial crisis  which originated in the United States two years ago  quickly spilled over into most other countries and led to a severe decline in economic activity all over the world  a substantial decrease in international trade and capital flows and an increase in social and economic instability in a large number of countries on all continents.  The United Nations — as a unique worldwide Organization — and its specialized institutions have become an important global platform for discussing alternative steps and policies that could  one hopes  help to overcome the crisis and diminish its impact. The measures that have been implemented to date have contributed to the fact that the world has succeeded in avoiding a repetition of the situation in the 1930s. We also succeeded in avoiding a repetition of a massive protectionist reaction to the crisis. Protectionism in all its forms should be resolutely condemned here today.  We see the first signs that the economic crisis has reached bottom  or come close to it. Nevertheless  we find ourselves at the beginning of a difficult and very complicated post-crisis period. There are many reasons for the fragility and vulnerability of this phase  but I should like to refer to just a few.  First  attempts to increase aggregate demand led to unprecedented expansion in public expenditure and public debt. As a result  a large number of United Nations Member States are facing or approaching a debt trap. Those huge fiscal deficits will harm future economic growth. Secondly  international flows of private capital  which contributed so substantially to rapid economic growth in recent decades  are decreasing and becoming less reliable. Thirdly  a decrease in international trade will undermine the continuation of export-oriented strategies of many emerging markets.  It would be a tragic mistake to fundamentally impair economic freedom in favour of State or supra-State regulation just now. Long-term experience shows us that it is thanks to free markets and free entrepreneurship that we enjoy the current material well-being and economic progress. Business cycles  accompanied by economic downturns  recessions and   23 09-52228  crises  did exist  do exist and will exist in the future. In spite of them  the world has been — at least in the past two centuries — characterized primarily by economic growth and growing prosperity.   When looking for an appropriate reaction to the problems connected with the current crisis  we should build on the idea that the crisis was basically a failure of Governments  not of markets. The manipulation of monetary policy in an attempt to artificially prolong the period of growth  the irrational subsidization of demand in the housing sector and the failures in financial-market regulation contributed substantially to the crisis. Let us not delude ourselves into believing that economic cycles and their consequences can be prevented by more extensive Government regulation or by aiming at global governance of the world economy.  This issue has its important territorial and geographic aspects as well. We have to pay attention to the needs and interests of all kinds of countries — rich and poor  developed and developing. Global economic development will benefit from the removal of barriers  not from creating new ones  because barriers would substantially complicate poorer countries’ access to foreign markets  as well as their ability to develop by their own means.  Economic recession and large increases in public debt have reduced the possibilities available to today’s world to meet such goals as combating climate change. I do not intend to go into details of this issue here now  but we should carefully follow it because of unfinished scientific debate and pay attention to the costs and benefits of our future decisions.  I do  however  want to emphasize that the measures proposed to combat climate change represent another heavy burden for both developed countries  which are falling into deep fiscal deficits now  and for developing countries. This is happening in a context in which rich countries  often pushing this agenda at international forums  are losing their ability to compensate poorer countries for the impact of those additional costs.  The Czech Republic  as a successor State to Czechoslovakia  which was one of the founding Members of the United Nations  has always participated actively in all kinds of United Nations activities. It intends to do so in the future as well. It is in our interest that the Organization remains a respected high-level forum that contributes to prosperity  stability and peaceful solutions to the conflicts of today’s world."
"45",1870,"DEU",64,2009,"In these tumultuous times marked by manifold crises  we are more than ever in need of a global Organization that all Members make use of and support. We need the United Nations. The comprehensive  universal system of the United Nations forms the heart of the global system of crisis prevention and mitigation. Now more than ever  Germany pledges its active and extensive support to this world Organization.  This past year taught us bitter lessons  and today it seems clearer than ever: we must secure the sustainability of the economic recovery. That applies not only to the financial sector  but also  and in particular  to the most vulnerable in the world — the poorest of the poor in the developing countries — as well as to our environment and the world’s climate.  The consultations on a charter for sustainable economic activity point in the right direction. The United Nations should be actively involved in that process. We must turn the crisis into an opportunity for development and a truly green recovery.  The aftermath of the financial crisis is jeopardizing our progress on the path towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals. Therefore  we must do our utmost to avoid any setbacks in that regard. Donor States must continue their efforts for development  all the more so in times of crisis. Germany has continually increased its official development assistance contributions in recent years. In 2008  my country was the second-largest donor of official development assistance. We will also significantly increase our contributions to the multilateral development banks.  All of this underscores one thing: Germany  as one of the world’s largest economies  stands by its global responsibility. But developing countries must also live up to their responsibilities. Responsible governance  respect for human rights  environmental protection  the fight against epidemics  the strengthening of the rights of women — those are the challenges that each country has the responsibility to meet.  Climate change is the pre-eminent challenge of the twenty-first century. It threatens our well-being  our security and our economic development. It will lead to uncontrollable risks and dramatic damage  if we do not take resolute action — not in some distant future  but right now.  I can assure the Assembly: Germany will continue to be a leader in climate protection. But we will be successful only if we act together. We need an inclusive process in which those countries directly affected by climate change  such as the small island States  can also play a part. The United Nations is the only reliable framework for this. I would like to thank the Secretary-General for his very timely initiative in convening a United Nations summit last week addressing this key issue.  Disarmament and arms control can help create better conditions for global cooperation and increase security and stability. We warmly welcome the new dynamic in the area of nuclear disarmament. The call for a nuclear-weapon-free world enjoys widespread support  including that of Germany. We must seize this opportunity for progress in all areas of disarmament. Germany has underlined that sub-strategic nuclear weapons must also be incorporated into the continuing process of disarmament. Our clear commitment to ridding the world of all nuclear weapons is the best way to strengthen the international non-proliferation regime.  We need a new international consensus at the 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)  the launching of negotiations in Geneva on a fissile material cut-off treaty and the entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. In order to avoid a conflict of objectives between non-proliferation and peaceful uses  Germany supports multilateral solutions to nuclear-fuel supply and has put forward its own proposal on that issue.  The international community must not relent in its commitment to banning all weapons of mass destruction. A model in that respect is the Chemical Weapons Convention  which outlaws a whole category of weapons of mass destruction. Its implementing organization needs strong and dynamic leadership. Germany has always had a particular commitment to   55 09-52604  the Chemical Weapons Convention  and we stand ready to accept greater responsibility in that organization.  We view the ongoing nuclear programme in Iran with great concern. The belated admittance by Iran concerning the construction of a second enrichment plant underlines the fact that our concerns are more than justified. Even before this latest event  the report by International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director-General El Baradei emphasized the urgency of the matter. Unfortunately  the Iranian Government still refuses to cooperate fully with the IAEA and to remove serious doubts concerning the peaceful character of its nuclear programme. We urge Iran to grant an IAEA verification team access to the newly disclosed site without delay.  We sincerely hope that Iran will use the opportunity of the upcoming talks between it and the E3+3 — the United Kingdom  France and Germany  plus the United States  the Russian Federation and China — to demonstrate its willingness to engage in honest and speedy negotiations. If Iran’s leaders continue to stall  the international community will have no other choice but to take additional measures to emphasize the seriousness of our common concern.  Iran has a long and great history. It witnessed the origins of civilization. It can become an anchor of stability in its region — a respected member of the international community. But that involves  in addition to a diplomatic resolution of questions regarding its nuclear programme  a responsible foreign policy towards its neighbours. The key to this is the recognition of Israel’s right to exist.  Since the escalation of violence in the Gaza Strip at the beginning of the year  we have seen some encouraging signs of a return to the peace process. The resumption of negotiations aimed at the two-State solution is still possible. Germany strongly supports President Obama’s intensive commitment and regional approach. Together with the partners of the European Union  we are prepared to support efforts towards peace through concrete contributions. What we now need  however  are courageous gestures of goodwill on all sides to create the conditions for serious talks.  The successful holding of elections in June was an important milestone towards the continuing stabilization of Lebanon. What is now important is that a new Government soon be formed. The successful United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) mission remains a crucial contribution to securing the ceasefire between Lebanon and Israel  and thus to the stabilization of the region. By again assuming command of the UNIFIL Maritime Task Force on 1 September  we further strengthened our commitment to UNIFIL.  For Afghanistan  2009 is a pivotal year. The presidential elections — the first elections in decades that were free and organized by the Afghans themselves — determined who will control the fate of the country over the next five years. They were an impressive sign of the resolve of the people of Afghanistan to take part in the political process.  Against the backdrop of the difficult security situation  the further build-up of Afghan security forces assumes even greater importance. We will  therefore  continue to increase the number of German police instructors in Afghanistan  we will support the further build-up of the European Union Police Mission  and we will help to advance the training of the Afghan army within the framework of the International Security Assistance Force.  Despite all the criticism  there are also encouraging accomplishments  especially in the field of economic growth and in the reconstruction of the country’s infrastructure. The basic prerequisites for Afghanistan’s sustainable development are good governance  a resolute fight against corruption and an improvement in State services. These are essential if the population is to once again nurture hope for the future. As one of the largest troop-contributing nations and one of the main bilateral donors  Germany will continue to play an instrumental role in the reconstruction of the country.  Following the presidential elections  we are now entering a new phase of cooperation between the international community and Afghanistan. For that reason  Germany  together with the United Kingdom and France  has taken the initiative to hold an international conference that will set out concrete  realistic and measurable goals for the future political and economic development of Afghanistan. To that end  the Afghanistan Compact  which will expire in 2010  should be further developed.  In 2010  we will celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the independence of no fewer than 17 African States — a fitting moment to also look to the future. Despite the global economic crisis  the overall outlook    09-52604 56  for Africa and its people is positive. We must succeed in utilizing the continent’s enormous potential in terms of people  creativity and resources. It remains our challenge to support the development of that potential while  at the same time  respecting African ownership.  African ownership should by no means be equated with a withdrawal from our neighbouring continent. On the contrary  it means that we should cultivate relations with the States of Africa in a spirit of partnership — a partnership in which each side introduces its ideas  and in which we work together to master the challenges we face  whether locally or globally.  One major common challenge remains the containment of violence and the protection of people in conflict areas. Germany will continue its extensive engagement in Africa  be it in the area of development cooperation  peace and security  business and technology  the environmental and energy sector or educational and scientific cooperation. This also applies to cooperation with the African Union  which has been expanding increasingly in recent years.  United Nations peacekeeping missions are a central pillar of the international security architecture. Reform of United Nations peacekeeping is an urgent issue  and Germany is ready to actively contribute to such reform.  It is absolutely essential that the cooperation between the United Nations and regional organizations be further intensified. The European Union has just shown that  with its peacekeeping missions in Africa — those in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Chad  to name just two examples — it is a reliable partner of the United Nations when it comes to crisis management.  We are facing a multitude of global challenges. Today  no country is strong enough to tackle those challenges on its own. We need a universal forum for joint global action. That is why we need a strong United Nations that is capable of taking effective action.  A long chain of high-level meetings — from the 2005 High-level Event to the Secretary-General’s Summit on Climate Change last week — has emphasized how urgent it is to adapt the United Nations to the challenges of today’s world  for threats have become global. Our responses  however  are still not always global  and that is true for the United Nations as well.  Reforms must start with simple questions. Does a particular body effectively fulfil its tasks? Does its composition reflect the world of today? Where that is not the case  reform must have a clear objective: to make the United Nations more effective  more credible and more assertive.  However  we must not limit reforms to the United Nations. If we want to deal effectively with the current crisis and effectively prevent future crises  we must also reform the international financial institutions. Isolated reforms of individual institutions will not get us anywhere. Reform of the financial institutions and of the United Nations must intermesh as a broader reform of global governance — a reform that  more than six decades after the founding of today’s world order  is long overdue. Germany  incidentally  is advocating at a high level the improved representation of newly industrialized and developing countries as part of the reform of the international financial institutions. This is our understanding of global governance: fair participation for everybody.  In 2000 and 2005  heads of State and Government called for reform of the Security Council. They did so out of the realization that we can meet the threats of today only if the Council reflects the world of today. One thing is clear: if the Security Council does not reform itself  there is a risk that other bodies will attempt to take its place. Such a rivalry would be detrimental to us all. Let us therefore attempt  at this sixty-fourth session of the General Assembly  to bring about concrete results.  Germany has been and remains willing to take responsibility. That includes assuming a permanent seat on a reformed Security Council. We also underline this readiness to take responsibility with our candidacy for a non-permanent seat on the Council for the period 2011-2012. Through our work in the Security Council  we want to contribute to the success of the United Nations  just as we are already contributing to worldwide United Nations missions  to development funds  humanitarian aid and the United Nations Environment Programme. Now and in the future  we will work to find common interests  to overcome divisions and to strengthen a global partnership of responsibility."
"46",1903,"DJI",64,2009,"I would like to begin by extending my warmest congratulations to the President on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its current session. I also take this opportunity to place on record our sincere appreciation of Father Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann for his efforts and leadership during the sixty-third session. I wish as well to commend the Secretary-General for his comprehensive report on the work of the Organization and for his tireless efforts and dedication in the cause of international peace and security.  The current financial and economic crisis affecting many countries around the globe  particularly in the West  has reached the shores of Africa. Originating in the West  the uncontrolled banking and mortgage crisis  arising from over-leveraged subprime lending schemes  burst into the open  destroying the liquidity and survivability of many institutions in the developed countries.  It was thought that  since Africa was not a player in this sector  its financial institutions and its economies would escape more or less unscathed. Such was not to be; African difficulties have been compounded. This crisis follows on the heels of the food and energy crises and the challenges posed by the impacts of climate change. The severity of the crisis on poor countries cannot be underestimated. Poor countries have no choice but to work hard to restore strong growth and recover lost ground in order to move towards internationally agreed development goals. In this respect  it must be emphasized that the global   15 09-53165  crisis cannot be an excuse to avoid fulfilling existing international aid commitments. In addition to timely delivery  flexibility of resources and predictability  it is critical that the aid be effective. Developing countries need access to new funding  including credit and liquidity facilities  infrastructure investment and support for domestic financial systems.  Members of the General Assembly are by now aware of the tense standoff that prevails in the northern part of my country  following the unwarranted and deliberately provocative incursion and occupation by Eritrean forces of Djibouti’s sovereign territory at the beginning of last year  2008. This wholly reckless action by Eritrea  a neighbour  provoked a mutual military build-up  leading to serious clashes between the two forces. In particular  the clashes of 10 to 12 June 2008 resulted in many deaths  countless wounded and prisoners taken on both sides  and this merits a special note.  My country embarked upon a calm and prudent policy that deliberately allowed sufficient time for the possibility of comprehensive bilateral contacts at every level in order to resolve hostilities amicably and peacefully. Our efforts fell consistently on deaf ears  accompanied by rebuffs  blatant denials  and dismissive and condescending utterances. Regional organizations  heads of State and Government  and the United Nations have all attempted to initiate dialogue; these efforts have gone for naught with Eritrea  which  in its usual brazen manner  has gone so far as to deny even the existence of any tension in the area  despite the clear  far-reaching and unmistakable conclusions of the United Nations fact-finding mission. Indeed  the mission’s report represents a damning indictment of the regime’s deceptive and erratic behaviour.  The Security Council has consistently condemned Eritrea’s forceful occupation of my country’s territory  namely  Ras Doumeira and Doumeira Island  and in resolution 1862 (2009) of 14 January 2009  demanded  inter alia  that Eritrea withdraw its forces and all their military hardware to the status quo ante; acknowledge its border dispute with Djibouti; engage actively in dialogue to defuse the tension and in diplomatic efforts leading to a mutually acceptable settlement; and to abide by its obligations as a Member of the United Nations.  The resolution required Eritrea to comply immediately  and  in any case no later than five weeks after the resolution’s adoption date of 14 January. Eritrea  however  rejected the resolution the next day. There the matter has essentially remained  in the light of the series of requests made by the Secretariat for more time to pursue contacts  particularly with the Eritrean authorities. As everyone now realizes  it is a futile exercise to seek a credible response from Eritrea  whose intentions have always been to procrastinate on various pretexts while firmly entrenching itself in the occupied territory.  As Djibouti has repeatedly stated  the occupied areas of Ras Doumeira hill  which overlooks the Bab-El-Mandeb strait  and Doumeira Island  which is in the same Red Sea area  are situated in one of the busiest shipping lanes in the world. The militarization of this key strategic maritime route does not augur well for peace in the region or for international shipping and investment.  The dispute between Eritrea and Djibouti must not be allowed to fester any longer. It must be resolved along the lines of Security Council resolution 1862 (2009) without further equivocation  confusion or deliberate procrastination. Inaction sets a dangerous precedent that others will surely follow in the future: deny and refuse to cooperate. The Council must not appear to be appeasing Eritrea indefinitely. It is a dangerous and an unpredictable regime that so far has not shown any respect for international norms and behaviour. The Council must act now  using all means at its disposal.  Once again  the situation in Somalia is tense  tenuous and unpredictable. Somalia’s plight is sickening  hopeless and disgusting  to say the least. Here we have a transitional Government that enjoys the full backing of the international community. Yet paradoxically  that same entity is woefully lacking the money and manpower that would enable it to confront the deadly insurrection that has paralysed the whole country. Mogadishu  the capital  is essentially a war zone. Most of its civilian population has been displaced  having fled the never-ending anarchy  abuses  impunity and other egregious crimes against humanity. The collateral damage to the civilian population is horrendous — in short  unquantifiable. Coupled with that  the Somali people are facing an extreme drought that threatens a widespread food shortage and starvation  which would necessitate major international emergency food aid.   09-53165 16   The presence of African Union peacekeepers has been a major factor in keeping the transitional Government in power  but they are continuously under attack  and the need for more troops  as well as for the training and equipping of sufficient Somali forces  cannot be overemphasized. Indeed  there is tremendous goodwill towards the current Transitional Federal Government  in particular towards Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed  the current President  who enjoys both trust and international credibility. Unfortunately  that has not been matched by a commensurate support in terms of resource flows consistent with the promises and pledges made to the Government. Resources make the difference in the outcome of hostilities.   All the same  life in Somalia goes on  and with resources that country would be able to start addressing the critical urgent problems and issues of security  governance and job creation. Addressing the terrible drought now battering the country and crippling its already low food stock is a top priority. We must all fulfil our obligations to enable the Government to function. No doubt that is a tall order  but that is what it takes and that is the challenge that we all have to confront.   We are well aware of the flow of arms  resources and foreign fighters into Somalia and of the threat that Al-Qaida might establish a beachhead there. One can say that the time has come for all well-meaning Somalis  as well as peoples and Governments of goodwill everywhere  to step forward in order to create a lasting and stable environment for the people of Somalia. We owe that to the people of Somalia.  The stage appears set for dramatic developments in the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories  which is by far the longest occupation in modern times. As we all know  the United Nations Fact-Finding Mission investigating last winter’s three-week war in Gaza has issued its report. While both the Israelis and the Palestinians were strongly criticized  the condemnation of Israel by a United Nations body was unprecedented  stating that the result was  “a deliberately disproportionate attack designed to punish  humiliate and terrorize a civilian population  radically diminish its local economic capacity both to work and provide for itself  and to force upon it an ever increasing sense of dependency and vulnerability”. (A/HRC/12/48  para. 1893)  The peace process is frozen and there is no hope in sight of jump-starting it soon  as the new Israeli Government is intent on pursuing its business-as-usual policy of more settlements and refusal to engage in a process that addresses the final status issues.  My country is keen to have peace and security soon restored in the northern part of the sisterly nation of Yemen  within the framework of its territorial integrity  sovereignty and unity.  One cannot fail to notice the number of countries that have raised the issue of the representation on and composition of the Security Council. It is undeniable that we are in a different world from that which existed in the aftermath of the Second World War. Given the critical need to have a global body capable of addressing  in some manner  the challenges of an evolving international landscape  the issue is of concern to many countries. For the United Nations to retain its credibility and authority  it must continue to be relevant. New norms have risen  while whole continents lack permanent representation  let alone the power of the veto.  Once again  it must be said that Africa  the continent with the largest number of countries  needs to have a permanent voice in the conduct of world affairs. We see no reason to change our position  which we noted in 2007  that Africa seeks no fewer than two permanent seats  with all the prerogatives and privileges of a permanent member  including the right of the veto  in addition to five non-permanent seats. Of late  things have been changing for the better in much of Africa  but the current disastrous international economic crisis was not of our making  as is true for the fallout from global warming. They and other crises underscore the urgency of our meaningful involvement in the United Nations and in world affairs. Permanent seats and increased membership on the Security Council would be in keeping with those growing international demands.  Time and space do not allow us to consider in any depth a number of other critical issues confronting developing countries. There should be some mention  however  of the harm to countries’ trade and development stemming from the protective tariffs of the industrialized West. The effort to provide subsidies for a few large farming operations  blocking competition from farmers of the developing world  only hurts the latter. Perhaps cotton is a good example.   17 09-53165   There is also the stalemate in the Doha Round trade talks. Those discussions must reopen in earnest  with the commitment to reach a satisfactory conclusion. Lastly  we need to highlight the concern regarding the Millennium Development Goals and the likelihood that they will not be achieved by 2015 in most countries. In sum  that is tragic for so many lives. Efforts must therefore increase towards mitigating that trend.  In conclusion  I wish  on behalf of my Government and the people of Djibouti  to express our heartfelt sorrow and profound condolences to the bereaved families and to the Government and the people of the Philippines for the torrential rains and heavy flooding that caused havoc and unprecedented disruption of lives and destroyed infrastructure. "
"47",1929,"DMA",64,2009,"I begin by joining my colleague Heads of State in congratulating Mr. Ali Treki on his well-deserved election as the President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank His Excellency Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann for his effective stewardship of the sixty-third session and to salute Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his tireless efforts to promote global peace  security and development.  It is an internationally accepted fact that we are in a period characterized by unprecedented crisis. Crises related to basic human needs such as food  water and energy are contributing to great distress and hardship in every region of our world and precipitating an escalation in poverty  which we in the United Nations had committed to halve at the beginning of this decade. These crises have the potential to bring great social and political instability to many regions.   The sheer complexity of these matters and their connectivity with human development make the task of addressing them very daunting. The progress made by the international community in this respect must be noted. However  we must all be mindful that whatever the perceived impact or fallout experienced by the economies of the world  the citizens of the small vulnerable States among us will be the worst hit  and therefore they continue to warrant the special attention of this body.  The United Nations Conference on the World Financial and Economic Crisis and Its Impact on Development  which convened last June in this Hall  brought renewed international attention to the magnitude of this crisis. The outcome document (resolution 63/303  annex) confirmed  and further emphasizes  that the crisis has had a particularly negative effect on developing countries such as Dominica.   The irony is that though severely affected by the crisis  our countries had absolutely no relationship or contribution to its cause. It also threatens the realization of the Millennium Development goals. In the Caribbean it is estimated that the impact of the crisis has created the worst set of economic circumstances since the era of independence of the countries of the region  bringing with it depressed commodity prices  a decline in agricultural export earnings  contraction of tourism revenues  retreating foreign direct investment  decreased access to external financing and declining remittances  among others.  At the regional level the Governments of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) are addressing the impacts of the crisis through the establishment in July of a task force that will allow the member States  along with the heads of our regional financial institutions  to facilitate the mobilization of funds and present a core set of proposals for dealing with this crisis. Our Heads of Government have also agreed to the institution of a programme of collective enhancement of our financial services sector through improved national regulatory and supervisory systems  and also through rationalization and consolidation to ensure safety  soundness and stability in that sector.   We concur with the call for the strengthening of institutional arrangements for international cooperation in tax matters. Furthermore  we endorse the recommendation of the Conference of the CARICOM Heads of State for consistent and non-discriminatory implementation of transparency requirements and international standards for exchange of information.  We believe that in order to adapt to the adverse impact of the financial crisis it is crucial that small island developing States and less developed countries receive the following: one  speedy implementation of the decisions of the Conference; two  assistance to facilitate economic diversification while responding to the crisis and the negative impact of climate change; three  fiscal support in view of already high debt burdens; four  practical assistance from United Nations agencies through a compact framework; and five  stimulus funds to be made available by bilateral and multilateral entities.    09-52463 24   With the onset of the financial crisis  there is now a wrong perception that the food crisis is over. Food insecurity continues unabated around the world  and it is estimated that more than a billion people go to bed hungry every night. This is both unacceptable and unsustainable. The creation of the United Nations system high-level Task Force on Global Food Security was a timely and welcome initiative of the Secretary-General and the Director-General of the Food and Agriculture Organization. Increasing investments in agriculture in the developing nations is critical to addressing the food crisis. We therefore welcome the Group of Eight pledge of $15 billion over the next three years for enhancing food security  but we warn that the desired objective may not be achieved if harmful subsidies in agriculture continue to prevail in the developed countries.  Completion of the Doha Development Agenda negotiations at the World Trade Organization takes on renewed importance as we seek solutions to the global financial crisis. An appropriate trade environment for a sustainable recovery for all is highly desirable. It is in that spirit that we must renew our commitment to re-engage in the Doha negotiations with the declared objective of concluding them in 2010.   The status quo has served only to further marginalize small and vulnerable States and has led to the almost total collapse of some of our major industries  including sugar and bananas  which provided the livelihoods of numerous farming families and communities. Our Governments continue the struggle to develop their economies in the absence of the much-needed foreign exchange that those industries generated. Increasing the competitiveness of developing countries and their effective participation in world trade underscores that Aid for Trade as a new and independent source of development financing must be at the centre of the trade and development agenda.  Climate change has emerged as one of the leading challenges of our generation. If it is not arrested and sufficiently managed  its adverse impact has the potential to undermine human security and the social and economic stability of all nations. All around us we see evidence of escalating climate change in the form of severe weather  floods  drought  devastating hurricanes and cyclones and rising sea levels.   Small island developing States are most vulnerable to the negative impact of climate change. As a consequence  we find our countries in the front line of this monumental challenge to humanity. In Dominica and several of the sister islands of the Caribbean  situated as we are in the hurricane belt  there have been and will continue to be an almost annual cycle of considerable damage to houses  roads  coastlines and other infrastructure. For many of our countries there is a constant struggle to achieve economic development and a higher quality of life for our people  only to find ourselves experiencing these heavy losses and having routinely to start all over again.   As global preparations for the critical Copenhagen conference continue  the urgency to act to address climate change has increased. What has long been pointed out by the scientists has now been confirmed by those whose unsustainable production has precipitated an Earth crisis  which must be addressed if our planet is to survive. The General Assembly  in its resolution 63/281 of 3 June this year  recognized the security implications of climate change as an additional dimension of the crisis. That is clearly evident for many small island States whose viability and very existence are threatened by conditions such as the rising sea levels.  Dominica is at the forefront of nature conservation. Upon attaining political independence in 1978  our country was aptly dubbed the “Nature Island of the Caribbean” in view of our unwavering commitment to the management and conservation of our abundant biodiversity  extensive national parks system  rich forest resources  mountain ranges  fresh water resources and a pure marine environment. At the World Summit on Sustainable Development held in Johannesburg in September 2002  the then Prime Minister of Dominica  the Honourable Pierre Charles  proclaimed our country as the “Nature Island of the World”. Today in the presence of the world gathering in this body  I announce Dominica’s intention to make our country a model for sustainable development. A cordial invitation is extended to the international community to contribute to this noble venture.  Dominica continues to work closely within the framework of small island States to continue to bring our perspective  as climate change front-line States  to the negotiating table. We are contributing to a solution to the effects of climate change by pursuing measures at the national level to promote energy efficiency  reduce the consumption of fossil fuels and develop our   25 09-52463  geothermal potential for national energy needs  as well as for the possible export of clean energy to our neighbours  in the first instance to the French overseas Departments of Guadeloupe and Martinique.   Dominica is already generating 40 per cent of its electricity by hydropower. We are at an advanced stage of geothermal energy development  which by 2015 should enable us to reach the target of 100 per cent electricity generation by renewable energy. We express our gratitude to France and the European Union for their commendable cooperation towards the shift to renewable energy.  Dominica is therefore encouraged by the many expressions of support for a successful outcome of the Copenhagen meeting made by world leaders at the high-level Summit on Climate Change held a few days ago in this Hall. There is an urgent need for a greater demonstration of political will in this regard. I therefore urge every Head of State or Government to seize the moment to reach an agreement that will protect the inhabitants of this planet from one of the most serious challenges ever to confront humanity.  Dominica remains concerned about the current economic situation in our sister island of Haiti. We recognize the important role of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) in ensuring the stability of that country. We commend all troop-contributing States for their engagement in Haiti  and we appreciate the support of the Security Council in extending the mandate of the Mission. Haiti needs considerable development assistance in order to consolidate the stability that MINUSTAH’s presence has fostered and to ensure the success of the peacebuilding process. In this regard  we endorse and applaud the decision of the Secretary-General to appoint former United States President Clinton as Special Envoy for Haiti. We hope that this appointment will advance the cause of rebuilding that country. Dominica  through its actions and also through CARICOM  will continue to do all in its power to advance the quality of life of the Haitian people.  Central to my country’s development thrust is a particular focus on the advancement of our indigenous people. Consistent with this priority of the United Nations  we support the continued and expanded efforts of the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues in the implementation of the measures contained in its recommendations. In this connection  we welcome the recommendations of the eighth session of the Permanent Forum on indigenous women  the economic development and human rights of indigenous peoples  and specific actions in relation to the Arctic region. Dominica has undertaken and continues to undertake important initiatives to improve the social development of our indigenous people.  We come together every year in the general debate in a true spirit of common resolve and partnership. This common resolve and partnership must assume greater meaning this year because the tasks before the international community are enormous and necessitate collective action. However challenging may be the efforts towards their solution  it seems evident that only genuine global cooperation and concerted multilateral action have the possibility of yielding favourable results. But committed multilateral action in the face of these crises has so far proved to be elusive. A greater demonstration of political will should ensure multilateral action in confronting these crises  as it is an absolute necessity for the survival of this planet.  I take this opportunity to recognize all the countries and organizations that have assisted Dominica and the more vulnerable States in our development thrust. Particular reference must be made to those developing countries which  while dealing with their own domestic challenges  have extended a true fraternal hand of friendship. To all  we express our most sincere gratitude. We also reiterate the call of this General Assembly for an end of the United States embargo against the Republic of Cuba and look forward to an early date for its removal.  Finally  as we chart a most progressive development course for our future  we should ensure that it includes the full implementation of the recommendations emanating from the Conference on the World Financial and Economic Crisis and Its Impact on Development. We should also make every effort to leave Copenhagen with a framework for a firm commitment and a sound climate agreement that will protect the inhabitants of this planet  particularly the most vulnerable  from one of the most serious challenges ever to confront humanity."
"48",1973,"DNK",64,2009,"At this moment in time  major economic and environmental challenges are giving rise to increasing global concerns and impacting people all over this planet. To meet those challenges effectively  we need  more than ever  a dynamic and proactive multilateral system. We need the United Nations to provide global answers to global challenges.  In less than three months  we will meet again in Copenhagen to seal the deal on climate change. The effects of climate change are increasingly felt all over the world  not least in developing countries  and the whole world is looking to us for answers. And answers we must provide — new directions for the future  transformational changes in the way we do business and a new paradigm for growth and development. In this respect  I do welcome the leadership of the Secretary-General as demonstrated by his call for a Summit on Climate Change a few days ago and by his concluding remarks on that occasion.  The message is clear: we must act now to avoid potentially disastrous changes in the global climate. The focus in Copenhagen three months from now will be on three deliverables. First  we must agree on a common goal for a significant reduction in global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and we must set clear targets for both medium and longer term. Secondly  we must agree on a pathway towards achieving these targets. And  thirdly  we must set in motion the policies and measures to sustain our efforts on that pathway.  Reducing CO2 emissions is a challenge for industrialized countries  emerging economies and developing countries alike. There is no contradiction between economic growth and ambitious policies to address climate change. Pursuing a green economy is possible  as shown by the example of  among others  my own country. And  in this context  it is also important to keep in mind the security risks emanating from climate change in all parts of the world. I welcome the Secretary-General’s recent report on this issue entitled “Climate change and its possible security implications” (A/64/350)  and look forward to further deliberations on this topic.  The ongoing financial and economic crisis is reversing hard-won progress in developing countries striving to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The international community must assist the poorest of those countries in mitigating the immediate effects of the crisis  while at the same time ensuring that we do not lose sight of the longer-term challenges in relation to the MDGs and the climate change agenda. There is an imminent risk that the economic crisis will lead to the overall stagnation — or even the reduction — of official development assistance. That is a challenge we must counter and overcome  and it is more crucial than ever that all donors speed up delivery on their aid commitments.   31 09-53165   African countries  in particular  are facing significant obstacles in their efforts to achieve the MDGs. As recommended by the Africa Commission and the MDG3 Global Call to Action  both initiated by the Government of Denmark  there is a need to focus strongly on employment for young people  economic empowerment of women and private sector-led economic growth. Renewed focus on those policy areas will also be essential in coping with the economic crisis and its impact on the continent.  As we embark on the final stage towards 2015  the upcoming 2010 MDG Summit gives us an important opportunity to identify means to speed up achievement of the MDGs. Denmark looks forward to this occasion and is ready to engage actively in the process.  In an increasingly globalized and dynamic world  where the problems we face tend to become ever more complex and intertwined  it is important to treasure and uphold the principles and the objectives enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations: to promote and encourage respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all; to establish conditions under which justice and respect for international obligations can be maintained; and to promote social progress and better standards of living.  States must protect their own populations  and States must be accountable to the global community. In that context  I welcome the recent debate held in this Hall on the responsibility to protect  which showed overwhelming support for the concept on the part of Member States. It bodes well for our continued deliberations on that issue.  I should also like to use this opportunity to encourage all United Nations Members that have not yet done so to become States parties to the International Criminal Court. There should be no impunity for the perpetrators of the most serious international crimes.  Among the most serious present dangers to peace and security is the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery. The upcoming Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons is of utmost importance. The meeting of the Security Council on 24 September  headed by President Obama (see S/PV.6191)  provided ample evidence. We welcome the negotiations between the United States and Russia on reductions to follow up on the Treaty on Strategic Offensive Arms  and we welcome President Obama’s commitment to the ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty  both of which will have a positive impact on the NPT Review Conference.  I should like to take the opportunity to call on Iran and the Democratic People’ s Republic of Korea to comply with their obligations to suspend enrichment activities and to start negotiations on transparent civilian nuclear programmes  as set forth in Security Council resolutions.  The election in Afghanistan was far from perfect. We need to engage with the new Government to create the crucial legitimacy between the Afghan Government and the Afghan people. The new Afghan compact to be built is that between the Government and the people  and our role should be to strengthen that compact and hold the Government accountable. In terms of the role of the international community  we need to be better coordinated and more effective in our support for building the capacity of the Afghan Government. In this the United Nations and the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan play a crucial role.  In neighbouring Pakistan  the international community and the Friends of Democratic Pakistan must seize the opportunity to support the democratic Government in fighting poverty and extremism. We must help Pakistan build a stable  democratic and prosperous State. This would be a significant contribution to peace and development in South Asia. I warmly welcome the efforts of the Government to fight terrorism  while  at the same time  it tries to alleviate the hardship experienced by Pakistan’s internally displaced persons (IDPs). It is a positive development that so many IDPs have returned. Now  a full and fast implementation of the Malakand development strategy is important.  The deadlock in the Middle East peace process and the high level of regional tensions demand new international efforts to promote stability and peace in the region. We are encouraged to see the enhanced American engagement in the Middle East  and we urge all in the region and all parties to the Middle East conflict to honour the Road Map commitments  move speedily ahead and  once and for all  settle their differences in accordance with the international agreements and the Arab Peace Initiative. Furthermore  Denmark is in favour of expanding the mandate of the   09-53165 32  Quartet to include a regional dimension. Also  the Syrian and Lebanese peace tracks should feature permanently on the agenda of the Quartet.  Pirates operating in the Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Aden off the coast of Somalia are a security challenge that poses new legal challenges. Denmark has taken the lead in the international community’s work to identify practical and legal solutions so as to ensure the prosecution of suspected pirates. We welcome the increasingly active involvement of the United Nations in that issue.  In that respect  we have to remember that what is taking place on the open sea is closely linked to the situation on the ground in Somalia. Bringing security and stability to the Somalis is of the highest priority  and Denmark supports the efforts of the United Nations and the African Union  and the Djibouti process.  The United Nations itself must be able to change in order to effectively meet and deliver on all those new challenges. It is important to keep up momentum in the intergovernmental negotiations on reform of the Security Council in order to adapt that key body to the world of today. The United Nations peacekeeping commitments continue to play a decisive role in global peace and security  with now more than 100 000 peacekeepers deployed in nearly 20 missions globally. However  the immense growth and the demand for strengthening the capacity to manage and to sustain those peacekeeping operations have revealed shortfalls pertaining to the decision-making processes and the engagements themselves. Denmark  therefore  warmly supports recent initiatives that would enable us to meet the growing demands with a system in place that is more effective  more transparent and more accountable.  Security is a precondition to programme delivery. Some degree of risk cannot be avoided  but the challenge is to mitigate it. Denmark  therefore  supports the continuing overhaul of security assessments and procedures. However  the situation in a country after the end of a conflict is also often extremely volatile. There is a need to ensure quick  effective and efficient support in post-conflict situations and to strengthen peacebuilding efforts. The United Nations is uniquely suited to lead those efforts  and we welcome the strong emphasis on that issue and look forward to the review of the peacebuilding architecture next year.  The work of the United Nations in the area of gender  women’ s rights and development has for too long been fragmented and underfunded. In that light  the recent decision by the General Assembly in resolution 63/311 to create a new gender entity within the United Nations is of great significance. We will support the Secretary-General in every possible way in his efforts to ensure the swift establishment of such an entity. The rapid creation of a new gender entity will represent a milestone in the important work of reforming the United Nations system.  All United Nations entities  funds and programmes and the Secretariat need to act more coherently. On the operational side  we strongly support the “delivering as one” initiative which seeks to base the various parts of the system on a common understanding of needs and priorities and with full country ownership of the joint programme. It is a collective responsibility and an opportunity to comprehensively pursue that agenda. More effective and efficient ways of working system-wide are important; therefore  harmonization of the Organization’ s business practices must be accelerated across the system.  The President returned to the Chair.  Multilateral cooperation is the best means of maintaining international peace and security and of responding to the challenges  risks and opportunities in an interdependent and globalized world. This Organization holds great legitimacy and moral force  and we encourage the United Nations — Member States  the entire organizational system and the Secretariat — to seize the moment and take the lead in addressing the new global challenges. An ambitious and successful outcome to the upcoming fifteenth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Copenhagen in December would be a significant step in that direction."
"49",2018,"DOM",64,2009,"We convey our warmest congratulations to the renowned Libyan diplomat Mr. Ali Treki on his recent election to preside over the General Assembly at this sixty-fourth session  as well as for his call for a dialogue among civilizations  for interreligious understanding  for the promotion for peace and security and for closing the divide between rich and poor.  Exactly one year ago  when we were taking stock of progress made towards meeting the Millennium Development Goals at the midterm point  something unexpected occurred: the collapse of some of the most emblematic investment banks  and with that the worsening of the global financial crisis.   Before this crisis occurred  however  the world  in particular the developing countries  was already affected by the impact of two other crises that had begun simultaneously: the crisis involving oil prices and that involving food prices.  As a result of the first of these crises  that is  the oil crisis  vigorous and intense social protest broke out in various parts of the world. Suddenly  all products became more expensive. Governments were forced to use their currency reserves to pay their oil bills and were forced to allocate subsidies for the sake of maintaining civic peace and democratic governance.   When it comes to the second crisis  the food crisis  the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations established that as a result of the food crisis  the number of people suffering from hunger worldwide rose by 150 million  which meant that for the first time in human history the total figure exceeded the number of 1 billion human beings.   Before these two crises broke out  the World Bank had already indicated that in order to meet the Millennium Development Goals in the remaining seven years — that is  between 2008 and 2015 — $250 billion were still needed  or $50 billion every year. Obviously  with the outbreak of these crises  which gravely affected the economies of developing countries  the resources needed to meet the objectives that had been set to cut by half the level of poverty worldwide would have to be increased significantly above the projected figures established by the World Bank.  As one can see  the situation last year was already bleak at the time of submitting for analysis and evaluation the achievements that had been made and future challenges to meet in order to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. In spite of the dark clouds that were gathering on the global economic horizon  we still felt optimistic; we held the illusion that we might meet our targets. After all  we had made continuous progress towards meeting some of the Goals. But from then on  we witnessed the deluge of the global financial crisis. Since then  the storm has been so intense that it has created a widespread state of anxiety and fear at a global scale the likes of which has not been seen in many decades.   According to the Director-General of the World Health Organization  Dr. Margaret Chan  400 000 more children and tens of thousands of women will die every year as a direct consequence of the global financial crisis. Today  while the meetings of the General Assembly of the most important global organization are being held  25 000 children will die in various parts of the world. That is the equivalent of saying that a child will die every three seconds  or 18 children every minute.   By the time I conclude my statement this afternoon — my 15 minute statement — worldwide 270 children will have died  whose early deaths could have been avoided. Throughout the course of this year  9 million children  which is equivalent to the entire population of my country  the Dominican Republic  will have lost their lives for no reason or justification. This represents a human tragedy of epic proportions  a true catastrophe. It is morally and politically unacceptable. For that reason  it is important to call upon the General Assembly to declare a state of emergency with regard to compliance with the Millennium Development Goals.   When facing the challenges to our efforts to meet the eight goals established in the year 2000 for improving the human dignity and living conditions of millions of people worldwide  it is possible to adopt different attitudes. We might consider that we have failed and that these goals can never be met; that they represent a new utopia and therefore the only path   31 09-52228  remaining is to abandon any effort to meet those goals. Clearly that would be a cowardly and irresponsible attitude — the worst possible decision. It would mean leaving all those in need of human solidarity and compassion out in the cold. A second attitude would be to reconsider the goals and then extend the timetable to fulfil them; that would seem logical and reasonable. However  that reasoning encounters one obstacle — the fact that children  the poor and the women of the world cannot wait.  The only real way to ensure fulfilment of the Millennium Development Goals by the planned 2015 date  is for the General Assembly to work towards promoting true commitment among nations and governmental and non-governmental institutions to urgently assume their task to achieve economic and social development for all people affected by poverty  hunger  disease and illiteracy.  It cannot be argued that the resources available to address this urgent task are insufficient. We have seen in the diligent manner used to address the collapse of the international financial system that — as the saying goes — where there is the will there is a way.  Looking ahead  the first thing to be considered is that with the forecasted end of the global economic recession and the resulting gradual recovery of economic growth  we must ensure that we never again witness such a sudden and abrupt increase in oil and food prices as a result of excessive speculation and the transactions of the futures market. We issue this warning because we have been observing with concern  an increase in milk prices over the past three weeks on the international market that have risen by more than $1 000 per ton without any valid justification.   We must set aside all individual interests  resistance and obstacles that stand in the way of the reform of the global financial system and the stock markets  in order to establish new mechanisms for regulation and supervision that will guarantee that no crisis such as this one will ever occur again.  Because of the lack of compliance to date by the majority of developed countries with their commitments made during the Copenhagen World Summit for Social Development to contribute to the development of the poorest and most vulnerable nations and due to the prevailing situation of the global recession  we draw the attention of the General Assembly to the possibility of finding new sources of financing for the Millennium Development Goals.   In that regard  we suggest the creation of a working group to carry out professional  high-quality research and submit a report containing recommendations and a plan of action geared towards establishing a fine to benefit development on capital deposited in fiscal havens  offshore banks and international financial centres. Placing financial resources in such fiscal havens means that every year we witness tax evasion in a sum equivalent to $250 billion — a figure — according to the World Bank — equal to the total sum of external aid necessary to meet the Millennium Development Goals.   According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)  some $7 trillion is currently deposited in tax havens which do not contribute one single cent towards fiscal income. OXFAM has indicated that more than $50 billion in fiscal income slips through the fingers of developing countries each year as a result of offshore banks and tax havens. The organization Christian Aid has also affirmed bleakly that tax evasion is responsible for the deaths of more than 5 million children between the year 2000 and 2015 — the years we set to meet the Millennium Development Goals.  There are abundant resources in the world and what is happening is that they are unfairly and unequally distributed due  inter alia  to an existing global financial architecture marked by the lack of transparency  secrecy  money-laundering  evasion and fraud. Our only hope of changing the current situation of economic decline and social deterioration and the moral crisis that is shaking up the world lies in adopting brave  wise and timely decisions in this prestigious global forum.  The peoples of the world are waiting for these decisions. They are aware that their right to a dignified  honourable and happy life depends upon that. We cannot let them down. We must act with justice courage  a sense of history and with a vision of the future.  I cannot conclude this statement without touching upon the current prevailing situation in Honduras. The United Nations passed a resolution condemning the coup d’état which took place in this Central American nation in June of this year and called for the return of democratic order. The same attitude was adopted by the    09-52228 32  Organization of American States  the European Union  the African Union and by the League of Arab States. Despite the entire world’s condemnation of that assault on democracy  the de facto Government of Honduras has remained in power  thereby underscoring the weaknesses of the international community to take action.   President José Manuel Zelaya — the sole legitimate President of Honduras  who was scheduled as the sixth speaker to take the floor in the General Assembly this afternoon — has  in a great display of personal courage and daring  preferred to return to his country. It is now to be hoped that we the representatives of the peoples gathered here at this world forum will be able to act with the same dignity  sense of responsibility and level of commitment when it comes to the supremacy of democracy  freedom and justice."
"50",2065,"DZA",64,2009,"Allow me first to express the pleasure of the Algerian delegation in seeing an illustrious son of a neighbouring and brother country presiding over our work. I would like to assure you of Algeria’s sincere and active support in the fulfilment of your mandate. I would also like to pay heartfelt homage to your predecessor  Father d’Escoto  for the skill he has demonstrated  his moral probity and his full commitment to multilateralism  based on the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations.  I would also like to express our gratitude to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his wise and enlightened conduct of the work of the Organization and the initiatives he consistently deploys to reinforce the role of the United Nations and affirm its moral authority.  This year  once again  the global economic crisis is at the heart of the general debate of the session. The world has had time to measure the scope and gravity of this crisis. It is not yet time to take stock  since we know now that this is neither a short-term economic crisis nor the bursting of a bubble such as the capitalist system has seen in the past. The world has realized that the crisis is that of a system governed by the rules of globalization  just as it has had to face the fact that any serious and lasting solution to this crisis will come about through courageous and concerted decisions. Such decisions must be aimed at promoting global economic governance based on standards of responsibility  equity  solidarity and progress: governance that will be aimed at putting an end to financial and commercial practices that are opaque  iniquitous and unfair  and imposed on the rest of the world in the name of free trade and its dubious efficiency.  The lack of coherence and harmony in the approach to the crisis is apparent from  inter alia  the unfair treatment meted out to developing countries. Why should the nations of the southern hemisphere be forced to bear the burden of a crisis they are not responsible for? Multilateral institutions  also undermined by contradictions and a lack of coherence  are unable to overcome impasses in negotiations on vital questions that have a direct impact on our populations.  This is the case  for instance  with the negotiations on a treaty to replace the Kyoto Protocol on climate change. Here is an area where displaying a spirit of compromise and solidarity is clearly in the interest of every country. And yet the positions of developed countries continue to be motivated by narrow national interests while the very survival of mankind is at stake.  It is also the case with the fundamental aims of non-proliferation and disarmament  which remain hostage to political double standards  discriminatory practices and non-compliance with commitments made  particularly on the part of certain nuclear Powers.   41 09-52179  These practices have not spared the multilateral negotiation frameworks  which nonetheless enjoy legitimacy and the expertise necessary to realize progress on the path to reinforcing the goals of disarmament and non-proliferation. It is also the case in the fight against impunity and violations of human rights and international humanitarian law  which raises the issue of exploitation of these noble causes for political ends.  The question of human rights is addressed with a selective approach  which casts suspicion even on initiatives based on a sincere desire to ensure respect for human dignity. This  too  is the case with international cooperation in the struggle against terrorism. The Algerian delegation believes that the importance of the juridical weapon would be enhanced by the adoption of the long-awaited global convention. It is also convinced that constant adaptation of approach is necessary in responding to this major threat.  The African Union has undertaken not to pay ransom to those who take hostages  and we support its appeal to the United Nations to make this a universal policy as rapidly as possible  given the threat that this phenomenon poses to the security of our peoples and the stability of our countries.  We hope that this Organization will be able to realize substantial achievements in the area of reform  whether in revitalizing the General Assembly  reshaping the Security Council or strengthening the role of the Economic and Social Council. Obviously  a revitalized General Assembly  with a strengthened mandate  will be better able to reach consensus on the reform of the Security Council — a Security Council that would reflect the legitimate aspirations of developing countries  and those of Africa in particular  with equitable representation  along with the quest for new working methods more in line with the demands of our times.  Algeria’s commitment to a policy of good neighbourliness is demonstrated in particular through the numerous initiatives and sincere efforts we have deployed in partnership with our neighbours. We are firmly convinced that preservation of peace  promotion of development and respect for people’s rights are a prerequisite for building a peaceful  united and prosperous Arab Maghreb that is stable and fully integrated.   Everyone knows the importance we attach to the right of peoples to self-determination and the effort that we have put into arriving at a just and lasting solution to the conflict in Western Sahara. The United Nations can always count on Algeria’s complete and sincere support in every initiative aimed at settling this dispute in accordance with the responsibilities that the Organization has taken upon itself and in line with the Charter of the United Nations.  We are fully committed to the cause of the Palestinian people  and believe that current developments pose a grave threat to peace and security throughout the Middle East. The region will never regain peace and stability without a just and lasting settlement of the Palestinian problem  which lies at the core of the Arab-Israeli conflict. It is now obvious to all that a satisfactory solution is impossible unless credible and substantial pressure is applied to the Israeli occupying forces with a view to compelling them to put an end to their policies of provocation and aggression against the Palestinian people  to keep their promises and to respond favourably to all Arab peace initiatives.  Algeria participates actively in the efforts of the African countries to put an end to any conflict that hampers their development and to achieve the political and economic integration of the entire continent.  Establishment of the African Union has created a respected and credible partner whose collaboration with the United Nations has made possible visible progress  especially through the significant reduction of hotspots of tension on our continent.   I will end by reiterating our wish that the conduct of our international affairs will be enhanced by the effective and sincere commitment of the international community to the task of renewing and reinforcing the multilateral system."
"51",2112,"ECU",64,2009,"Ecuador hails the choice of Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. We believe his broad experience in the international scene augurs success in the work of this Assembly. Ecuador wishes especially to commend the former President  Father Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann  for his determination in democratizing this Organization and for his unswerving commitment to the poor and the voiceless of this planet.  The central theme of this general debate — strengthening multilateralism — is the very purpose of the United Nations. This Organization is called on to be the expression of horizontal  democratic and respectful relations among the countries of the world  under the strictest observance of the principle of equal sovereignty among States.   However  with its current structure and operations  the Organization has not been able to respond to the great challenges of the twenty-first century. For that reason  it is urgent to strengthen its structural reform. The Security Council must be more representative  democratic and efficient. To achieve that  we call on all Member States to make a commitment to achieve true substantial transformation this year in the Council’s composition and its working methods. Likewise  our country believes that the General Assembly  as the most democratic and universally representative body  must fully assume the role established for it in the United Nations Charter. It is essential to move forward on substantial agreements that can lead us to a real revitalization of the Assembly.  Along the same lines  Ecuador is committed to regional integration processes as mechanisms of coordination  cooperation and solidarity among peoples. We therefore take on with great dedication and enthusiasm the pro tempore presidency of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR)  as an opportunity to contribute to integration through a welcome mechanism to promote democracy and collective welfare in a coordinated and consensual manner.  Latin America and the Caribbean have understood that the best way to face today’s challenges is through effective multilateral action. Our region is undergoing an intense process of integration based on solidarity and cooperation. That process is demonstrated in such vital regional forums as the Rio Group  UNASUR  the Bolivian Alternative for the Americas (ALBA) and the Caribbean Community. Those groups engender the most diverse proposals and initiatives designed to construct common agendas on social  cultural  political and economic matters  in order to build a new development strategy that is more inclusive and less predatory.  Every integration effort requires the recognition of the principles of equality and sovereignty of States. Therefore my country applauds the reversal of the unfair exclusion of our sister Republic of Cuba from the Organization of American States (OAS). We have settled part of Cuba’s debt  but despite repeated calls on the part of this Assembly over the past 17 years  the economic  commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against that brother country remains in place. The blockade is contrary to the great principles of international law  and its continuance is still severely affecting the well-being and dignity of the Cuban people.  Latin America and the whole world have taken a stand with the historic General Assembly pronouncement (resolution 63/301) condemning the coup d’état against the legitimate Government of the Republic of Honduras. The international community has categorically and unanimously rejected this attack against democracy and against all the practices of peaceful coexistence between peoples. We therefore insist on the immediate restitution of President Zelaya  as well as on the protection of his physical person and an immediate end to the repression of the Honduran people. We echo the resolutions of the United Nations  the OAS  the Rio Group  UNASUR  the European Union  ALBA and the many other international organizations that have made decisive statements on this subject.  I would also like to mention the declaration made by the 61 heads of State and Government of South America and Africa who met on Margarita Island  Venezuela  on 26 and 27 September  in which we    09-52604 28  condemned the coup d’état in Honduras. In that document  we also express our support for the Security Council meeting held on 25 September 2009  which highlighted the issue of the security of the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa  where President José Manuel Zelaya has legitimately been taking refuge since 21 September and which has been subject to an unjustifiable military and police barricade.  We call on the international community to act together to adopt strong measures that guarantee the restitution of democratic order in Honduras in order to promote an election process of some kind and recognize the authorities that are elected as a result of such a process.  Today  we are facing a systemic and multidimensional crisis that jeopardizes not only the balance of an economic system but also the very survival of human beings. The food crisis  the energy crisis and the scandalous financial crisis are clear symptoms of the fact that the system does not work and must be re-invented.  One of the most obvious facets of the overall crisis is the economic and financial crisis. Although this crisis originated in the main speculative markets of the rich countries of the North  that is  the casino economy  its effects have been multiplying and expanding in developing countries.   Nevertheless  the current financial crisis is only a symptom of a larger crisis — the crisis of a system that favours the financial and speculative economy over the real economy. It is also the result of an international financial architecture that is unequal  non-inclusive and inefficient and that must be reformed urgently. Ecuador proposes that the crisis does not require merely technocratic reform but a profound change of our economic model.  For that reason  my Government strongly supported the decision of the General Assembly to hold  this past June  the high-level Conference on the World Financial and Economic Crisis and its Impact on Development. At the Conference  Rafael Correa  President of the Republic of Ecuador  became the main voice of the countries of the South advocating for a comprehensive reform of the current world economic order  which jeopardizes the life and the well-being of millions of people around the planet. President Correa also proposed to democratize and redefine the international financial architecture.  At that Conference  important steps were taken in recognizing the fundamental role of the United Nations in the reform of the international financial system and architecture. We welcome the fact that the Conference acknowledged regional and subregional agreements as integral parts of multilateral responses to the current crisis.   I have the honour of announcing one such response in this forum. This past Saturday  26 September  at the South American and African summit that took place on Margarita Island  our countries signed the constitutive act of the Bank of the South  which will start out with a declared capital of $20 billion and a subscribed capital of $7 billion. The Bank will be a multilateral financial entity aimed at supporting human development in South America. This agreement was reached at the summit of South American and African countries. This important event was part of the proposal put forward by my country on the creation of a new international financial architecture based on a series of regional responses.  In addition to this achievement  we must mention initiatives such as the creation of a common Latin American reserve fund  the establishment of a regional system of payments as a prelude to the creation of a regional central bank and the consolidation of a common monetary system that will create an electronic currency to facilitate our trade. The good news is that we have begun to take fundamental steps in the establishment of the Centralized Payment Compensation System  called SUCRE  which will soon enter into force within ALBA.  We reiterate our reservations concerning the actions undertaken by international credit institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank  since they have collaborated actively to take strong economic and political measures against certain nations. We also reject  on the basis of the principle of sovereignty  the relationship between the World Bank and arbitration centres such as the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes  which has only served to pass judgment on and penalize certain parties and to benefit transnational interests over national interests.  For our countries  the restructuring and relief of our external debt is more urgent than ever. We cannot continue to give higher priority to paying off external debt than to financing a recovery in production and development.   29 09-52604   We have an enormous task ahead of us with respect to the effects of the crisis. The General Assembly working group on the financial crisis will be the ideal mechanism through which to follow up on the implementation of the commitments and tasks that arose out of the Conference last June.  This crisis has shown that capitalism as a model for economic and social relations is not viable. It has also highlighted the imbalances in the relationships between society  nature and the economy. One of the most obvious examples of this is the imbalances that are to be found in the way that the issue of climate change is dealt with.  This past week  a high-level Summit on Climate Change was held in this very Hall. I must frankly state that it was a great disappointment. Empty rhetoric abounded  and no commitments were undertaken  with few exceptions. As a result  our response to the issue has been nothing more than inadequate and  at times  irresponsible. Even worse  we heard repeatedly last week that the major challenge is how to maintain economic growth without affecting the environment — that is  how to preserve the current system  with a few cosmetic adjustments. We believe  however  that we need to completely transform the means of production and consumption and not simply promote further growth without stopping to take stock of where we are.  The principle of shared but differentiated responsibilities  as contained in the Framework Convention on Climate Change  recognizes that rich nations and the elites who consume too much are the major causes of this scourge and that they must therefore assume a large proportion of the costs of reducing emissions. Wealthy countries must make additional efforts to decrease their greenhouse gas emissions  beyond the reductions already brought about by the economic crisis.   Reducing emissions is urgent but not sufficient. Adaptation measures must be identified  in particular in vulnerable countries and countries that lack the economic resources to deal with the impacts of climate change. We are not speaking about donations or credit being offered for adaptation efforts. Reparations must be made that recognize the ecological debt and take into account the historic responsibility for the excessive emissions of the past several decades  when the greenhouse effect was already recognized. Serious studies on the subject estimate that this would amount to at least $50 billion dollars a year over 20 or 30 years.  We demand that the countries of the North comply with and strengthen the commitments they undertook in the context of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and Kyoto Protocol regarding measures for adaptation and mitigation  the development and transfer of technologies and their financing. However  we recognize that we have a shared responsibility to provide responses to the climate crisis. For this reason  Ecuador has offered significant proof of its commitment to this issue. I would like to briefly mention four initiatives that my country has undertaken.  The first initiative  and the one that provides the guidelines and foundation for Ecuador’s international environmental policy  is the Yasuni Ishpingo-Tambococha-Tiputini (Yasuni ITT) initiative  an innovative project that was introduced by President Rafael Correa at the 2007 United Nations Climate Change Conference and that breaks with traditional discredited approaches. Ecuador has decided to keep a considerable amount of its proven oil reserves underground — about 850 million barrels of crude — in order to pursue three important goals. The first goal is to prevent the pollution that would result from the emission of 410 million tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The second is to protect the indigenous peoples who live in the Yasuni National Park  the Taromenane and Tagaeri peoples. The third goal is to preserve biodiversity. In that connection  an international trust fund will be established in the coming weeks as a financial mechanism to enable us to receive international contributions and invest them in conservation and sustainable development initiatives for the country  in line with the development goals laid out in our national development plan.  The second initiative is the Forest Partners Programme  which is an initiative that provides economic incentives to indigenous peoples and rural farmers to protect our forest. This will enable us to protect 20 per cent of our total forest areas until the year 2015.  The third initiative is a programme to transform the energy grid  aimed at ensuring that the main sources of energy used in the country are renewable and sustainable. One of the projects undertaken under    09-52604 30  this programme is being carried out in the Galapagos Islands  a world heritage site for humankind  with the goal of achieving 100 per cent clean energy sources on the archipelago by 2015.  Our fourth initiative would take place in the context of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and proposes the introduction of an eco-tax of approximately 3 per cent on oil prices  in order to bring about a decrease in demand and thereby a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions. This proposal was first put forward by Herman Daly  an environmental economist  and subsequently taken up and presented to OPEC by President Rafael Correa. The revenue from the proposed eco-tax would facilitate  under the administration of a body such as the United Nations  projects to facilitate the conversion of the energy grid to using renewable energy.  Ecuador believes that this time of crisis represents an opportunity to make radical changes that will allow us to transform our societies from their current model  which is based on competition and on irrational and unsustainable habits of consumption that prioritize merchandise over people  into societies based on human beings living in harmony with themselves  with their fellow human beings and with nature.  For us  land  nature and the physical environment are essential components of the fundamental principle of our constitutional ordering of well-being  or “sumak kawsay”. This principle of well-being implies living with dignity according to our cultural values and in harmony with nature and is the basis for the economical and social policies that my Government is embracing in order to overcome social inequalities.  We would also like to highlight  once again  the gravity of the food crisis. In an era where the technology to produce sufficient food exists  there is hunger in the world. This is due to the fact that access to food is dominated by the large transnational agricultural companies that control the global market. In addition  subsidies and other distortions on trade have a serious impact on agriculture in countries of the South.  We firmly support the convening of the World Summit on Food Security  which will take place in Rome during the sixty-fourth session of the General Assembly and is aimed at reaching agreements on assigning priority to the right to food security and sovereignty over the pursuit of profit and the drive to maximize gains.  In order to achieve the targets defined by the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) as the minimum required for survival and well-being  those Goals must be complemented by decisive support from the countries of the North aimed at increasing official development assistance and international cooperation without imposing any kind of conditions.  Review of the progress made in achieving the MDGs will take place in the year 2010  as mandated by the Assembly  and must serve to lay the foundation for efforts to correct the errors and omissions of these Goals. They include  in particular  the failure to consider the structural causes of the problems  the lack of attention paid to human rights  the absence of any goal dealing with the generation of valuable employment  the exclusion of our ancestral peoples from the process of drawing up public policies and the absence of a multicultural approach in defining the Goals.   At this session  the General Assembly will be taking important strategic decisions regarding Ecuador. We are sure that all Member States will strive to make the Organization’s efforts more effective in the promotion and defence of the rights of differently abled persons  the recognition and implementation of the rights of indigenous peoples  gender equality  and efforts to combat human trafficking  among other important issues.  I would like to refer in particular here to my country’s commitment to combating the scourge of illegal human trafficking. We firmly support the need for a global plan of action  and we offer to the Organization our national experience in terms of legal and control issues.  Another subject we consider essential for the agenda of this Assembly is that of international migration. In the current Ecuadorian Constitution  one of our most transformative principles is based on the recognition of universal citizenship. We do not impose any restrictions on the freedom of movement of people around the world. We believe we are all citizens of the world. There is no such thing as illegal human beings. There are  however  such things as illegal and immoral practices of exclusion and exploitation. In this twenty-first century  merchandise and capital are not bound by any borders  but walls are being built to restrict the   31 09-52604  movement of human beings. Ecuador will continue to work towards a constructive multilateral dialogue on migration and the adoption of a comprehensive approach on the issue of the human rights of migrants and their families  in accordance with the mandate set by the heads of State in the 2005 World Summit Outcome.  As a country that prioritizes respect for and the guarantee of all human rights  Ecuador currently receives more refugees than any other country in the Western Hemisphere. Without belittling the support that we receive from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees  we must stress that we have allocated significant economic resources to assist people who are in need of international protection. We have implemented pioneering measures and policies with respect to the protection of refugees. We have one of the most advanced programmes in terms of refugee management  namely  the Expanded Registration programme.  Ecuador  as a founding member of the United Nations  accords priority to dialogue and international cooperation in the resolution of conflicts and believes that military action alone cannot bring about lasting and sustainable peace in any conflict zone in the world.   The commitment of Ecuador to the stabilization process in the brotherly Republic of Haiti is internationally recognized. Because of this  since the beginning of the Haitian crisis in February of 2004  we have actively participated in the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti  in terms of a mostly civil contingent. This endeavour was undertaken in accordance with our foreign policy of complete support for and attention to humanitarian crises and the peaceful resolution of conflicts.   I cannot conclude this statement without mentioning Ecuador’s satisfaction at having renounced  a few days ago  any solution that is not in accordance with international law. We hope to achieve very shortly a normalization of diplomatic relations with the brotherly Republic of Colombia  which will be of great benefit for both of our peoples. This was made possible thanks to the opportunity for dialogue and meetings offered by the General Assembly each year.  Finally  I extend once again the affectionate and hope-filled greetings of the Ecuadorian people  the revolutionary citizenry of my country  and my President  Rafael Correa  to the rest of the world’s people and to their representatives here."
"52",2157,"EGY",64,2009,"Mr. President  on behalf of the African continent  allow me at the outset to congratulate our sisterly country  Libya  and you personally  on your assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly  and to express our confidence that your leadership will lead to achieving the success to which we aspire. I would also like to reaffirm the full support of Egypt and the Non-Aligned Movement for you in the fulfilment of your mission.  Our session this year convenes against the backdrop of international crises unprecedented in their nature and scope. The list of global challenges we are facing  such as climate change  the food crisis and the crises in international peace  is supplemented by additional emerging global challenges that make it essential for us to redouble our efforts in a coordinated and collective manner.   The global financial crisis  together with the spread of diseases  such as the H1N1 virus  threatens public health worldwide. Meeting this challenge requires a high degree of conscientious collective work and a shared awareness of the effect that such a crisis could have in many of our countries on stability in the economic  social  even political  and perhaps security spheres.  With regard to collective work on the international level  we should not overlook the fact that the current international structures designed to manage the realities of the global economy must reflect a balance between the present and future. Therefore  those structures must be subject to change  so as to become more compatible with current reality.   The change I refer to here is a gradual and strategic shift  one which would make membership in   41 09-52586  such structures accessible to a larger number of developing countries and would grant them a stronger and more effective voice in determining the course of the world economic order and its future.  A few days ago  we all took part in the climate change summit  convened upon the initiative of the Secretary-General  and listened to all the pledges made and the concerns expressed. While Egypt is aware of the seriousness of the phenomenon in question and the gravity of the challenges that climate change is imposing on all of us  we believe in the possibility that collective work could provide new opportunities for advancing development in developing societies in a manner that would allow the agreed sustainable development principles to be fulfilled. In this respect  we look forward  as was stated by President Mubarak at the L’Aquila summit in Italy in July 2009  to arriving at a fair and balanced deal at the upcoming Copenhagen conference in December that would take into consideration the aspirations and rights of developing countries and  at the same time  address all crucial issues  including mitigation  adaptation  financing and technology transfer.   A fair and balanced deal should further ensure the fulfilment of commitments by developed countries  and enable our developing countries to implement their voluntary commitments within the framework of honest application of the principle of common but differentiated responsibility.  The world financial crisis did not originate in  nor was it caused by  developing countries. However  they are all suffering from its consequences in different forms and at different levels as a result of the decrease in the volume of international trade  the tightening of international credit terms and the decline in tourist inflows and monetary remittances.   The current international economic recession has no doubt negatively affected most States. However  States of the South remain the most affected  due to the negative repercussions of the recession on public spending in health care  education and sustainable development in general. The parallel economic  financial and food crises that we are still confronting undoubtedly compound the hardships faced by the countries of the South in particular  and place enormous burdens on us in terms of preserving economic and social security in our countries.   To confront such challenges  serious and genuine international support and solidarity are required  based on enhancing agricultural development with a view to increasing production and productivity. Furthermore  there is an urgent need to launch an international dialogue between exporting and importing countries in the developing and developed worlds alike  in order to agree on an international strategy to confront the crisis  and to formulate an international code of conduct to review the policies that govern the use of biofuels. In addition  we must reach an agreement under the umbrella of the World Trade Organization that eliminates agricultural subsidy programmes that are in operation in some developed countries.  To confront the energy crisis  it is important to have a genuine  broad dialogue among the relevant parties to identify the best available options. The situation requires securing increased development assistance and further investments in the markets of energy-producing developing countries  as well as confronting irresponsible speculation on international markets.  In this context  Egypt hopes that the 2010 high-level meeting to follow up on the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) will expedite renewal of international commitment and solidarity towards achieving the Goals. A comprehensive assessment of what has been achieved thus far in the implementation of the MDGs must be carried out and a mechanism established to follow up on implementation. This should lead to full implementation by 2015  particularly in Africa  which is witnessing low implementation rates  an issue which needs to be effectively addressed.  Undoubtedly  all of these challenges oblige the countries of the South to strengthen mutual cooperation. As current Chair of the Non-Aligned Movement  Egypt will work to enhance South-South cooperation in coordination with the Group of 77 and China. We look forward to a successful United Nations conference on South-South cooperation  to be held in Kenya later this year  aimed at further strengthening this cooperation.  Having spoken of the interlinked crises facing the world today  I would like to address an important issue related to the human rights architecture of the United Nations system. Despite the radical reform ushered in by the establishment of the Human Rights Council     09-52586 42  Egypt is still dissatisfied with respect to the politicization of human rights issues. This politicization weakens the potential to reach consensus on a variety of issues that should not be subject to differences as they are of concern to us all and affect the credibility of the work of the United Nations in this vital field. Hence  Egypt is determined to exert its utmost effort to engage with other States in order to bring divergent views closer together and to establish common ground to restore the international consensus that binds us all  which forms the basis for our actions in this important area in the Human Rights Council and in the General Assembly.  In that context  we look forward to a greater role for the Human Rights Council. Every one of us should address the issue of the incitement of religious hatred and racism under the pretext of freedom of expression. We look forward to  and in fact have already begun to seek  commonly agreed language for a draft resolution on freedom of expression  to underscore the importance of this freedom as an indispensable cornerstone of any democratic society  while avoiding the depiction of acts of incitement to religious  racial and other forms of hatred as legitimate acts of freedom of expression. We categorically reject such a depiction.  Turning to issues of international peace and security  I will begin with disarmament. Egypt attaches great importance to a successful conclusion of the 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)  in the hope that nuclear disarmament and the nuclear non-proliferation regime will be put back on the right track. This will depend on dealing effectively with the decisions and the resolutions of the 1995 and 2000 Review Conferences  in particular the resolution on the Middle East.   It is crucial that the international community as a whole support the current active momentum in the international arena with regard to disarmament issues  especially in the light of developments in the positions of the main nuclear-weapon States  in particular the United States. We have listened to their statements  in particular the address by President Obama to the Assembly on 23 September (see )  and we hope that these evolving positions will provide an opportunity for making historic progress in this regard.  In the same context  it is necessary to effectively deal with the issues of regional stability and security  mainly through eliminating the incomprehensible and unjustified lassitude in dealing with the issue of Israeli nuclear capabilities and the persistent threat they pose to security and stability in the Middle East. This is especially true in the context of intensified efforts to expand the commitments of the non-nuclear States parties to the NPT  without due regard for the need to achieve the Treaty’s universality — and if there is no commitment  there should be no universality — and to subject all nuclear facilities in the Middle East to the comprehensive safeguards regime of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Egypt will continue its diligent work to address this situation in all relevant international forums and to highlight the risks  with the aim of effecting changes in the situation.  The situation in the Middle East region is still dominated by considerable tension  a tendency towards confrontation and lack of stability. Notwithstanding the tireless efforts exerted to stabilize the situation  many parties still consider it beneficial to exacerbate that tension.  The question of Palestine clearly remains far from being resolved  despite international concern and all the serious efforts  pressure  contacts  visits and meetings. Since I questioned in this Assembly last year (see A/63/PV.13) the existence of genuine Israeli determination to achieve a just peace with the Palestinians  events have thus far justified our scepticism.   Throughout this year  Israel has shown a lack of the political will necessary to engage in serious and credible negotiations that aim at reaching a final settlement to the conflict  a settlement which encompasses all the elements  tracks and topics and which leads to the establishment of an independent Palestinian State on the complete Palestinian national territory  occupied since 1967  with East Jerusalem as its capital.  In this respect  I would like to sum up the Egyptian view of the situation with the following elements  including what we hope to achieve.   First  intensive work during the coming period is necessary in order to resume the negotiating process as soon as possible. The international community should put forward a formula for a final settlement to the conflict — the so-called end game — cognizant of the need to waste no more time in studying details that   43 09-52586  everyone knows will not help to realize the desired settlement.  Secondly  Israel’s commitment to completely freeze settlement activity in all occupied Palestinian territories  including East Jerusalem  must be secured  not only because such activity is contrary to international law and should be halted  but also in order to build a climate of trust between the two parties  thus allowing final-status negotiations to bear fruit. Such Israeli commitment would pave the way to restoring lost credibility in efforts to achieve peace. On the other hand  any retreat from that commitment would inflict severe harm on the prospects for peace in the coming period.  Thirdly  the freeze of Israeli settlement activity should occur simultaneously and in parallel with the negotiations  in order to bolster Palestinian trust in Israeli intentions.   Fourthly  if an agreement is reached on the final borders of the State to be established on the Palestinian national soil occupied in 1967  on the understanding that the State’s borders are essentially those of 1967  as had been agreed by both parties during the 2008 negotiations with the participation of the United States  that agreement could be gradually implemented at a pace to be agreed upon by both parties and within a time-bound framework.   Fifthly  East Jerusalem is an integral part of the occupied Palestinian territories. As one of the issues to be included in final status negotiations  it should under no circumstances be excluded from any future negotiations.  Sixthly  Israel’s engagement in a serious  credible  clear and time-bound negotiating process would restore the situation on other issues to that which prevailed in the 1990s in terms of Arab interaction with Israel  with a view to enhancing mutual trust and thus boosting negotiating efforts as a whole.  Egypt is closely following the situation in sisterly Sudan with the same high level of interest  not only because of the historical bonds between our two peoples and nations but also out of concern for the Sudan’s future  stability and territorial integrity and our awareness of the numerous threats facing it. Egypt is working earnestly with all Sudanese parties  foremost among which is the Sudanese Government  and in coordination with influential regional and international stakeholders to resolve existing problems. Our sons take part in the United Nations forces in South Sudan and in Darfur  and we contribute — out of our limited resources — to efforts to support development and provide health care to our brothers and sisters in the south and west of the Sudan. We hope that the Sudanese people  in their wisdom and with the support they receive from their neighbours and international partners  will be able to weather the upcoming critical phase  so that the Sudan’s unity can withstand all future tests and so that unity becomes the first and the most attractive option for all Sudanese. This is an important objective  which Egypt is working diligently to achieve.  We cannot conclude our comments on the Middle East without referring to security in the Arab Gulf region  which is among Egypt’s main interests and at the top of its foreign policy priorities. This focus is not only based on the strong bonds that connect us with the member States of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)  but also on our firm conviction that Egypt represents a strategic asset for its Arab brothers in the Gulf area. For this reason  Egypt will work with GCC countries to ensure Arab regional security and that any security arrangements that are being contemplated by international or regional parties will correspond fully to the needs and concerns of the Arab Gulf States.  In conclusion  the fifteenth Summit Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held in Sharm el-Sheikh  Egypt  on 15 and 16 July 2009  adopted four main declarations. The first is the Sharm el-Sheikh Declaration  which contains our member States’ clear vision on the most critical current issues that constitute a priority for our work within the United Nations. These include in particular the issues of disarmament and international security  peacekeeping and peacebuilding  human rights and democracy  the right of peoples to self-determination  the situation in the Middle East and the Palestinian question  the reform of the United Nations  unilateral sanctions  the global financial and economic crisis  internationally agreed development goals  food security  Africa’s special needs  diseases and pandemics  the role of civil society  climate change  energy  human trafficking  international terrorism and dialogue among civilizations and religions. The second declaration is on the necessity of ending the economic  commercial and financial embargo imposed by the    09-52586 44  United States of America against Cuba. The third is on designating 18 July as International Nelson Mandela Day. The fourth is a declaration on Palestine. These declarations will be issued as official documents of the United Nations.  Last July  following the chairmanship of the friendly country of Cuba  Egypt assumed leadership of the Non-Aligned Movement for the next three years. We are determined to implement the provisions of the Summit’s final document according to the priorities set out in those declarations. We shall put forward at this session the pertinent draft resolutions and decisions to implement those documents. The delegation of Egypt will be pleased to work with all Member States in a spirit of openness and determination to make this session a success. We extend a hand to all States with an open mind and the resolve to achieve success on the international agenda before us."
"53",2181,"ERI",64,2009,"Let me begin by congratulating our sisterly country the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and you personally  Mr. President  on your assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. I express our confidence that your long-standing diplomatic skills and leadership will lead us to a successful conclusion of the session. I wish to assure you of the full support of the delegation of the State of Eritrea in the realization of this mission.  Permit me also to seize this opportunity to pay a well-deserved tribute to the President of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session  Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann of Nicaragua  for the very able and effective manner in which he led the affairs of the Assembly.  Likewise  we commend Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his continuous efforts to administer the affairs of the United Nations  and especially for convening the Summit on Climate Change last week.  The General Assembly is holding its annual general debate for 2009 at a very critical juncture. One year after the world financial and economic crisis began  this gathering provides us with another opportunity for reflection.  The Hall in which we meet today and the lofty purposes for which it was built have both outlived their time. This body was conceived in another era to address the challenges of the world order prevailing after the First and Second World Wars. Therefore  it cannot realistically cope with the demands of the twenty-first century. From an objective point of view  the United Nations should have embarked on a process of transformation 20 years ago  in concurrence with the end of the cold war. By now  it should have been replaced by a reformed Organization fit to address the challenges of the century we live in and beyond.  The calls to re-engineer this renewed Organization have not been few. Two decades have passed without any meaningful results in the direction   23 09-52598  of substantive reform. The financial and economic crisis and the global awareness that it has spawned are mere symptoms of the consequences of inaction at the cost of reform.  The prevailing world order has not succeeded in guaranteeing the peace and security of our planet  in spite of all the intentions that brought forth its creation and of the harsh lessons learned from the two World Wars. On the contrary  this ageing world order has been hijacked to serve the interests of the few  opening the door to a myriad of ramifications.   Financial institutions have been left to operate unrestrained by restrictions or regulations. Economic structures that pillage the resources and wealth of peoples and nations have been consolidated. Illegitimate military and coercive blunders have been allowed to fester unchecked. The exploitation of war and those who help spread it have been honed in a purposeful manner. The number of people suffering from poverty and hunger has not been reduced; it has rather multiplied many times over. Violent extremism has not received the attention it deserves; rather  it has been further fuelled and manipulated as a pretext and excuse for ulterior motives. A culture of the politics of fear and management by crisis has been nurtured  exploited and established as a norm. Indeed  world peace and security have been imperilled beyond measure. The United Nations itself has been one of the victims of this world order. Evidence to this effect is known to us all and is well documented.  Reform and change are long overdue. Despite fervent calls for reform by the international community  the few who control our outdated world order are unfortunately not attuned to the notion of change. They have instead regarded crises and suffering as ordinary historical imperatives. To this end  they have resisted all attempts to introduce change and  through their clout  influence and advantages  have been able to block it. Thus  no real reform has occurred so far.  In this global maelstrom  where even the peoples of the developed countries have been adversely affected  none have been more exposed to harm than the marginalized in Africa. We  the peoples of Africa  have been victims of poverty and hunger  models of backwardness  and metaphors for diseases and epidemics. And the continent has become a breeding ground for crises and conflicts.   In this regard  the most urgent concern is the fact that special-interest groups have rendered Africans paralysed. Hence  instead of resolving our own problems  we find ourselves mired in poverty  hunger and disease rather than actively striving to achieve development and growth. Similarly  when it comes to the resolution of crises and conflicts  Africans find themselves dependent on the goodwill of others.   However  criticism cannot be reserved only for the special-interest groups that steer the prevailing world order; it must also be apportioned to those groups that serve as their instruments and partners. Indeed  the role of Africa in this body  as well as in other international organizations  can best be described as inconsequential. The evidence for this unfortunate situation is also well documented.  If world peace and security are to be preserved  justice and human rights respected  hunger eradicated  and economic development and growth made to benefit the majority in a sustainable fashion  the implementation of fundamental change in this Organization and other international bodies should not be left to the goodwill of the few. The change needed to transform this outdated world order into a new one must not be limited to reform; it should be solid  genuine and capable of bringing peace  security and prosperity to coming generations. Reform should not be limited to increasing the number of seats in the Security Council. It should  rather  steer our world away from its dangerous downhill path  controlled by a powerful few  and redirect it towards one that ensures the safety of all.  Though this is the ideal to which the world’s peoples aspire and strive for  the African continent  for obvious and particular reasons  needs to expend more effort to achieve it. But beyond all the good wishes  the fundamental reform we are waiting for requires collective commitment. On this auspicious occasion  it would not do simply to dwell on various current events or those consequences spawned by the fundamental flaws of the world order. Doing so would only confuse and distort the bigger picture. I have therefore chosen not to address important issues concerning the Horn of Africa and Eritrea’s specific problem of the illegal occupation of sovereign Eritrean territory  which is already in the records of the United Nations awaiting responsible and urgent action."
"54",2227,"ESP",64,2009,"A little more than a year ago  we witnessed with great concern the collapse of some of the largest financial institutions of the world’s wealthiest countries. That financial fissure precipitated a global economic crisis which  despite the emerging signs of recovery  all of us continue to experience. We faced the stark reality that we lacked the necessary guidelines and rules to prevent what was occurring in the global financial system  even though it already was a global system. Now  following the G-20 summits in Washington and London  where we laid the foundations to resolve the problems  it is up to the Pittsburgh conference to finish the work.   Despite what has been said  this is not the first globalization crisis. Instead  it is the first crisis of global governance  that is to say  a crisis of an insufficiently governed globalization. We have an obligation to learn from this experience — certainly to learn a lesson with regard to the financial and economic crisis  but also about the other global challenges that require both collective determination and coordinated multilateral political efforts. For those challenges are interrelated. We cannot aspire to economic and social development unless countries and peoples enjoy adequate peace and security. Conversely  it will not be possible to build lasting peace and security unless there is sustainable development.   That same willingness to take responsibility for both problems and solutions  which has re-emerged strongly in recent months  should ensure that we do not fail in responding to the conflicts and threats confronting world peace and security. That willingness should also ensure that we do not fail in dealing with extreme hunger and poverty; in effectively committing ourselves to combating the effects of climate change; or in tackling organized crime  terrorism and piracy. We therefore have a great opportunity before us.   Here at the general debate  one year after the beginning of the financial crisis that nearly engulfed the well-being of developed countries and dashed the hopes of many others  I would like to reiterate that Spain is a country committed to multilateralism and the need to continue to develop a system of global governance — and that applies to every one of the challenges to which I have just referred. But before turning to those challenges  I should like to begin by saying that multilateralism is not just a process for taking decisions and resolving conflicts at the international level. It is indeed that; but in order for multilateralism to be effective and lasting  it must above all include two fundamental elements.  First of all  multilateralism is intrinsically linked with the faithful observance of democratic values  human rights and effective equality between women and men throughout the world. In that regard  I very much welcome the last resolution adopted by the General Assembly at the previous session  which will make a single body responsible for all gender issues.   Today  however  standing firmly for democracy elicits a single name: Honduras. Our Latin American brothers in that country have in recent years seen the strengthening of both democracy and the prospects for the future. With the support of Spain and the international community  they have now decided that they are going to overcome the challenge before Honduras. We will not accept an anti-democratic coup. We will not accept it  and democracy must return to Honduras.   09-52320 26   Secondly  but no less important  multilateralism requires  if not a culture  an atmosphere of dialogue  respect and acceptance between countries  regions and  more broadly  civilizations. Five years ago  I addressed the General Assembly for the first time to propose the establishment of an alliance of civilizations focused on promoting understanding and cooperation between countries and peoples of different cultures and religions  as well as on countering the forces that breed extremism and endanger peace.   We cannot be satisfied solely at the fact that the group of friends for that initiative has since grown to over 100 members  or that there are now associated networks of individuals and representatives of civil society organizations who are ensuring the continued existence of the project  or that the third forum of the Alliance will be held next year in Rio de Janeiro. Nor can we be satisfied at the fact that those developments clearly illustrate the universality of the principles underpinning the initiative. Respect for the diversity of civilizations  cultures and traditions are crucial to the effectiveness and sustainability of the multilateralism that we wish to see strengthened on the basis of human rights and the universal values that we share as responsible members of the international community.  When I launched the Alliance of Civilizations initiative from this very rostrum five years ago  it was at a less favourable time than the present. Yesterday  having heard statements by the President of the United States of America and other international leaders  I thought to myself that this effort has been worthwhile. Today the Alliance is able to deploy its full potential in order to promote the effective multilateralism we desire. We are now able to build. The initiative was worth it and — if I may put it this way — it was also right that the United Nations made it its own through Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and his predecessor  Kofi Annan.   Spain is therefore pleased that the President of the General Assembly has proposed that the debate at this new session focus on “Effective responses to global crises: strengthening multilateralism and dialogue among civilizations for international peace  security and development”. We must now take a new step.   The Alliance of Civilizations  which sets out and promotes those values throughout the entire United Nations  should be a structural component of the main bodies and all other entities of the Organization. The time has come for the General Assembly to adopt a resolution conferring that structural character on the Alliance of Civilizations through a constitutive charter. Spain will work with Turkey and the wider membership of the Alliance’s group of friends in order that such a resolution can be adopted by the end of this fall. I am convinced that it will make a very positive contribution to the work of such bodies as the Human Rights Council  the Economic and Social Council and even the Security Council. The dialogue among civilizations should be the mother tongue of the United Nations.  The new multilateralism has been essential for taking significant steps forward in the area of disarmament and arms control  such as prohibiting anti-personnel landmines and cluster bombs.   Now  the world has the opportunity to take a great step: abolishing nuclear weapons. President Obama has had the courage to put that on the table  and the United States and Russia — a country that is and will remain key to Euro-Atlantic security — are negotiating the largest cuts ever made to these arsenals. We encourage them. We are hopeful about the initiative to convene a special summit of the Security Council devoted to the fight against nuclear proliferation.   Spain  a nation that renounced the development and possession of nuclear weapons  fully shares that objective and will support it with every means at our disposal. We should immediately undertake to strengthen the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)  whose Review Conference in May 2010 will coincide with Spain’s presidency of the European Union. I pledge to do everything possible  as far as Spain and the European Union are concerned  to ensure that this important conference has concrete results that will enable us to advance the perspective of a world free from nuclear weapons.   Let us continue to act with determination and without discouragement to build and consolidate peace in all areas and regions. My country is proud to have been contributing to United Nations peacekeeping missions for 20 years. Over those 20 years  we have taken part in 22 missions comprising a total of more than 100 000 troops.   Currently  we share the concern over the situation in Afghanistan. I am sure  however  that the international community will be able to find a   27 09-52320  solution — a solution that is not and cannot be purely military. The shared conviction as to the strategic value of the region and the internal solidarity among the countries present there is stronger than ever and will be decisive in the face of the difficulties before us.   I also wish to reiterate the need to persevere in seeking formulas for peace in the Middle East because of that conflict’s potential to spread and affect other regional conflicts such as those just mentioned. The world has an unresolved task: peace in the Middle East  with two secure States — the State of Israel  but also the State of Palestine  which the international community must consider and recognize within a reasonable period of time. Peace in the Middle East has been and continues to be the first strategic priority for the international community.   According to the most recent estimates  more than 1 billion people throughout the world — nearly one sixth of its total population — suffer hunger. We must say this as often as possible: figures such as that  reflecting unfathomable human suffering  assault our consciences time and again as leaders of the international community and as citizens. It is unjust and unacceptable to proceed further into the twenty-first century  as we are doing  with such a radical imbalance in the living conditions of humanity. It is unjust  unacceptable and also unsafe — a permanent source of instability. It is not possible to aspire to a secure world if the current levels of inequality and poverty persist.   That is why our commitment to international peace and security must go hand in hand with a renewed effort to eradicate poverty  using our leadership responsibly and with solidarity and avoiding the temptation  in times of economic crisis  to lessen our commitment to the world’s poorest and most vulnerable.   The achievement of the Millennium Development Goals must be a central aspect of the international agenda. Five years before 2015  the Goals can still be achieved  with sustained collective effort. At the next session of the General Assembly  we must reach specific agreements that will guarantee their achievement.    I wish to strengthen the appeal for that urgent joint effort by citing the commitment of my country and its citizens. I refer in particular to Africa. The twenty-first century should belong to a continent that has been dispossessed for too long in the history of humanity: the African continent. Spain has become the seventh-largest international donor and the eighth-largest United Nations contributor  and we have made a clear commitment in the area of food security.  Over the past few years  we have raised humanity’s awareness about the seriousness of the effects of climate change. There is now sufficient awareness about the need to combat climate change and also about the opportunities it provides us to create a new model of economic development — sustainable development.   With climate change  the time for awareness-raising is over and the time for commitments has arrived. We do not need any more words; it is time for action. We must take everyone’s circumstances into account  but  if we are to make collective progress  we must not delay. Although we have been able to see the effects of the economic crisis  we still find it difficult to react to the effects of a phenomenon much more devastating for entire future generations. That is paradoxical and incomprehensible — even more so when we consider that to emerge from the economic crisis means ensuring the only kind of growth possible: sustainable growth.   We have 75 days before the Copenhagen summit begins. They can be 75 days for the future or for failure  75 days for responsibility or for impotence  75 days for agreement or for the useless defence of selfish interests. Copenhagen should give two answers to the world  regarding what and when: an ambitious reduction of emissions — the what — and a horizon that is near and defined — the when.  In order to attain those objectives  we also need to think about how. We know that technological research  innovation and development in the area of energy assist in the fight against climate change. That is why Spain has proposed that every State should devote at least 0.7 per cent of its gross domestic product to research  development and innovation in the area of technology and energy. That is a reference figure that  as in the area of development cooperation policy  will help us determine a commitment before the international community. My country also proposes to promote  when we assume the European Union presidency in the first half of 2010  the agreements that we must all adopt at Copenhagen.    09-52320 28   Finally  only one year ago we were struck by a financial crisis that shook every corner of the world. Since then  all of us have suffered the effects of that crisis  but we have also become aware of the need to move ahead in building global governance and have taken resolute steps in that direction. Let us continue on that path  not just to continue fighting against the crisis and for employment  but to overcome it together and successfully address the other global challenges.   Let us use this time for clarity; let us take this opportunity. Let us build a multilateralism that is effective and responsible — above all  a multilateralism of solidarity. Since 1945  there have never been such favourable circumstances for translating the desires of the founders of the United Nations into the reality of the international order. Those desires were intended for succeeding generations. And we are the first generation that has within its reach the ability to fulfil the old and beautiful dream of a world governed by all. Let us do so."
"55",2253,"EST",64,2009,"Over the past year  I  like many others in this Hall  have spoken about the effect of the current global financial crisis on our people and the need for an effective national or international response. Although the crisis is closely related to issues such as peace and security  human rights  development and many other matters of common concern  we cannot let it cast a shadow over all the global challenges that we currently face.  Today  a year after the collapse of the financial markets  cyclical indicators point to economic stabilization. The crisis is not over  however  and the need to restore confidence and repair the financial system remains. Moreover  each of us should make an effort to refrain from raising new barriers and avoid laying the foundations for new global imbalances in the longer run.  In combating climate change  we have finally understood the magnitude of our task and I would like to thank the Secretary-General for hosting the Summit on Climate Change a few days ago. We are not running a 100-metre sprint  but rather a marathon  where one must maintain speed. If we manage to stay on track we all shall be winners in the end. But time is running out. Melting glaciers  frequent and abnormally large hurricanes  floods and heat waves — this is not the planet that we want to leave to our children.  Global and united efforts are needed to reach a comprehensive and ambitious post-2012 climate agreement in Copenhagen this December. I call upon all countries to set binding goals to share the burden. Responsibility must be proportional to the harm that is caused. I am convinced that applying the “polluter-pays” principle would motivate the biggest polluters to multiply their efforts and would therefore have the greatest effect.  Green energy production  renewable energy  energy efficiency and diversification of energy sources — all these contribute not only to sustainable environmental and economic development but also to our security  as we will become less dependent on exhaustible fossil fuels.  As an essential part of cutting greenhouse gas emissions  we foresee a wider use of renewable energy in Estonia  particularly biomass and wind energy. By the end of the year  an Estonian Energy and Climate Agency will be established to help consumers cut energy expenditures and support building energy-efficient homes. This is but one example of how an ambitious climate policy can be used to trigger new growth in the economy.  To uphold the core of the United Nations Charter  we must remain committed to providing the United Nations with sufficient resources to fulfil its unique role in contributing to international security. Compliance with the basic principles enshrined in the Charter  including the obligation of all Members to refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State  must remain the fundamental basis of the United Nations agenda. The United Nations should remain engaged in areas of tension where it can make a contribution.  My delegation takes this opportunity to reiterate its firm support for the security and stability of Georgia  based on full respect for the principles of independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity.  I follow with deep concern the situation in Afghanistan. It is essential that the election process deliver results that are legitimate in the eyes of the Afghans. The future of Afghanistan lies in the hands of the Afghan people; we  the international community  can only help. By consolidating the efforts of the new Government and the international community  lasting progress can and should be achieved. Estonia is one of the countries that have steadily increased their military and civilian contribution to Afghanistan.  I am convinced that the bolstered role and greater visibility of the United Nations throughout the country has a positive impact on the coordination of development activities that in turn will attract more    09-52463 10  non-governmental organizations and other international organizations to the area.  Besides conflicts between and inside States  new and asymmetrical cross-border threats have also emerged: the threat from the Internet  for example. Cyber threats not only endanger vital information technology systems but they endanger entire communities. Concurrently with the rapid development of computer technology we are witnessing alarming signs of more sinister developments: cyber attacks are growing more complex and are increasing in frequency. Consequently  major cooperative efforts by both the governmental and the private sectors are required to develop more effective response capabilities.  This growing global concern demands both a better coordinated international approach and an enhanced legal domestic framework  including steps to criminalize malevolent cyber acts. Our long-term aim should be the creation of a universal cyber culture — a universally accessible  secure and safe environment for all.  Regarding humanitarian affairs  our task is equally challenging. Global ecological instability  political and military conflicts  combined with economic instability and population growth  are expected to increase humanitarian needs considerably and require that our efforts be multiplied in the future. We must stand ready to provide a more predictable  equitable and consistently effective response to humanitarian crises. The growing needs require an increase in the amount of assistance  in coordination and in the range of donors.  True  we all have economic concerns at the moment  but it is vital to keep our commitments to providing humanitarian relief. Today’s short-sighted financial decisions or fading political will may in the end become far more expensive and entail severe long-term consequences.  I would like to commend the excellent work done by the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and Member States in making the coordination among humanitarian workers more efficient and implementing the cluster system. The launch of the Central Emergency Response Fund three years ago has also proven a justified effort in providing more rapid and equitable response allocations to disaster-affected areas. As Estonia  together with Ireland  currently co-chairs the Good Humanitarian Donorship initiative  we urge all donors to apply the principles of good humanitarian donorship to make humanitarian aid more needs-based and its financing more flexible.  As a sign of the priority we give to global humanitarian issues  Estonia this year holds a vice-presidency of the Economic and Social Council and has been leading humanitarian discussions in that body. I am concerned that in many humanitarian situations  especially in conflict situations  adherence to humanitarian principles has become selective  hindering safe and timely access to victims. I fully concur with Under-Secretary-General John Holmes that this is not an ideological luxury but a practical necessity to help ensure timely access as well as the safety and security of humanitarian staff.  It goes without saying that expectations are higher during trying times  and therefore the United Nations actions in carrying out its objectives have increasingly come under scrutiny. Yet  how is the Organization to live up to those high expectations when the United Nations is struggling to reform itself? Over the past years  Member States have undertaken considerable efforts to improve the United Nations system  while one important element  Security Council reform  still remains pending. While recognizing that the reform process is complex  we must also realize that there will be severe consequences if the process remains incomplete.  Regarding another reform area — gender reform — considerable progress that is also relevant to achieving the Millennium Development Goals has been made recently. No security  development or human rights-related goal can be achieved without the full participation of women. Estonia has been a dedicated supporter of the United Nations funds and programmes that foster gender equality. It is our common obligation to ensure that reform becomes a reality without delay.  Facing the first financial crisis of the twenty-first century and the accelerating global warming process  we see the necessity for a united response growing. This is why we  the leaders of all nations  once again have gathered here this week: to remind ourselves to keep our eyes on the horizon of peace and prosperity and to make sure that we are in the same boat."
"56",2299,"ETH",64,2009,"It is indeed a great pleasure for me to extend my warmest congratulations to Mr. Ali Treki on his election to preside over the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session.  Permit me also to express my appreciation to the outgoing President for his effective leadership during the course of the previous session of the General Assembly.  We are grateful to our Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  for the tireless efforts that he exerts to ensure that the United Nations fulfils its purpose during this complex and crucial period in our collective history. I wish to thank him  in particular  for the initiative he took to convene the special Summit on Climate Change this past week.  It has now been 18 years since we  Ethiopians  managed to remove a military dictatorship of    09-52592 38  unprecedented cruelty. The consequences of lack of democracy within the context of great diversity are all too apparent. Ethiopia’s diversity leaves no room for autocracy  dictatorship  military — of whatever variety — cannot mix with the sociological make-up of the country. That was the explanation why Ethiopia was at the edge of the cliff during the last years of the military Government.  The last 18 years have not been easy for Ethiopians. We had to begin again in every aspect of our lives  without exception. There was hardly any economic development throughout the entire 17 years of military dictatorship. Even prior to military rule  Ethiopia faced not just the lack of democracy  but also a stagnant economy and lack of development.  However  the challenges of the last 18 years have not been limited to the weight of the past  to our legacy  in both the political and economic areas. We also had to face other challenges which have not been inconsequential in terms of affecting the tempo of our democratization and development. These challenges  however daunting they are  do not undermine our achievements  over the last 18 years  to democratize our country and lay the basis for rapid economic development.  In both areas  the historic trajectory of the country has shifted. No matter what detractors might say  Ethiopia is now a country with a future and great hope. During the entire long history of the country  we have never witnessed two-digit economic growth  yet we are slated to register that rate of growth this year. That would constitute our sixth consecutive year of such a level of achievement  and it has been attained despite pressures coming from the global economic crisis.  In democratic governance  the new Ethiopia has irrevocably split from the old Ethiopia in terms of both individual and group rights. With respect to the latter category of rights  Ethiopia  as has so emphatically been asserted in our Constitution  is no longer a prison of nations and nationalities. In terms of respect for individual political and human rights  if hard facts — and not an extraneous political agenda — are the measure  Ethiopia is now  all things considered  not at the tail end of countries  but in the vanguard  for its commitment to this value as well as in practice.  However  over the last 18 years we have had many challenges whose negative effects cannot be overlooked. I would like to say a few words about each of the challenges that we have had  and continue  to face.  The first is in the area of peace and security. Obviously  Ethiopia is part of the Horn of Africa. As a neighbour sharing a longer border with Somalia than any other country and with a large population of Ethiopian Somalis  we have been affected by what goes on in that sisterly country; indeed  it would be a miracle if that were not the case.   Now  speaking of Somalia  it is time that we abandon the fiction that the war there is just among Somalis. It is not. Somalia is being hijacked by foreign fighters who uninhibitedly proclaim that their agenda has nothing to do with Somalia. Theirs is an ambition that goes well beyond Somalia  and they say that loud and clear. Those who advise them not to be so blunt have not succeeded.  The Somali crisis has been with us as long as the new Ethiopian Government has been around. It is not just that we lost a partner because of the absence of a functioning Government in Mogadishu. We have also been directly affected by the crisis — a crisis  let us not forget  that is assisted and abetted by others  including by States whose authorities move with ease in and rub shoulders with members of civilized circles. It is not only rogue States  but also States that are ostensibly decent that continue to fuel extremism in Somalia and to fund its activities.  Let us call a spade a spade. Today in Somalia  there is greater coordination and cooperation among those who assist the extremists than among those who profess support for the Transitional Federal Government (TFG) of Somalia. The consequences are obvious. As the latest horrific suicide attack on the African Union Mission in Somalia has shown  those destroying Somalia are being emboldened and their supporters rewarded.  Conversely  the TFG authorities continue to lose confidence  as pledged support continues to dwindle in practice. The international community is being stingy even with the symbolic steps of showing resolve against extremists and spoilers in Somalia. The countries of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) spoke with one voice and appealed to the United Nations Security Council. African heads of State and Government endorsed unanimously the IGAD call for the Security Council to   39 09-52592  stand up and be counted in support of the fight against extremism in Somalia. However  it appears that the Council does not consider Somalia to be a priority.  In the meantime  those supporting extremism have made Somalia a priority. It is critical that the international community wake up before the hijacking of Somalia by extremism is fully consummated. It is therefore unlikely that the Horn of Africa will soon rid itself of the crisis in Somalia  and there will be consequences for the work we have to do in our country in terms of development  fighting poverty and speeding up the process of democratization.  That is why the peace process in the Sudan  and in particular the effective implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement  is so critical for us. The Horn of Africa cannot afford the consequences of failure in the Sudan peace process. We are very close to both parties in the Sudan  and that is an asset that we want to use wisely.  It would be naïve to believe that the conditions of peace and stability in our region have no influence over our domestic agenda. They do. Open societies are manifestly vulnerable to the kind of situation prevailing in the Horn of Africa. The mix of extremist forces and rogue States is not conducive to the growth of democracy in close proximity.  We have other challenges as well. One has to do with climate change. It is gratifying to us Ethiopians that this challenge is drawing the attention of the world more than ever before. I wish to reiterate our appreciation of the effort deployed by the Secretary-General in this regard. We look forward to the international community’s taking resolute action in Copenhagen on the basis of the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities.  We in Ethiopia have been affected by climate change in the most difficult and complex ways. The effect on our agriculture and on our plan for food security has been enormous. It is no longer every decade or so that we face drought  but rather every three to four years. If not drought  then we face floods. Either way  the consequences have been enormously damaging to our plan to ensure food security.  Let me take this opportunity to thank all those partners who have stood with us to address and mitigate the adverse effects of climate change on our agricultural activities. I wish to thank in particular Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for organizing a meeting on partnering for food security on this very day.  As for the Copenhagen climate change summit  it is indeed gratifying that we in Africa have decided to be innovative with respect to our representation and in connection with our approach to negotiation. Africa has decided to be represented by a single team of delegates which will negotiate on the basis of a common African position. It is an honour for Ethiopia  in the person of its Prime Minister  to lead the African negotiating team. We expect much from Copenhagen.  We have had yet another challenge to our development and to the effort we have been making to deepen the progress of democratization in our country over the past 18 years. This has to do with the less-than-conducive international economic — and  I might add  political — environment within which we have to operate. What we have faced on both scores  economic and political  has been a lack of tolerance for diversity  policy-space experimentation and independent thinking. Unjustified conditionalities have abounded  both for economic and political reasons — on the one hand because of strategies derived from market fundamentalism and on the other because we dared defend ourselves against unjustified aggression. Ethiopia’s first real attempt at economic development coincided with the period when market orthodoxy made the role of the State anathema. Perhaps times have changed.  We could have achieved more over the past 18 years  but what we have indeed achieved in the democratization of our society and in economic and social development is not insignificant. In fact  as I have already stated  what we have witnessed in Ethiopia over the past decade and a half is no less than a change in the trajectory of the country’s development. Moreover  we have also continued to discharge our multilateral responsibilities in our own subregion  on our continent as members of the African Union  and in the world beyond in connection with our obligations to the United Nations.  In our own region  along with other members of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development  we have done whatever is necessary and within the limits of our capacity to help Somalia achieve peace and to shield it from the onslaught of extremist forces. As part of the African Union  we continue to discharge our    09-52592 40  responsibilities to maintain the pan-Africanist tradition  to contribute to the peace and security of the continent  and to accelerate the integration process of the continent brick by brick.  The United Nations is an Organization which we cannot live without. We benefit from the Organization in more ways than one. We also take our obligation to it very seriously. It is in that spirit that we continue to strengthen our contribution to the United Nations peacekeeping efforts. In this we shall continue without fail. It is for that reason that I wish to conclude by reiterating Ethiopia’s commitment to the United Nations and by affirming our commitment to all efforts at reforming the Organization  including the Security Council."
"57",2345,"FIN",64,2009,"Let me begin by congratulating you  Sir  on your election as President of the General Assembly. I assure you of our full support in your important functions.  As many colleagues have already underlined  the international climate negotiations are at a crucial stage. The Copenhagen Conference is a real possibility for change. We need political determination and solidarity to reach a new climate agreement that is global  effective and fair. The responsibility lies with all of us — industrial countries  emerging economies and developing countries alike — to take the decisions that will so profoundly shape the future of humankind.  I thank the Secretary-General for convening the Summit on Climate Change at the beginning of the current session of the General Assembly. We had a good discussion on issues that still need to be addressed before December. The meeting delivered a clear message that we are committed to working hard to seal the deal.  A global climate agreement is a precondition for comprehensive sustainable development. The poorest are the most vulnerable when struggling with the adverse effects of climate change. The new agreement must include elements of solidarity and international support in coping with the needs of adaptation. Climate change will affect especially seriously the lives and livelihoods of women  but women are also powerful actors in combating it. We need to ensure their full participation in the negotiations and in the implementation of the new agreement.  Gender  food production and climate change are all interlinked. We know that 70 per cent of the world’s poor are women and girls. We also know that the   45 09-52425  majority of agricultural labourers are women. If we really want to combat climate change and avoid a global food crisis  we need to pay close attention to the role of women  especially in least developed countries.  While the negative consequences of climate change are universal  their impact on small island developing States and countries with low-lying coastal areas is particularly grave. Those countries are threatened by the rise of sea levels and by extreme weather conditions. They need particular attention and assistance.  In September 2000  we committed ourselves here to a new global partnership to reduce extreme poverty and to reach the Millennium Development Goals. We reiterated that pledge at the 2005 World Summit. Now  in 2009  we have to demonstrate our resolve to live up to that commitment when faced with a contracting world economy as well.   The solution of the current financial and economic crisis should be based on the concept of fair globalization. Our action  while striving to achieve sustainable economic growth  must address the goal of decent work for all. It is really essential that we honour our commitments to development in spite of our budget constraints.  In the world economy  the tectonic plates are in motion and new actors are emerging. We need to develop a new global consensus on business ethics  integrity and sustainable economic growth. We must work together so that trust in international financial institutions can be re-established. Let us make them more transparent  accountable and sustainable.  I sincerely hope that the Pittsburgh summit of the Group of 20 will agree on further measures for global recovery. But we should also make full use of the United Nations to promote inclusive and equitable cooperation on issues that are truly global.  While climate change and the global economic downturn cause problems in many parts of the world  Africa is the continent that suffers the most. The international community must remain attentive to Africa’s needs. I am glad to note that positive developments have also taken place in Africa. During this decade  the number of conflicts in Africa has decreased. The African Union is committed to strengthening the organization’s capacity in conflict prevention. Finland is contributing to that important effort by supporting the build-up of the peace mediation structures of the African Union.  The latest developments in the Middle East peace process provide a reason for cautious optimism. It seems that the parties are willing to take some steps. Countries outside the region are committed to supporting those efforts. It is my belief that  with that broadening consensus  we can reactivate the peace process soon.  Finland values highly the United Nations Charter and the central role given to the Security Council. We actively participate in efforts to make that body more representative and efficient. Finland is a candidate to become a non-permanent member of the Security Council for the period 2013 to 2014. At the same time  we hope that progress on the Council’s reform can be made during this session of the General Assembly.  Security Council resolutions 1325 (2000) and 1820 (2008) on women  peace and security were important achievements. Their implementation in all countries and in all situations is urgently needed. The international colloquium on women’s empowerment  leadership development and international peace and security  which was held last March in Monrovia  adopted a call to action on resolution 1325 (2000) and a call for action on gender and climate change. As a follow-up to the colloquium  Finland and Liberia convened a side event today here at the United Nations. In a word  it was a success. I hope that the next success will be in Copenhagen  and that women will make a contribution to it.   Security Council resolution 1820 (2008) strongly condemns sexual violence in conflicts. We must treat systematic rape as a forbidden weapon of war. Victims of rape and sexual abuse must have access to legal processes  and rapists must be prosecuted and condemned. In our view  the appointment of a special representative of the Secretary-General on women and armed conflict would enhance the implementation of those resolutions. We hope that all Member States will support that proposal. I want to thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for bringing up the question of violence against women in his opening address to the General Assembly yesterday.  Civilian populations need protection in conflict situations. At the United Nations World Summit in 2005  the responsibility to protect was accepted as a general principle applicable to genocide  crimes against    09-52425 46  humanity  ethnic cleansing and war crimes. Further efforts are urgently needed to save civilians from violence.  This morning  the Security Council held a debate on nuclear security issues. I am sure that we are all pleased that disarmament is now strongly returning to the international agenda. I sincerely hope that that will lead to real progress.  Finally  I would like to underline that we have to try to find things that unite us — and not things that divide us — if we want to be midwives of the future and not guardians of the past. Lasting peace can be built only through open dialogue between cultural and religious communities  in our countries and worldwide. Finland supports all initiatives  such as the Alliance of Civilizations  to stimulate intercultural communication. I wish those efforts the best of success in promoting mutual understanding and peace. I promise that Finland will support them."
"58",2389,"FJI",64,2009,"I extend our warm greetings to the President and to this Assembly. I congratulate him on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at this sixty-fourth session. I pay tribute to his predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann  for presiding over the sixty-third session with great sensitivity and for bringing a human face to our work.  The sixty-fourth session of the General Assembly will address important contemporary issues of interest to all Member nations. Such issues include seeking out effective responses to global crises and strengthening multilateralism and dialogue on international peace  security and development. Those issues are indeed of critical importance to my own country  a small island developing State that has been enriched by its membership of and participation in the United Nations.  Fiji and its people  like all small developing island States  are among the first victims of contemporary global crises  such as the financial and economic crisis  the 2009 H1N1 pandemic and  most dramatic of all  the phenomenon of climate change. In small economies like ours  those global events have a very real effect on the daily livelihoods of our people. For our part  we have attempted to respond to some of those crises by making policy changes and adjustments  encouraging our people to grow their own food and discouraging food imports wherever possible. Over the past two years  the size of our public service has been rationalized. We have maintained a very streamlined Cabinet structure and significantly controlled Government operational costs.  There have been critics of the events in Fiji since December 2006  when the military  with great reluctance  was forced to remove the then Government of Fiji. I believe that these critics are largely unaware of the extent to which politicians  in league with those who employ terror as a tactic to push racial supremacy and a corrupt agenda  had become a threat to the safety and security of our people. Terrorism has become a global issue and it impacts Fiji as well. We are fully cooperating in the international effort to control and contain this scourge.  Next year on 10 October  Fiji will celebrate the fortieth year of its independence and the fortieth anniversary of its membership in the United Nations. We embraced our independence full of enthusiasm  excited by the prospect of deciding our own future and believing that our community as a whole would work   5 09-52592  together to achieve a better life for all of our people. Our path has not been smooth or easy.  The President of Fiji abrogated the Constitution on 10 April this year. He took this step when a Court of Appeal ruling created a legal vacuum — a constitutional anomaly which would have also prevented implementation of the reforms which were mandated by him in order to achieve a truly democratic State.  On 1 July of this year  I announced a road map to lead Fiji to a new constitution and elections based on equality  equal suffrage  human rights  justice  transparency  modernity and true democratic ideals. My Government and I were mandated to carry out and to continue the reforms  which will ensure that true  democratic  non-communal and equal suffrage-based elections for parliamentary representation will be held by September 2014. A road map to implement this mandate was announced on 1 July of this year.  Together with stringent steps to protect our economy from the effects of the world economic crisis  work will commence on a new constitution by September 2012. The basis for the new constitution will be the ideals and principles formulated by the People’s Charter for Change and Progress  a document prepared following widespread consultations with and input from the people of Fiji. The People’s Charter was adopted by the President after the endorsement of the majority of the people of Fiji.   Work on the new constitution will involve consultations with all the ordinary citizens of our country  as well as with civil society. Consultations will focus on issues such as the size of the new parliament  the sustainability of a bicameral system  the terms of office of Government  and systems of accountability of Government to the people. The new constitution will implement reforms and the results of extensive consultations and will be in place by September 2013. This will give the people of Fiji a year to become familiar with its provisions before the elections take place in September 2014.  There have been critics of this timeline. These critics have asked why work on the new constitution will not commence before September 2012. The answer is very simple  at least to those who know and understand Fiji’s history. Fiji has a colonial history that has created many anomalies and inequalities and whose legacy resonates today. Consequently and due also to the politicians  our post-colonial period has been punctuated by political instability. On each occasion that a new Government has been voted into power  the old elite which benefited financially from the previous established Government has been able to successfully destabilize the Government and to replace it with its own supporters and representatives. This was possible only because those institutions of the State that were supposed to protect democracy and democratic values instead colluded with the elite to destabilize and replace the new Government.   And that is not all. Fiji has suffered more than 20 years of mismanagement  corruption and nepotism. Our infrastructure  our judicial system and our systems of accountability have all remained underdeveloped and unproductive. Many of our finest brains have left the country because they could see no future in a country governed by ethno-nationalism  corruption and greed. In order to ensure that democracy has a real chance of survival in Fiji’s future  serious and principled reforms must be implemented to build roads  institutions and values.  Together with infrastructure  the hearts and minds of our people must adopt and cherish true democracy. The way of the old elite must never triumph again. There must be reforms before elections to ensure that democracy is sustainable for Fiji’s long-term future. The people of Fiji deserve better than the short-term band-aid solutions we have experienced over the past decades.  I ask for patience and understanding  particularly from our neighbours  who have shown a surprising lack of understanding and disregard of the peculiar situation which our country has experienced since independence. Put another way  there is an almost blind faith that once independence has been granted to those who were under colonial rule and the machinery of democracy begins to work  the country concerned will enjoy smooth sailing. Nothing could be further from the truth. I invite the international community to engage with us  to visit our country to see the situation  and to provide practical support and assistance to enable us to implement the reforms.  History is replete with the struggles of people the world over for self-determination in order to be free from subjugation and foreign domination. Our own experience should have provided some indication  if    09-52592 6  one is needed  of how difficult it has been for us to achieve true  genuine and sustainable democracy.  Many of the nations represented in this Hall today have experienced the traumas of nation-building. It would not be out of place to reflect on what President Obama said during his address to the General Assembly on Wednesday  23 September:   “Democracy cannot be imposed on any nation from the outside. Each society must search for its own path  and no path is perfect. Each country will pursue a path rooted in the culture of its people and in its past traditions.” ()  We thoroughly endorse such sentiments.  Our dream is for equality  for justice and for security. Our dream is for dignity and for economic well-being. Our dream is for true democracy. I thank those of our friends who have had continued dialogue with me and my Government and who have helped us to achieve what they themselves now take for granted. I thank Fiji’s friends for their respect and understanding even when we agree to differ on some issues. If there is to be genuine dialogue at both the regional and the international levels  there must be a willingness to listen and to respect a different point of view.  To those nations that have refused to engage with Fiji and have expressed an unwillingness to enter into dialogue  I can only repeat my plea that they change their stance. Fiji is a small nation. Our people pose no threat to anyone  least of all to the big Powers of the South Pacific that have arrogated to themselves the right to dictate to us our future and the way we govern ourselves. We respect the right of anyone who disagrees with us to exercise their freedom. However  that does not give them the right to interfere with our efforts to build a better country for our people.  In addition to all of this  they have used their extensive diplomatic and financial resources to deny Fiji the ability to participate in new peacekeeping operations. Fiji has participated in peacekeeping operations since 1978 and is proud of its association with the United Nations  in particular with the Department of Peacekeeping Operations. Indeed  the Fiji Military Forces  since the beginning of their participation in peacekeeping  have established a reputation for professionalism  skill and rapport with the communities in their areas of operation.  Fiji has been disappointed by what appears to be a unilateral decision on the part of the United Nations to debar our country from any new peacekeeping operations. To this day  we have not been able to receive a clear and satisfactory reply from the Organization on this matter. I express the hope that the United Nations will deal equitably and fairly with troop-contributing countries.  Our experiences as a member of the United Nations  particularly in the area of peacekeeping  will be strengthened and enhanced by our People’s Charter and the road map to the elections. Those documents aptly demonstrate the positive values of genuine dialogue and engagement. We believe that  if we are to achieve genuine peace  security and development in our country  we must build on a foundation of patience and respect for all views.  Like most small island nations  Fiji regards the threat posed by climate change as one that will undermine international peace and security. The lives of real people from real places are at stake. The future survival of real generations  the continuation of real cultures and the security of belonging to a real homeland are being threatened.  The adverse impacts of climate change will be politically blind; its devastating effects on humanity will far outweigh any ideology or system of belief devised by man. The potential casualties resulting from its impacts could be far greater than those caused by any of the battles we have ever fought. Yet the ability to reverse its onslaught is well within our collective control.  Fiji is thankful to the general membership of the Assembly for adopting  at its previous session  a resolution promoted by small island developing States linking the threat of climate change to security. Some of Fiji’s closest neighbours live on the lowest-lying atolls in the world. The rise in sea level brought about by climate change threatens literally to drown them. Why should they be forced to abandon their homeland for no fault of their own? All human beings have the right to live in their ancestral homeland  if they so choose.  It is vital to understand that no measure of financial assistance can resurrect what has submerged  generate rain to end drought  reverse the effects of natural disasters or replace what has been lost as a result of climate change. No small island State can   7 09-52592  survive the future by merely mitigating the impacts of climate change. Adaptation and mitigation are not enough. We can halt the impact of climate change and ensure the survival of island States only by significantly reducing carbon emissions.  It is on the basis of that premise that Fiji  as one of the States that are more vulnerable to the impacts of climate change  calls on all nations — in particular the major emitters — to be responsible and commit themselves to the carbon emission reduction targets of approximately 45 per cent from 1990 levels by 2020 and 85 per cent by 2050  with a global atmosphere concentration of less than 350 parts per million; and  further  to limit temperature increases to less than 1.5 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial level by 2020. I wish to emphasize that  realistically  that is the minimum reduction level that will allow us to address the devastating impacts of climate change that we currently face.  To fail to meet those targets would be to make the probability of risk astoundingly high for the most vulnerable. To negotiate on those targets would mean negotiating on the lives of millions. The inequity that exists in terms of the extent of our vulnerabilities and abilities to meet mitigating costs vis-à-vis our contributions to climate change has divided our views and weakened our collective strength to deal with this global issue. Those inequitable circumstances are further complicated by the conflicting political and economic interests of States. Understandably  decisions and positions are based on national self-interests  which  in most cases  take priority over the principles of equity and responsibility.  Those are the differences that have given rise to the challenges that we currently face as an international community in arriving at a binding international agreement that responds to the current most fundamental need of the world: its survival.  Fiji hopes that political goodwill and compromise will be found on the road to Copenhagen and that the necessary platform will soon be found for a fair  effective and ambitious climate change regime that ensures significant reductions in carbon emissions and the creation of a financial regime that supports the adaptation and mitigation needs of every country  particularly the most vulnerable ones.  My Government is committed to upholding the principles and values enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations  the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other United Nations conventions. We are resolutely committed to the elimination of all policies and laws that are inconsistent with our international obligations. We wish to create a new and brighter future for our people based on equality  dignity and respect.  We seek the understanding of the General Assembly and the community of nations  as well as their support in fulfilling our dreams."
"59",2436,"FRA",64,2009,"In speaking to the General Assembly in France’s name today  I am well aware that we all have a historic responsibility in the current circumstances.  In the midst of a financial  economic and social crisis that has no precedent in the history of the United Nations  and faced with the threat a global ecological disaster  we must now invent a new world where the follies of yesterday are no longer possible. That is our responsibility. Now we all know towards what catastrophes our obstinate attempts to solve the problems of the twenty-first century with twentieth-century ideas and instruments may lead us. No one among us can claim any longer that he did not know. There is a universal awareness that the path that the world has taken over the past few decades is a dead end. This awareness is born of sorrow  suffering and fear. We are politically and morally accountable for the suffering on our planet. Tens of millions of men and women have lost their jobs and their homes. A billion human beings are suffering from hunger  and hundreds of millions have no access to water  energy or minimal health care.  To those hundreds of millions of people  we  the heads of State and Government  and no one else  must restore hope. Those who are paying the price of the crisis had no role in bringing it about. We owe an answer to the people who are outraged by the behaviour of those in the financial world who led us to the brink of chaos and continue to seek to enrich themselves indecently. We owe an answer to those who are still dying in absurd wars from another age  while humankind has so many challenges to face.   France’s answer is unambiguous. Things cannot go on as they were. We must change. We cannot allow it to start all over again  leading to another disaster tomorrow. After such a strong disavowal of our usual thinking and our deep-rooted prejudices  the task before us is precisely the same as that faced by men of good will who sought here to build a new political  economic and monetary world order after the Second World War. The generation that preceded us was equal to its responsibilities. The question today is: Will we be equal to that same responsibility?  The world will change. It cannot be otherwise. The only question is: Will the world change because we are able to act with wisdom  intelligence and courage  or because fresh crises will arise if we are not wise enough to take the path of radical change?  The truth is that we have already waited too long to regulate globalization  fight global warming and curb nuclear proliferation. And I should like solemnly to tell the leaders of Iranian that they would be making a tragic mistake in relying on the passive response of the international community in order to pursue their military nuclear programme.   We have waited too long to re-establish peace in the Middle East by giving the Palestinian people the State to which they are entitled in the name of law and in the name of justice. And we have waited too long to guarantee the people of Israel the right to live in security  which the tragedies of history have made so necessary for them.  We know what we need to do now: increase the number of permanent and non-permanent members of the Security Council. I say in the name of France  it is unacceptable that the African continent does not have a single permanent member on the Security Council — it is unacceptable because it is unjust. It is unacceptable that the South American continent  with such a great power as Brazil  or India with its population of one billion  or Japan or Germany  should be excluded from among the permanent members of the Council. It is unacceptable  and I say here that the legitimacy of the United Nations is riding on this reform. Either the United Nations reforms and its legitimacy will grow  or    09-52179 46  the reform fails and then decisions will be taken outside the United Nations.   We must reform the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank; that is indispensable. Voting rights need to be more equitably distributed. The missions of both the Fund and the Bank need to be redefined. To maintain the Fund as the guardian of an orthodoxy that has been so severely shaken by the crisis would be a tragic mistake.   The international system has to be reformed. We cannot have a politically multipolar world with a single currency. That is not acceptable; it is not possible. We have to re-engineer the financial capitalism system. If we have a system in which the real price of risk or the real price of rare resources is not being paid  that is a suicidal system.   We need to eliminate tax havens  for we must not tolerate places where money derived from speculation  crime and fraud is stashed. It is up to us. No one in the world would understand if we were to fail to live up to this objective.   We need to curb the price swings of commodities that are subject to excessive speculation  starting with oil  since this instability is unsustainable. The countries that have commodities must be paid a fair price for their resources. We must not accept the speculation that destabilizes the world over the costs of commodities.  In Copenhagen  we need to commit to quantitative targets for greenhouse gas emissions. We can no longer put off the moment of choice. We need to set up a world environment organization. We need to acknowledge the legitimacy of the principle of a carbon tax border adjustment mechanism so that nobody can profit from environmental dumping.   We cannot let the law of trade be the only law. I believe in free trade  but there are fundamental standards. We are members of the World Health Organization. How can we impair the right to health of those who have nothing? We are members of the International Labour Organization  which has defined the fundamental standards in this field. How can we accept that those standards be flouted? The right to health  the right to a minimum respect for one’s social rights and the right to protection of the planet are just as important as the right to trade. There is no single right that is more important than the others.  We cannot ask developing countries and poor countries to comply with these standards if we  the rich  do not help them in their efforts. We all belong to the same human race. We all live on the same planet. We are all facing the same challenges.   So yes  we need to be able to share our technology. France is ready to do so  and so are the other wealthy countries of the world. Yes  we will need to come up with further resources for development assistance and for meeting the ecological challenge together. I do not hesitate to say that we will find these resources by taxing excessive gains from speculation and profits. We do not have to look far for resources; they are right there. I would like to appeal to all States  to all international organizations  that the recommendations made by the commission chaired by Joseph Stiglitz be disseminated broadly. Let us make no mistake about the way we measure economic growth.   The task is a huge one  and it is only just beginning. That is all the more reason for starting now and starting quickly. We have little time remaining. Each of us needs to realize what would happen if we had to go home and explain to our fellow citizens that we have been incapable of reaching an agreement  of finding new solutions at a time when they are suffering so grievously from the consequences of the crisis. I wish to say very clearly that nothing would be worse that a mediocre compromise in Pittsburgh and in Copenhagen. World opinion and the current circumstances demand that we find a real solution to the problems and not just to pretend.  If we do nothing  the threat of the worst crisis is not behind us but ahead of us. We are at one of those moments in history when political decisions will have a profound and lasting impact on the future. We have no choice; we must take risks  since the greatest risk today would be to do nothing  to let ourselves be carried along by the force of habit  to think that we still have time. France has come to tell you that we have no more time.   I hope that this year  2009  is when a new world order — a more fair  more efficient world order — will be established  one that each of us will be comfortable with."
"60",2461,"FSM",64,2009,"I wish to offer my warm congratulations to Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. We are confident that he will live up to the high standards set by his esteemed predecessor.  Allow me to begin my remarks today by thanking members of the General Assembly for their positive   5 09-52470  action this past June in adopting resolution 63/281  on climate change and its possible security implications. Developed and developing countries alike worked together with the smallest and most vulnerable to do something that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago. It is now becoming all the more compelling that we work together  as we did in adopting that resolution  to act decisively in confronting this threat.  The importance of this groundbreaking resolution cannot be overstated. Its message is clear: climate change is a threat to international peace and security. The resolution is a historic milestone for this body. Climate change  including its far-reaching effects and its security implications  is the defining issue for the world today — an issue that should command the attention and support of everyone.  When we met here last year  the world economy was going through a time of unprecedented crisis. Fearing that the global economy was heading for collapse  the world stood together and  with strong determination and swiftness  adopted difficult but concrete measures aimed at averting that global disaster. In keeping with the spirit of cooperation  it is indispensable for the international community to be steadfast and bold enough to take equally difficult decisions to address the climate change crisis without delay. Accelerating action by and cooperation among Governments  the private sector and civil society is imperative in order to meet the challenge posed by climate change.   Given the critical importance of climate change to my country  allow me to address that issue here again. I thank the Secretary-General for bringing more attention to climate change and for convening the high-level Summit on Climate Change on 22 September 2009.  For us Micronesians and our fellow Pacific islanders  including those of other parts of the world  climate change is a matter of survival as peoples  cultures and nations. For centuries  the people of Micronesia have lived on their small islands  many less than a metre above sea level. They have enjoyed a life dependent on the bounties of the sea and the harvest from the land. They have developed a culture of respect for nature and have lived in harmony with their natural surroundings. They built outrigger canoes and rigged them with sails from pandanus leaves. Long before Magellan  they sailed the vast expanse of the Pacific Ocean  aided only by an intimate understanding of the stars and ocean currents.   Sadly  today’s disregard for our planet is slowly making the ocean that has always nurtured us the very instrument of our destruction. Micronesia is already experiencing the brunt of the negative impacts of climate change. The sea-level rise  changing weather patterns and an increase in the frequency and intensity of natural disasters  such as typhoons  are all undermining our development efforts. The years of El Niño have brought more droughts and increased rainfall  causing substantial damage to staple crops. Our taro patches and arable lands are limited to begin with. Compounding the problem is the intrusion of salt water  damaging basic crops  including taro and coconut trees — our tree of life. What if the melting of polar ice sheets and glaciers were to reach an irreversible point? The outcome is crystal-clear: Micronesia and all low-lying islands would disappear from the face of the Earth. But the effects would go much further  endangering coastal cities and communities all over the world  including Manhattan.  Our vulnerability compels us to take proactive concerted action in seeking fast-track solutions. In that regard  I am pleased to share two specific mitigation measures taken by my Government.  The first action taken by Micronesia is a proposal that has been submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The aim of the proposal is to make a modest beginning to evaluating rapid mitigation strategies by establishing a four-year programme for experts to report on ways to achieve rapid mitigation by dealing with short-lived non-carbon dioxide agents  including black carbon  under the auspices of UNFCCC.  This year  Micronesia and Mauritius proposed a two-part amendment to the Montreal Protocol to phase down the production and use of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). Secondly  our proposal would expand efforts to destroy so-called banks of discarded refrigerants that are harmful to climate. Our proposal  with additional sponsors  has started a global dialogue on the demonstrated versatility of the Montreal Protocol as a treaty for early climate protection.  I want to commend the North American countries for their strong support and action on HFCs. Recently  the United States  Canada and Mexico added their    09-52470 6  support to the proposal to use the Montreal Protocol to phase down HFCs. That kind of cooperation  between developed and developing countries  is what we need. We therefore urge the North American countries and others to support the second part of the amendment proposed by Micronesia and Mauritius.  The bottom line is that Micronesia has already suffered the effects of climate change. We therefore seek to draw the attention of the world to any and all possibilities for rapid mitigation action that could buy us more time while the long-term war against carbon dioxide proceeds.  Allow me now to briefly focus on several other areas of priority to my country. To effectively manage and conserve our biodiversity and limited natural resources  Micronesia continues to work with other Governments in our subregion to meet the commitments of the Micronesia Challenge  which calls for the conservation of at least 30 per cent of the area’s marine resources and 20 per cent of its land resources by 2020. We acknowledge the support of our friends and development partners who have helped us implement that initiative.  As part of our national development agenda  especially in the priority areas of health  education and private sector development  we are seeking to acquire comprehensive broadband connectivity capacity through undersea fibre-optic cable. That will enable us to meet the objectives of the World Summit on the Information Society and the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). We are also taking the necessary measures to liberalize the environment for telecommunications services in order to promote competition and to put in place an appropriate national information and communications technology plan.   To achieve those objectives  we look to the United Nations system  the International Telecommunication Union and our development partners for their support and guidance.   Micronesia is indeed undertaking a wide variety of tasks as it strives to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. We recognize that some of the Goals can be especially difficult for us to sustain  even though we may be on track to achieve them. Progress towards the MDGs is inherently threatened by the nature of our vulnerability to climate change.  As an island State with a large excusive economic zone abundant with marine and fisheries resources  we are naturally concerned about unsustainable fishing practices. We are also concerned about the unabated incidence of illegal  unreported unregulated fishing  which only robs the coastal island nations of their most precious resource  which is fish.  At a time when the world food market is deeply affected by the food crisis and economic turmoil  Micronesians are increasingly dependent on the bounties of the sea to provide their nourishment and their economic development. That is precisely why we remain concerned about the collateral catches and discards in commercial fisheries  as they deprive our people of the critical resources that they depend upon for their subsistence living and that are of cultural importance. The international community must help us to find ways to minimize and eliminate that wasteful harvesting of resources. Economic resources are critical to successfully implementing our nation-building efforts.  Micronesia has a genuine interest in the reform of the Security Council — a Council that must embrace an expansion in both of its membership categories  to be more inclusive and broadly representative and to reflect the present realities of the world in the new century. We urge the President of the Assembly to carry forward the intergovernmental negotiations that were begun during its sixty-third session. I reiterate our support for the candidacies of Japan  India and Germany for permanent membership on the Council.  December is around the corner and the world needs to seal the deal in Copenhagen. The task will not be easy  but we must not fail. Millions of lives are at risk and our homelands are in peril.  Micronesia is a member of the Alliance of Small Island States and our position is well known. We have repeatedly called for a strong agreement that must leave no island behind. Our collective failure to meet this challenge now will lead us towards colossal and irreversible damage to our Mother Earth.  When the health of our planet needs remedy and the lives of millions depend on our action  we must respond and take appropriate and swift action. I am aware that different States have different ideas of what a strong deal means  but mistrust between countries cannot become a reason for failure  nor can economic considerations become an excuse for inaction.   7 09-52470   Throughout the history of humankind  there have been examples of nations that disagreed coming together for their own survival during a crisis  be it during a time of war  economic hardship or epidemic. Today  that crisis is climate change. There is simply no more time to waste  and I will therefore stop here. Talk is cheap; action speaks louder than words. And we need action. Let us go to Copenhagen to seal the deal. We will all meet again in Copenhagen."
"61",2504,"GAB",64,2009,"First  I would like to warmly congratulate Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. I would also like to pay a well-deserved tribute to Father Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann  President of the Assembly at its sixty-third session  for the work he accomplished during his mandate. And I reaffirm the confidence and support of my country for the Secretary-General as he continues his efforts as the leader of this Organization.  Gabon has just gone through a critical phase in its history as a nation. With the loss of President Omar Bongo Ondimba on 8 June  our country saw the start of a delicate period of political transition  during which we had to dig deep to find the strength necessary to confront our destiny. Under the relevant provisions of our founding laws and the leadership of interim President Rose Francine Rogombé  we were able to bring our electoral process to a successful conclusion  culminating in a vote on 30 August. As a result of this unprecedented election  Mr. Ali Bongo Ondimba was officially proclaimed the elected President of the Republic by the Constitutional Court  which under the law has a month to examine claims or appeals resulting from the election before the elected President takes office  given that nine unsuccessful candidates have appealed to the high court.   63 09-52470   As members know  ensuring such an important democratic transition in the brief time allocated under the law was very challenging for our country  and I am proud to say that we have met it  considering what was at stake and what we knew had to be done. I submit here my own tribute to the people of Gabon  the majority of whom have proclaimed their support for the values of peace and democracy. I would also like to thank the peoples of Africa and of the entire world  as well as the representatives of States and international and civil society organizations who came to observe the elections in Gabon and to nourish our democratic process with their experience. As we open a new page in our march towards progress and development  we know we can rely on the international community and on the friends of Gabon all over the world to confront the challenges of today and tomorrow.  As regards those challenges  we are determined  today more than ever before  to spare no effort to establish good political and economic governance and to consolidate our gains and our legacy in the areas of stability  peace and democracy. We are also motivated by our determination to pursue our endeavours in maintaining regional and international peace  by strengthening our links of solidarity and fraternity with all our neighbouring countries.  The sixty-fourth session of the General Assembly is opening its deliberations in an international context marked by a number of successive crises: economic and financial  food  energy and environmental. We must bring urgent and lasting responses to these various crises by acting collectively to curb them and ensuring that our peoples achieve the development they desire with all their heart. The United Nations Conference on the World Financial and Economic Crisis and Its Impact on Development  held in New York from 24 to 30 June  was an important initiative  enabling us to express our concerns and declare our commitment to fighting the crisis and its repercussions for our countries.  The unity we reached on measures to be taken to deal with the crisis will require the complete and unified participation of our countries in developing appropriate solutions. Beyond the specifics relating to each country  we must make sure together that the measures and actions taken to fight the crisis be proportional in scope to its gravity and intensity.  The food crisis was at the centre of our discussions during the sixty-third session of the Assembly and was the focus of two important declarations  one adopted at the High-level Conference on World Food Security  held in Rome from 3 to 5 June 2008  and one adopted at the thirteenth African Union Conference of Heads of State and Government  held in Sirte in July. We must now implement the declarations and measures adopted as a result of meetings held at the international and regional levels. It is only through strict adherence to our commitments that we will be able to identify the adverse effects of such crisis situations on the development of our respective States.  The challenge of feeding a planet whose population is growing is intimately linked to the questions of the environment and climate change. The harmful effects of global warming on our ability to increase agricultural production in such a way as to bring about a lasting solution to the food crisis are no longer in doubt. I am pleased once again that this question was chosen as a theme for the recent high-level dialogue organized by the Secretary-General on the sidelines of the current session  with a view to the forthcoming Copenhagen Climate Conference in December. In this regard  we reaffirm our support for Africa’s common position on climate change  adopted in Addis Ababa in August by the heads of State or Government of the African Union.  My country  Gabon  whose forests are among those that make up the great Congo basin  has adhered unreservedly to the various international conventions concerning the struggle against climate catastrophe and the protection of biodiversity. We have resolved to assume our share of responsibility by dedicating 11 per cent of our territory to humanity  by creating  among other things  13 national parks.  The interdependence of the crises the international community faces highlights  now more than ever before  the need to breathe new life into efforts to ensure international peace and security  but also to conduct collective action at the global level. It is with this conviction that Gabon has submitted its candidacy for a non-permanent seat in the Security Council for the period 2010-2011  for which it was endorsed by the African Union at its thirteenth Conference of Heads of State and Government  held at Sirte in July.    09-52470 64   My country is also convinced that this Organization cannot remain frozen  but must evolve in order to enable it to adapt better to the current international context. It is for this reason that world leaders  through the Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2) and the 2005 World Summit Outcome (resolution 60/1)  reaffirmed the need to strengthen the United Nations to allow it to fulfil its principal missions more effectively.   In that regard  my country welcomes the progress made since the 2005 World Summit in implementing a great many of the important recommendations of the Outcome Document in the framework of the United Nations reform process. While pleased with these major advances  we must continue our efforts to bring these reforms to completion. Building a more just and secure world capable of responding to its peoples’ profound aspirations depends on it."
"62",2551,"GBR",64,2009,"I stand here to reaffirm the Charter of the United Nations  not to tear it up. I call on every nation to support its universal principles.   A year ago  we met on the brink of a global crisis and  as national leaders spoke in turn at this rostrum  the full scale of the danger was becoming clear — a threat not just to jobs  businesses and life savings but  with the imminent risk of failure of the world’s banking system  the prospect of entire countries failing as nations across Eastern Europe  Asia and Latin America struggled to access credit.  That crisis demanded global action. As never before  the fate of every country rested on the actions of all. And as the fear of the unthinkable took hold  we reached a clear choice: to fail separately or to succeed together.  At the G-20 meetings in Washington and again in London  we made our choice. Governments came together to begin the fight back against the global recession. We acted in concert  recognizing that national interests could be protected only by serving the common interest  and that in this new global economy  the economy is indivisible and recession anywhere can threaten prosperity everywhere. We reckoned also that  if growth is to be sustained  it has to be shared. Global problems can be mastered only through global solutions.  So I think that today we can draw strength from the unprecedented unity that has defined the past year. But we cannot be complacent. For while it may seem strange to say so after a time of such intense global cooperation  our world is now entering a six-month period which may prove even more testing for international cooperation together.  I believe that we face five urgent challenges that demand momentous decisions — decisions that I would argue are epoch-making — on climate change  terrorism  nuclear proliferation  shared prosperity and eradicating poverty.  Once again  we are at a point of no return. And just as the collapse of the banks focused our minds a year ago  so we must grasp this next set of challenges immediately.  If we do not reach a climate change deal at Copenhagen  if we miss this great opportunity to agree together to protect our planet  we cannot hope for an easy second chance some time in the future. There will be no retrospective global agreement to undo the    09-52179 52  damage that we have caused. This is the moment now to limit and reverse the climate change we are inflicting on future generations — not later  not at another conference  not in a later decade  after we have already lost 10 years to inaction and delay.  And if  in Afghanistan  we give way to the insurgency and Al-Qaida   other terrorist groups and Al-Qaida will return and  from that sanctuary once again plot  train for and launch attacks on the rest of the world.  There can be no chance  either  of a nuclear-free world if we allow Iran to develop nuclear weapons and  in doing so  set off a new arms race.  There can be no global compact for jobs and growth if we choke off recovery by failing to act together to follow through on the coordinated global fiscal expansion we agreed and have now put in place.  And if we do not act together to prevent avoidable illness  there can be no plan to save tomorrow the 12 000 children who are dying in Africa today and every day.  So I say we do need world agreement on urgent challenges.  Now let me elaborate first on climate change. Despite the promises we have made  the road to a successful outcome in Copenhagen is not assured. Why is that? It is so because  above all  a robust and long-term deal on climate change requires money. If the poorest and most vulnerable are going to be able to adapt; if the emerging economies are going to embark on low-carbon development paths; and if the forest nations are going to slow and stop deforestation  then I know that the richer countries must contribute financially.  That is why I have proposed a new approach to financing our action against climate change. It will provide substantially increased additional and predictable flows. They will be flows of capital from both public and private sectors. They would be worth around $100  billion a year by 2020. In the coming days  we must make progress.  A post-2012 agreement on climate change at Copenhagen is the next great test of our global cooperation. Each of us has a duty of leadership to make sure that it happens. We must build on the discussions at Secretary-General Ban’s meeting this week. I have said that I will go to Copenhagen to conclude the deal because I believe that it is too important an agreement — for the global economy  and for the future of every nation represented here — simply to leave it to chance. So I urge my fellow leaders to commit themselves to backing up our official negotiators by going to Copenhagen too.  I believe that a safer Afghanistan means a safer world. But none of us can be safe if we walk away from that country or from our common mission and resolve. NATO and its partners  from Australia to Japan to other countries  must agree new ways to implement our strategy. I believe that we must ensure that “Afghanization” takes place — that the army  people and the people of Afghanistan assume greater responsibility for the security of their own country.  So  too  must we unite against terror and injustice wherever they are to be found in our world. I believe that it shames us all that the people of Somalia and the Sudan are still subject to the most terrible of violence; that Israel and Palestine have still not found a way to live side by side in security and peace; and that  for the people of Burma  their elected leader is subjected to a show trial and decades of imprisonment. There is more that we can do and more that we must do. And we must carry forward our efforts to make a coherent  strategic and more effective approach to peacekeeping and peacebuilding around the world.  Once there were five nuclear-armed Powers. Now there are nine. The real and present danger is that more will soon follow. And the risk is not just State aggression  but the acquisition of nuclear weapons by terrorists. So we must accept that we are at a moment of danger when decades of preventing proliferation could be overturned by a damaging rise in proliferation. If we are serious about the ambition of a nuclear-free world  we will need statesmanship  not brinksmanship.  Tomorrow’s Security Council resolution will be vital  in my view  as we move forward towards next year’s global nuclear security summit in April and the Review Conference in May. Our proposal is a grand global bargain between nuclear-weapon and  non-nuclear-weapon States. There are three elements to it  where careful and sober international leadership is essential and in which Britain will play its part: the responsibilities of non-nuclear States  the rights of    53 09-52179  non-nuclear States and  of course  the responsibilities of nuclear weapon States.  First  let there be no ambiguity: Iran and North Korea must now know that the world will be even tougher on proliferation. We are ready to consider further sanctions. Britain will insist in future that the onus on non-nuclear States is that in the years ahead it is for them to prove that they are not developing nuclear weapons.  Secondly  Britain will offer civil nuclear power to non-nuclear States who are ready to renounce any plans for nuclear weapons  helping non-nuclear States acquire what President Eisenhower so memorably called “atoms for peace”. With others  we will be prepared to sponsor a uranium bank outside those countries to help them access civil nuclear power. And Britain is ready to launch a new nuclear centre of excellence to help develop an economic low-carbon proliferation-resistant nuclear fuel cycle.  My third point is that all nuclear-weapon States must reciprocally play their part in reducing nuclear weapons as part of an agreement by non-nuclear States to renounce them. This is exactly what the  Non-Proliferation Treaty intended  and in line with maintaining our nuclear deterrent I have asked our National Security Committee to report to me on the potential future reduction of our nuclear weapon submarines from four to three.  While economic cooperation has stabilized the international banking system and forged the foundation for the resumption of economic growth  recovery is neither entrenched nor irreversible. The great lesson of the past year is that only the bold and global action that we took prevented a recession becoming a depression. We have delivered a coordinated monetary and fiscal response that the International Labour Organization estimates has saved 7 million to 11 million jobs across the world.  So at Pittsburgh  when the Group of 20 (G-20) meets tomorrow  we must cement a global compact for jobs and growth — a compact to bring unemployment down and bring rising prosperity across the globe. We must maximize the impact of the stimulus measures we have agreed. There must be proper planning of exit strategies together to make sure the recovery does not falter. We do not and must not turn off the life support for our economy prematurely. We must also facilitate agreement setting clear objectives on how each of us can contribute to worldwide growth in the future  and we must ensure that such future growth is balanced and sustainable.  I believe we need stronger economic cooperation now as we navigate the uncertainties of recovery. I therefore propose we launch the compact by agreeing that we are committed to high levels of growth on a sustainable and balanced basis. This must be backed up by comprehensive reform of the financial sector. It must include international principles on bonuses. We must strengthen our targeting of tax havens. From next month  real sanctions must be meted out against those jurisdictions that fail to meet global standards.  The voice of Africa will have to be heard and heeded to bring recovery in areas devastated by the events of the past year and to assure that for all developing countries  inside and outside Africa  we do not put the Millennium Development Goals beyond reach as a result of a wider failure of global responsibility.  In London  the G-20 agreed on measures worth $50 billion for poor countries to help them weather the crisis. Because of London  the International Monetary Fund can lend $8 billion instead of $2 billion over this year and next. This is already helping Kenya and Tanzania to increase Government spending in response to the crisis.  Amid all these challenges  we must remember a fundamental promise we made 10 years ago. And this is my fifth and final imperative: to achieve a vision for 2015 that we are in danger of betraying  because on present trends it will not take five years — as we pledged — and not even 50 years; it will take more than 100 years to deliver on some of our Millennium Development Goals. And 100 years is too long for the peoples of our countries to wait for the justice that has been promised.   As President Obama has said  we need a global plan to make the Millennium Development Goals a reality. The unyielding  grinding  soul-destroying  so often lethal poverty I saw in Africa and other developing countries has convinced me that unless empowerment through trade justice is matched by empowerment through free education and free health care  then this generation in sub-Saharan Africa will not have the opportunity they deserve to rise out of poverty and will never be fully free.    09-52179 54   I believe the greatest of injustice demands the boldest of actions. Today at this United Nations General Assembly  we will see history being made with the beginnings of universal free health care in Africa and Asia as Burundi  Sierra Leone  Malawi  Nepal  Liberia and Ghana all make major announcements  which I applaud  that extend free health care and abolish user fees. As a result of those actions  more than 10 million additional people in Africa and Asia will now have access to free health services — 10 million people who will now for the first time get the treatment they need without being turned away or fearing how they will pay. I urge you all to match the leadership of these countries with your own support  and I commit the United Kingdom to giving that support.  Let us remember how in 1945  as the United Nations was being created  countries faced a multiplicity of challenges but summoned up the energy and vision not just to rebuild from the ruin and rubble of a war  but to establish a new international order for shared security and progress. I believe that these same principles must now inspire new and better  more representative and more effective ways of cooperating globally together.  And as we learn from the experience of turning common purpose into common action in this our shared global society  so we must forge a progressive multilateralism for this era  one that depends upon us finding within ourselves and together the qualities of moral courage and leadership that for our time and for our generation can make this world anew. I believe that if we take the right decisions and work together  we are in the business of creating for the first time in human history a truly global society. It is a name to be wished for and an aim to be fought for by all of us."
"63",2575,"GEO",64,2009,"I am grateful for the opportunity to address the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session.  Each year  we gather here to confront our common challenges and to express our vision for the world we share  the world for which we are common stewards. And each year we promise to do more and to do better to live up to and defend the principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter.  This year  we meet on the twentieth anniversary of the most successful triumph of those principles. Twenty years have passed since Europe and the rest of the world were liberated from one of the cruellest episodes in modern history. The fall of the Berlin Wall brought an end to an artificial line that separated nations  divided families  strangled freedom and imprisoned millions. Remarkably  that formidable wall crumbled without a single shot being fired. It yielded to the will of those millions who yearned for liberty and it yielded to the determination of a united West.  Twenty years ago  a universally feared military force was defeated by the force of a universal truth — the call for freedom and the simple desire to live a dignified life. When the Berlin Wall was dismantled 20 years ago  it did more than free the captive nations of the Warsaw Pact. It unleashed the hopes  dreams  aspirations and talents of millions of citizens living under the tyranny of the Soviet Union — including my own nation’s people.  Today  these citizens make up more than a dozen diverse nations  linked together by the common desires and ambitions to live in a world free from spheres of influence — free from external control — and to be able to choose their own destiny. Today  as we look back at that historic chapter and the impact it has had on our world  we can rightly be proud of what was achieved  the tremendous progress that has been made  and the prosperity that a lasting peace has brought.  But if we are to evaluate the past honestly  we must admit that the present remains bittersweet. For there is a real danger that  rather than build on this great chapter of idealism and progress  States and leaders will allow a return of the dull complacency and cynical power politics that led to so many of the worst moments of the past 100 years.  And the moment is bittersweet because  regrettably  not everyone drew the same lessons of hope and inspiration when that wall came down. Indeed  20 years ago  when freedom’s spirit swept that wall away  few imagined the repression and threats it represented would so soon reappear and that the hopes unleashed in 1989 would so quickly founder. Yet today  a Europe that is whole  free  and at peace remains a goal still to be achieved — a project not yet accomplished and a challenge  unfortunately  unmet.  Today  I stand before the Assembly as the democratically elected leader of a proud and sovereign nation. But  tragically  Georgia today  like Germany a generation ago  is a nation with a deep wound running through it. As Václav Havel and other leading voices  of Europe’s conscience declared earlier this week  Europe is today divided by a new wall built by an outside force — a wall that runs through the middle of Georgia.  This wall has been built by the same people who miss the Berlin Wall  who regret its fall  who did everything so that the wall would not fall. This wall cuts off one fifth of our territory and  once again  divides Europe from itself  creating new lines of repression and fear  artificial dividing lines inside the internationally recognized borders of a European nation.  It may be unpopular  but I am obliged to speak the truth. And the truth is that this wall’s existence mocks the progress we seemed to have made since that bright  shining day in Berlin 20 years ago. This new wall tells us that  once again  the rule of force has trumped the rule of law and the rule of reason.  I see no irony — only tragedy — in the fact that this wall is being built by the very people whose ideas were collectively and decisively defeated and rejected just 20 years ago. I take no comfort in the fact that   57 09-52425  those who thought the wall’s destruction was the single greatest tragedy of the twentieth century now lead these deplorable efforts.  One year ago  my country was invaded. Tanks  warplanes  warships  bombs and State-directed cyber-hackers descended upon our towns  villages  cities  infrastructure and economy. Hundreds of our people were killed within days and thousands were wounded. Tens of thousands of innocent civilians were forced to flee in the face of ethnic cleansing  which independent human rights organizations have documented very well.  Today  these acts of brutality have gone unaddressed  in direct contravention of international law  the norms of this institution and internationally signed agreements designed to reverse these wrongs. These are the facts that confront us as we gather here today  and these facts have a name: armed aggression  ethnic cleansing  mass violation of human rights and continuing illegal occupation.  Those who unleashed war in our region and in my country and led ethnic cleansing campaigns in Georgia said yesterday — in this very Hall  from this very rostrum — that they had to do it to “implement the principle of the indivisibility of security” in order to “move beyond the legacy of the past” (). This is la langue de bois — very classical langue de bois from the old days.  The only thing that they stepped over in reality was our sovereign border. They said they had to do it  just as their predecessors had to invade Poland — because of Poland’s reckless desire to be free — in 1939  Finland in 1940  Hungary in 1956  Czechoslovakia in 1968  and Afghanistan in 1979. The same people had to erase a capital of 400 000 inhabitants — Grozny — to destroy and exterminate the proud Chechen nation and kill tens of thousands of innocent women and children. And I am saying on the record that the clock is ticking  and they will have to do it again  and they will do it again unless they are stopped by all of us. Recent history indeed is a powerful guide to understanding what kind of actions these leaders undertake in order to bring what they call security and stability to my nation.  But I want to say clearly today that the people of Georgia cannot and will not accept a new dividing line in our country. That is an unchangeable commitment. Under these daily menaces  military provocations and all kinds of lies directed against us from many different sources  my nation will not crumble and we will never surrender to this brutal force.  The wall across Europe is not a matter of concern to Georgia alone. Indeed  in this matter the very values of this institution are under threat. The protection of human rights  respect for the dignity and equality of all persons  the inadmissibility of ethnic cleansing and the recognition of the inviolability of sovereign borders — all these are values that form the bedrock of this institution.   We certainly did not choose this course of action  but it is up to us to recognize and reverse its illegality. As a community of responsible nations  it is our collective responsibility to uphold international law and to insist that borders cannot and will not be changed through the use of force. It is up to us to tear down this new wall peacefully with the power of our ideas and the strength of our convictions. I want the world to understand clearly how we view this new wall and our strategy for tearing it down.  To start with  let me state outright that we do not expect it to disappear overnight. We understand that it is a very  very hard process  but the history of the Berlin Wall teaches us that patience must never be passive. We should never become resigned to the idea that this situation should be accepted or tolerated. The Berlin Wall fell only because passionate  disciplined  energetic partisans of freedom  both behind and outside that wall  worked with focus  discipline  courage and determination to remind the world community of the illegitimacy and illegality of that wall  and to take action to hasten its demise.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank those States Members of the United Nations for their votes recognizing the right of return for all who have been displaced and for all the victims of ethnic cleansing. I would like to thank all those nations across the globe that resisted illegal pressure — and in many cases attempts at bribery — by standing firm in their non-recognition of those territories of Georgia now occupied by a foreign force. I want to thank all those nations that have been so generous in pledging and providing the vital economic support that has proved invaluable in helping to build shelters for and rebuild the dreams of those the invasion has made refugees and internally displaced persons. On behalf of all my fellow citizens  I wish to thank them for their    09-52425 58  generosity  especially at a time of such extreme hardship around the world.  Beyond the comfort provided by their material support  I want to thank all of Georgia’s friends who have defended not only our sovereignty  but our right to forge our own path in the world  to choose our own alliances and to reject the nineteenth-century notion of spheres of influence  which led to so much warfare  repression and hardship in the world’s history. I want to thank those nations and leaders of the European Union who today have committed their monitors to Georgia for the promotion of peace. The Georgian people are also grateful to United States President Obama for his unyielding words and very strong declarations of support for our sovereignty and territorial integrity  as well as to Vice President Biden for visiting Georgia this summer and for underscoring  in meeting with refugee children  America’s commitment to our democracy and our right to choose our own future. In particular  I want to thank the United Nations for more than 16 years of contributions to peace on the ground in Georgia through its presence in our country — a presence recently and abruptly halted by the unilateral actions of one single Member State.  Our future depends on us  and so today I also want to report to the United Nations on the progress Georgia has made  through our own efforts  in the year since we suffered Europe’s first invasion in the post-cold war era. One year after losing hundreds of our sons and daughters and after seeing hundreds of thousands of our people displaced  the Georgian people have regrouped and made real progress down the path of peace  freedom and individual liberty.  I would like to pay tribute to their courage. Just a few days ago  in a refugee camp outside Tbilisi  I saw young children demonstrating their unstoppable will to have a normal and free life. These were children of all ethnic backgrounds. Indeed  most of the refugees from South Ossetia are ethnic Ossetians  and they fled from so-called liberators or were forced out. The children I saw in that refugee camp were seizing the opportunity to learn how to compete in the modern age using new computers  mastering English and advancing their pursuit of knowledge  despite the odds. These children are the future of my country. These children symbolize the path Georgia took after the invasion.  We are following through on the promises I made at this rostrum last year to strengthen our democracy  foster pluralism and expand individual liberties. Already  we have set reforms in motion that within the next year will advance the progress of the Rose Revolution and irreversibly deepen our identity as the freest State in our region. Already  we have permitted nearly three months of opposition protests to proceed unhindered  even though they closed down the main streets of our capital and paralysed Government buildings. Our actions reflect our deep commitment to pluralism and our respect for dissent and freedom of speech.   In a situation where enemy troops are just two dozen kilometres from the capital  with their artillery pointed at the city centre  we have already given opposition-controlled broadcast stations license to transmit across the nation. Already  we have brought opposition parties into the meetings of our national security council  basically keeping no secrets from them and giving full access to all State information  so as to ensure that our security policies reflect the unified will of the nation  beyond faction and beyond party. Already  we have committed to the direct election of all mayors in a few months’ time  and we have begun the development of new electoral rules  based on consensus and the agreement of different political parties  in order to ensure the greatest possible legitimacy of the next local  parliamentary and presidential elections.  Along with all these efforts and our commitment to democratic reforms  our biggest imperative today is to continue to integrate all different political interests and groups in promoting a better everyday life for our citizens. We are also doing everything we can to rebuild our economy.  The Georgian people are skilled and hard-working  but they are enduring the double punishment of the global economic downturn and the economic consequences of last summer’s invasion. Our biggest imperative at home is to create more employment  and we are pursuing that goal every day. Indeed  we are heartened and proud that the World Bank recently ranked Georgia as the eleventh most attractive country in the world for doing business  when only a few years ago we ranked 122nd. We also rank first in Eastern and Central Europe  just one year after the invasion. And we will continue to take steps to strengthen our economy and create more employment.   59 09-52425   We are resolutely committed to our vision of a sovereign and unified Georgia. Together with all of Georgia’s diverse ethnic groups and religions  we will prevail over the illegal occupation and reverse the results of ethnic cleansing.  Abkhazia is the birthplace of Georgian civilization. Since the days of the ancient kingdom of Colchida — which was the birthplace of one of the most interesting and ancient European cultures  beginning with Jason and the Argonauts — it has been a valuable and vibrant part of our journey through history. Just a few years ago  it remained a very vibrant part of Georgia. And that most vibrant and successful part of Georgia has now been emptied of more than three quarters of its population. Gardens  hotels  theatres and restaurants have been replaced by military bases  minefields and graveyards. It will take time  but I am sure that Abkhazia will once again be what it was — the most wonderful part of Georgia — and that the occupation will be merely a part of history.   I came here today to deliver a simple message. We believe that Georgia is winning the peace  and here is how the Assembly can measure our commitment. Did we crumble in the face of the brutal invasion? No. Did we crack down on dissent? No. Did we reduce freedom in the face of recession? No. Even in the face of adversity  we continue to contribute to the common goals established by our friends and the international community at large.  I am proud to say that Georgia is in the vanguard of the battle against climate change  producing 85 per cent of its electricity from green and renewable sources. That percentage is growing  and within the next three years we will cover 100 per cent of our needs. Meanwhile  we are on the front lines in confronting terrorism throughout the world with our allies  including in Afghanistan  where our troops will serve side by side with others from around the world.  We are winning the peace because  every day  the nations of our region become more and more independent from our common imperial legacy. Every day  regional States increasingly reject the tremendous pressure generated by our common past. Every day  the idea that we can resist revanchist tendencies is spreading further  and every day the arc of independent nations — from Ukraine to Moldova and from Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan to Mongolia — is telling the world that spheres of influence are a thing of the past.   Georgia is not only a country; the new wall that cuts across our territory has transformed Georgia into an idea and a test. It is an idea of freedom and independence and a test for the world — a test that the world must not fail. If the world passes the test  then everyone will be amazed at how quickly the region will develop its tremendous potential. An active  patient victory over this new wall would be a crucial step in the effort to build energy security for free nations and a united front against lawlessness and terrorism. Georgia is a place where all cultures  influences  religions and traditions meet  providing an antidote to the threat of a clash of civilizations.  Yesterday  President Obama said clearly that new walls should not divide us  that the future belongs to those who build and not to those who destroy  and that cooperation and values must prevail against division and cynicism. Today  I want to stress how much we share that vision and how vital that vision is to my country  my region and beyond.  Twenty years ago  the velvet revolutions opened a new era of international relations and a new journey began towards a free and cooperative world. I am confident that we will prevail on that journey  but only if we are not complacent or passive and only if we support and defend our deeply held values. After all  only this week  the clarion voice of those velvet revolutions two decades ago — the voice of Václav Havel — offered us a solemn reminder about the dangers that we have yet to overcome. Speaking about the new wall that now divides Georgia  he wrote  together with other prominent Europeans  that “the failure of western democracies to respond to the dismemberment of a friendly nation  albeit a small one  can have very serious global consequences … The European Union was built against the temptation of Munich and the iron curtain. It would be utterly disastrous if we were to appear in any way to condone the kind of practices that plunged our continent into war and division for most of the last century. At stake is nothing less than the fate of the project to which we continue to dedicate our lives: the peaceful and democratic reunification of the European continent”.    09-52425 60   We must not fail to hear Václav Havel’s call  President Obama’s call and the call of one of my personal heroes from Russia  Anna Politkovskaya  who was so brutally silenced. I remember my conversation with Ms. Politkovskaya just a few days before she was murdered. She was my friend and my hero  and I remember the hopes that she expressed. Their calls echo across two decades of progress — progress that has inspired the greatest hopes but that remains very fragile. Today and together  we must provide answers. Today and together  we must show leadership and vision. Today and together  we must demonstrate our   common resolve. And most of all  today and together  we must provide an example  showing that the power of our values and ideals will finally unleash the tremendous human potential within all of us."
"64",2622,"GHA",64,2009,"I bring very warm greetings from the people of Ghana. Allow me to join previous speakers in congratulating the President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session on his election. His long distinguished service to his country and to Africa gives us confidence that we are in experienced and capable hands. I also wish to express my delegation’s appreciation to his predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann  for the able manner in which he presided over the General Assembly at its sixty-third session.   Last Monday  21 September  Ghana celebrated the centenary of the birth of an illustrious son of Ghana and of Africa  our first President  Mr. Kwame   09-52320 4  Nkrumah  under whose leadership Ghana became a Member of the United Nations on 8 March 1957  only two days after achieving independence. We recall Mr. Nkrumah’s declaration before the General Assembly on 23 September 1960 that the United Nations was the only organization to hold out any hope for the future of mankind. At the same session  he called for the reform of the Security Council in order to bring it in line with a rapidly changing world. Those views were expressed almost 50 years ago  but they remain relevant.   Then  as now  Africa faced a deep crisis  with profound and far-reaching implications for international peace and stability. Today  the combined effects of climate change  high food and energy prices and the current financial and economic crisis threaten to erode the modest but hard-earned economic growth and democratic achievements of the past two decades. Africa remains volatile  and violent conflicts still persist. Therefore  it is my humble proposal that we all support the United Nations and its regional allies  such as the African Union  in living up to those and to the other pressing challenges facing the international community.   While we acknowledge that globalization has expanded and accelerated economic interdependence among States  the truth is that the benefits for many developing countries have been negligible. Indeed  the economies of many developing countries have not been transformed in any significant manner. Despite almost a decade of impressive growth of about 5 per cent  only a few countries have been able to reduce the proportion of their population living on less than $1 per day. Consequently  most of those countries remain vulnerable to the various external shocks that continue to pose threats to their growth.  In fact  over-reliance on high commodity prices and mineral exports has not lessened  but rather exposed structural impediments to food security. That is particularly true of sub-Saharan Africa  where the ongoing world financial and economic crisis threatens to erode decades of modest growth  and thereby make the Millennium Development Goals unattainable in any meaningful way.   Ghana  therefore  reiterates its support for global integration that ensures inclusive and equitable development and also leads to a substantial reduction in poverty  including full and productive employment and broad access to social services.  A number of developing countries have adopted various measures to mitigate the impact of the crisis on their economies  including interest rate reductions  recapitalization of financial institutions  trading reforms  and increased liquidity to banks. Ghana has also exercised fiscal restraint in response to the crisis  by cutting out all low-priority public spending and shifting the balance from recurrent expenditure to infrastructure investment.  In addressing the impact of the crisis on their economies  African countries would like to see the following: rich countries making a greater effort to meet existing commitments on aid and debt reduction; the acceleration of disbursements and improved access to existing financial facilities; the International Monetary Fund (IMF) being urged to put in place a new facility with relaxed conditions to help African development during this crisis period; a capital increase for the African Development Bank to enable it to scale up its interventions in support of African development; the sale of IMF gold reserves to release more resources to help African development during this period; and finally  the issuance of new Special Drawing Rights.  International trade carries enormous potential for poverty reduction and alleviation as well as for driving economic growth so that millions of our people can be lifted out of the quagmire of poverty. The ongoing Doha Round of trade talks promises  at least in principle  to improve market access for poor countries. This commitment  in our view  is very important  especially in low-skill and labour-intensive sectors such as garment manufacturing  from where most African exports come.  Sustained economic growth requires that poor countries increase their exports to rich countries. Unfortunately  the current system of trade discriminates against poor countries  hinders their participation in the global economy and damages the earning potential and opportunities of rural communities in those countries.  These developments do not work in the interest of our developing countries. Indeed  trade-distorting subsidies  as well as tariff and non-tariff barriers instituted by most advanced countries  discriminate against African products. Developing countries    5 09-52320  including Ghana  though we accept that liberalization is  indeed  required  believe that liberalization must be accompanied by predictable access to markets  elimination of the abuse of anti-dumping measures as well as the reduction of tariffs and non-tariff barriers.  In the face of all these developments  we in Africa acknowledge and recognize that all our efforts to achieve social and economic development will not yield much result unless we demonstrate our commitment to good governance. In spite of the difficulties and challenges  I can say without fear of contradiction that  leaders across the continent have embraced democratic values  except in a few cases where narrow self-interests are threatening the commendable gains that we have made in the past decade.  We are also confronted with the grave risks to environmental  social and economic development posed by climate change. The need for concrete  timely and decisive measures to enable us to deal with this largely man-made problem is obvious  and meeting that need must not be deferred any longer.  As we proceed to the United Nations Climate Change Conference scheduled for December 2009 in Copenhagen  the issue of financing mitigation and adaptation to climate change in developing countries will remain central to the deliberations. In fact  progress on these issues will be crucial in determining any outcome in Copenhagen.  The intrinsic link between security and development has been generally recognized by the international community. Despite the pivotal role played by the United Nations in identifying the threats confronting the international community and marshalling the necessary international support to deal with those challenges  humanity’s hope and aspiration for a peaceful and prosperous world are weakened by a litany of unfulfilled promises and failures.  Rather than being discouraged by these shortcomings  we in Ghana are unwavering in our conviction that  though daunting  the challenge to the community of nations could be surmounted through innovative  bold  and achievable measures.  Peacekeeping operations have played a pivotal role in the Organization’s efforts to fulfil its core mission of maintaining international peace and security. Ghana  as one of the oldest and most consistent troop-contributing countries  deems it a matter of privilege and honour to be associated with this success story of our Organization. We equally acknowledge that increasing demands have placed further strain on an overstretched system.  It is for this reason that we applaud and renew our support for the reform process that is in place and also acknowledge the fruitful dividends that have come out of it  even though we admit that much more needs to be done if we are to achieve our objectives.   Ghana cannot but commend the growing cooperation between the United Nations and regional organizations. We call for its intensification to enable it to take advantage of the cooperative strength of the United Nations and regional organizations in a mutually complementary manner.  Next year marks the fifteenth year since the adoption  at the Fourth World Conference on Women  of the 1995 Beijing Platform for Action. In view of the huge gap between policy and practice and the unyielding progress in implementing that international convention on gender equality and the empowerment of women  it is our suggestion that we need to take a coherent  integrated and multisectoral approach to this problem.  Over the years  Ghana has demonstrated its commitment to implementing in an accelerated manner the goals of the Beijing Platform for Action  and we have done so by adopting concrete administrative  legal and constitutional means. Our efforts have yielded some measure of success  as clearly testified to by the appointment of our first female speaker of parliament  the first female attorney-general  and quite a number of female ministers and deputy ministers.   At its sixty-third session  the General Assembly adopted resolution 63/194  urging us to improve our efforts and join the international initiative against human trafficking and for the protection of victims. We in Ghana concur with those who view the elaboration and adoption of a United Nations global plan of action as an effective and practical way to give life and effect to the international initiative against this despicable crime. It is our expectation that the President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session will make this an urgent and priority issue. I can assure him of Ghana’s commitment and support.   09-52320 6   In conclusion  I note with regret that conflicts  particularly in the developing world  have robbed us of an opportunity to improve the circumstances of our peoples. Indeed  it is well known that sustainable development can only be achieved in an international environment characterized by peace and stability.  We in Ghana therefore want to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to the ideals of the United Nations and to fulfil our Charter obligations by joining together with other Member States to assist the United Nations in playing its role in the maintenance of international peace and stability and in the promotion of fruitful international cooperation. We are convinced that the United Nations remains the ideal multilateral instrument for achieving international peace and security and promoting fruitful international cooperation. I would therefore want all of us to strengthen our resolve and muster the necessary political will to assist the United Nations to more effectively discharge its obligation to redeem our peoples from war  disease and poverty.  We in Ghana have pledged to build a better Ghana. We therefore want to assist the United Nations to build a better world. May God bless us in all these efforts."
"65",2668,"GIN",64,2009,"At the outset  on behalf of the Guinean delegation  which I have the honour of leading  I would like to pass on to the President  Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki  Secretary of African Union Affairs of the Great Socialist People’s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya  the congratulations of the Guinean people and Government on his brilliant election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. I would also like to convey the    09-52604 20  congratulations of Captain Moussa Dadis Camara  President of the Republic  Head of State  President of the National Council for Democracy and Development and Commander-in-Chief of the Guinean armed forces.  My delegation is convinced that because Mr. Treki is a seasoned diplomat  our work will be crowned with success. We assure him of our full cooperation. I would also like to tell his predecessor  Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann  how much my delegation appreciates his wisdom and the devotion with which he led the work of the Assembly at its sixty-third session. The Republic of Guinea salutes the remarkable work that Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has accomplished at the helm of our Organization in favour of peace  development and prosperity in the world.  Mrs. Gallardo Hernández (El Salvador)  Vice-President  took the Chair.  On 23 December 2008  all the people of Guinea enthusiastically welcomed the arrival of the National Council for Democracy and Development  the CNDD. Guinean armed forces decided to take the destiny of the country into their hands after the death of President Lansana Conté on 22 December 2008 in order to avoid the social implosion that would have damaged peace  security  stability  unity and harmonious development in the country.  Poor political and economic governance and its related effects of corruption  impunity  the consumption of and trafficking in drugs  the proliferation of small arms and light weapons  organized crime and the abdication of republican institutions had considerably weakened the authority of the State. The National Council for Democracy and Development  faithful to its commitments  has undertaken specific actions  the results of which are encouraging.  Such actions include  inter alia  the preparation of a timetable for transition  designed and accepted by all parties involved on the basis of a participatory and inclusive dialogue  which should lead to democratic  free and transparent elections with a view to returning to constitutional order. There is also the fight against drugs and narcotics  against the embezzlement of public funds  organized crime and other social ills. Additionally  there will be a special programme to meet the basic needs of the population  including water and electricity  as well as the beginning of reform of the security and defence sectors.  In this context  the National Council for Democracy and Development enjoys a close working relationship with national stakeholders. This synergy of activities has allowed for the establishment of an ad hoc committee that has evaluated and revised the transition timetable. Following the new timetable  the presidential elections will be held in January 2010 and the legislative elections in March of that year. In parallel  a relationship of trust and cooperation has been established with the International Contact Group on Guinea  whose mission is to accompany this process of transition.  The CNDD and the Government attach particular importance to the fight against drugs and narcotics in our country  which  unfortunately  in recent years has become one of the hubs of this trade in West Africa. The recent discovery of toxic substances and underground laboratories in certain towns of our country illustrates the seriousness of the situation. The bold operations undertaken by the new authorities have led to arrests within the highest echelons of the security and defence forces and the civil service.  The Republic of Guinea is seeking the support of the international community in this stabilization effort. We call for the application of the Political Declaration and Plan of Action on International Cooperation towards an Integrated and Balanced Strategy to Counter the World Drug Problem adopted by the Commission on Narcotic Drugs at its fifty-second session  held in Vienna in March 2009.  The Guinean Government has also carried out activities to bring ethical management to the handling of public finances. In this area  audits have revealed many cases of financial misappropriation at high levels within the State. The funds recovered so far have been used to partially finance the programme to provide water and electricity for all  launched by the CNDD to improve the living conditions of the population. My delegation renews its call to development partners for increased material  financial and technical support during the period of transition in Guinea.  On behalf of the CNDD and the President of the Republic  His Excellency Captain Moussa Dadis Camara  the Guinean Government expresses its profound gratitude to all those who support its efforts in the framework of a peaceful  consensual and   21 09-52604  successful transition. The Guinean authorities wish to thank all those who have shown their goodwill  in particular the leader of the Libyan Revolution and His Majesty the King of Morocco  as well as Their Excellencies the Presidents of Senegal  Côte d’Ivoire  Burkina Faso  Liberia  Sierra Leone and Mali  for everything they have done in favour of unity  reconciliation and stability in Guinea. The Guinean authorities also express their thanks to all leaders from Africa and elsewhere who have been prepared to provide various kinds of help to ensure the historic and exemplary success of the transition process in our country.  The agenda of the Assembly’s present session includes several recurrent questions  real challenges to the construction of a new world order founded on justice  solidarity and sustainable development. Realizing these aspirations remains dependent on the international community fulfilling its commitments to developing countries  which are bearing the brunt of the global economic and financial crisis. This is yet more necessary because  despite the progress that has been made in the fight against pandemics  illiteracy and extreme poverty  immense efforts are still needed for the full and harmonious achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.  Therefore  the establishment of a partnership that prioritizes the development of Africa through substantial increases in aid and investment flows is clearly indispensable. The question of foreign debt  which seriously compromises our efforts to eradicate poverty  merits particular attention. Furthermore  the low prices we receive for basic commodities  together with the unpredictability of nature  the harmful effects of human activity on the environment and climate change  all contribute to rendering African economies fragile and lead to precarious agricultural and food production.  With regard to peace and security  significant progress has been made in the prevention and resolution of conflicts. However  areas of tension still exist here and there  with the associated loss of human life  unspeakable suffering  destruction of property and flows of refugees and displaced persons.  In Africa  the peace and reconciliation process at the national level is making progress  thanks to concerted actions on the part of the African Union and subregional organizations  supported by the international community  despite human rights violations and bad economic and political governance. In the Mano River basin  the success of the vigorous peacebuilding measures in Sierra Leone and Liberia gives us cause for comfort and hope. Through the implementation of the Ouagadougou Political Agreement  Côte d’Ivoire is consolidating its reunification and is in the process of organizing free elections. The Republic of Guinea supports this process.  Elsewhere on the continent  the successful holding of presidential elections in Guinea-Bissau and Mauritania augurs well for a new era  conducive to national reconciliation  peace  stability and progress. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo  the United Nations  the African Union and neighbouring countries are engaged in a dialogue that will without a doubt lead to the re-establishment of peace in the east of the country  which is a yardstick for stability  security and development in the Great Lakes region.   With regard to Somalia and the situation in Darfur  the international community must step up its efforts alongside the African Union in order to bring about a rapid and durable political solution.  Regarding the Western Sahara  while we welcome the efforts of the Secretary-General and his Special Envoy  my country welcomes the Moroccan initiative for the negotiation of an autonomous status for the Sahara region. We urge the parties concerned to find a mutually acceptable political outcome to this dispute.  With regard to the Middle East  Guinea remains convinced that solving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict necessarily requires a comprehensive solution  leading to the creation of an independent  sovereign and viable Palestinian State living side by side and in peace with Israel within secure and internationally recognized borders  in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the Security Council and the road map of the Quartet. The international community has a duty to ensure that this comes about.  In Asia  Guinea reaffirms its commitment to the principle of one China and to the peaceful reunification of the Korean peninsula.  Terrorist acts are proliferating throughout the world  indiscriminately affecting innocent victims  including women  children and the elderly. Those forms of barbarism and intolerance must be condemned in no uncertain terms. My delegation welcomes the    09-52604 22  adoption by the United Nations of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. We remain in favour of developing a comprehensive international convention against terrorism and hope that consultations on this issue will continue in a spirit of full cooperation.   My country continues to pay great attention to international efforts in the area of disarmament and weapons control. We express our support for the banning and total destruction of nuclear  biological and chemical weapons  as well as the eradication of the trade in fissile materials. In Africa  the illicit and uncontrolled circulation of small arms and light weapons is a source of instability for States and of insecurity for the population. The Economic Community of West African States has adopted a convention on this issue with the objective of establishing a climate of peace through a framework for cooperation between member States for the systematic control and elimination of these weapons  which fuel civil wars. The success of this programme requires the commitment of all member States and the support of bilateral and multilateral partners.  The world finds itself facing a grave and unprecedented financial and economic crisis. Africa has not been spared the contagious effects of this crisis. The report of the Secretary-General details how our continent has seen setbacks in such crucial areas as economic growth  agricultural development  the eradication of poverty and the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals.  The time has come to rethink the international financial architecture in order to adapt it to the realities of the twenty-first century in terms of its representation of Member States and its working methods  as well as the equitable distribution of resources.  Innovative initiatives are essential in the areas of trade  official development assistance  debt alleviation  technology transfer and financing for developing countries in general and least developed countries in particular to enable them to benefit as much as possible from globalization. In that context  the commitments made at Monterrey  Johannesburg  Doha  London and Pittsburgh within the framework of the Group of 20 are grounds for hope. It is important that the Doha Round negotiations swiftly lead to an agreement on measures to promote development and put an end to abject poverty.  My country attaches the greatest importance to increasing and improving official development assistance and making it more predictable and more aligned with national priorities  in accordance with the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness.   Guinea welcomes the progress made in implementing the Highly Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative. Given the debt burden  we urge donors to work to strengthen resources and national and international capacities to support the strategies put in place to make the requirements for reaching its completion point more flexible.  The international community must fully support the implementation of the New Partnership for Africa’s Development  which commits the continent to developing infrastructure and promoting human rights  the rule of law  democracy and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.  The problems related to climate change have drawn the attention of all States because of the threat that phenomenon poses to humanity. Guinea  which occupies a central place in the implementation of policies and strategies for sustainable development and the restoration of ecological balances in West Africa  is aware of the seriousness of the situation and the urgent need for action. My delegation strongly calls for concerted and courageous international action to put an end to the paradox wherein countries and populations that have contributed least to global warming are suffering its most serious consequences. We hope that the forthcoming Copenhagen summit will meet the great expectations of humanity.   In addition  particular attention must be accorded the problems related to migratory flows and the many issues underlying them. It is only by promoting effective solidarity that we will be able to manage migratory flows.  Today’s world is beset by swift  complex and profound changes. Peace  development and the interdependence of nations remain undeniable realities and factors essential for a prosperous world of solidarity. Therefore  multilateralism is the only viable alternative for addressing the global challenges facing humanity. My delegation remains convinced that the present session will further strengthen the role and the activities of our universal Organization in the defence of just causes."
"66",2707,"GMB",64,2009,"I would like first of all to thank almighty Allah for granting us yet another opportunity for a gathering of world leaders. My delegation would like to thank President Obama  the Government and people of the United States of America  and the leadership of the United Nations for their warm welcome and the facilities placed at our disposal since our arrival.  Permit me also to congratulate Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann on his inspiring leadership and on conducting the affairs of the sixty-third session so well. By the same token  I extend warm felicitations to Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at this important sixty-fourth session. He has the full support of my delegation. Our special thanks go to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his stewardship and the commitment he has shown to the welfare of humanity  particularly of Africa.  “Effective responses to global crises: strengthening multilateralism and dialogue among civilizations for international peace  security and development”  the theme adopted for this year’s session  is indeed apt and relevant. It calls on every nation  big or small  to adopt multilateralism and dialogue in fostering international partnership on all matters of common concern surrounding global peace and development.  The complexities of today’s world are such that no nation can successfully confront them alone. Some issues cannot even be resolved by regional groups acting independently. Much can be achieved only when we all collaborate and work together within the framework of multilateralism based on mutual understanding  respect and  above all  sincerity  strong commitment and universal justice under the same rule of law and equity.  Our global body  the United Nations  has indeed adopted countless resolutions  which  if implemented to the letter  would have made this world a better place for all humankind and indeed other creatures on our planet. Unfortunately  there are some Member States that block well-meaning resolutions necessary for the maintenance of world peace and even question or disregard with impunity resolutions adopted by this body.   As long as this continues to be the order of the day  the United Nations will remain united in name only  unable to achieve in full the fundamental objectives for which it was established. The modus operandi of the Organization therefore needs urgent reforms to ensure that such impunity is eliminated and that the principle of equality among nation States  irrespective of their geopolitical size  location  economic circumstances  race or religion is safeguarded. Double standards have no place in the United Nations.  There cannot be peace and security in the absence of justice for all. There cannot be justice in the face of abject poverty characterized by hunger  starvation  disease and a lack of basic social services as a result of exploitation. There cannot be justice if there is merciless exploitation  suppression and criminal invasion of sovereign States. There cannot be peace if there is no development as a result of marginalization  injustice and racism. Unfortunately  injustice  racism  merciless exploitation and marginalization  especially as inflicted on developing nations by developed nations  are the order of the day.  Africa and Africans are the poorest of the poor  despite the fact that the African continent is the world’s richest in terms of mineral and other natural resources. The sad truth is that  despite the fact that the African continent is the source of 90 per cent of the precious minerals  gemstones and strategic raw materials for the industrialized North  we Africans are the poorest of the poor.  It is no fault of ours if we Africans are poor today. This situation has been brought about by the perennial invasions of the locusts and their permanent presence in Africa. They devour 90 per cent of our useful resources  from agricultural and mineral to flora    09-52425 28  and fauna. These locusts are present in all resource-rich African countries today. This devastating permanent invasion is exacerbated by another destructive phenomenon — the permanent drought that affects all African countries without exception. We cannot do anything about these two deadly scourges of the African continent. In the case of the locusts  they are protected by a one-sided international treaty imposed on all third-world countries  not only Africa. As for the drought  it is even worse  since no irrigation system in Africa can eradicate it.  The locusts I am talking about are the multinational Western companies that exploit our natural resources and agricultural produce  taking 95 per cent of their financial value and leaving us  the owners of the resources  with 5 per cent or less at most. Is it not interesting that  with respect to the mining of African mineral resources  only four African countries receive more than a 3 per cent royalty from these multinational mining companies? The rest receive only a 3 per cent royalty or even less. In the case of petroleum exploitation  few African countries receive above a 15 per cent royalty.  There is nothing African countries can do about this because these locusts have an absolute monopoly of the technologies used in the extractive industries. The treaty that makes it impossible for us to do anything about it is called globalization  which means the exploitation of poor third-world countries’ resources by the rich first-world countries. With regards to the drought — that is  the debt burden — very few rich countries have cancelled the debt owed them by third-world countries. This excruciating burden of debt consumes 80 per cent of the 3 to 5 per cent left by the multinational companies.  Our agricultural produce  such as tea  coffee and cocoa  is bought at prices fixed by the buyers  in most cases at an average price of less than $1 per kilo. The same produce is then sold at more than $15 per kilo when processed. Thus  for every kilogram of our agricultural produce worth $15 on the Western market  we get only $1. How can Africa develop and emerge from this abject poverty?  African resources have been looted continuously from the eleventh century to date. Everything in Africa that the locusts set their eyes on is looted even today. Even dead bodies have not been spared by the locusts. Graves were and are being desecrated and human bodies called mummies have been stolen from Africa. In such a situation  where even Africans in their graves are not spared by these rampaging locusts  who in his right mind could expect us in Africa to develop and become rich? In Africa  “R.I.P.” on a tombstone  which normally means “Rest In Peace”  has never been respected. “R.I.P.” really means “Respected If Poor” — that is  the body in the tomb will rest only if it was not buried with any precious jewellery.  The United Nations must come to the rescue of Africa. Otherwise  we Africans stand ready to liberate ourselves from this eternal bondage at any cost. From now on  the African Union will work towards ensuring that African nations and our farmers receive their rightful share of our God-given natural and agricultural resources. We will no longer accept less than 65 per cent of the proceeds from our natural resources.  We Africans have been suffering for too long at the hands of Westerners and we will put an end to this. It is African sweat  blood  tears and natural resources that have built the North throughout almost five centuries of merciless and racist exploitation that continues today. Enough is enough. Instead of being respected  we are being called all sorts of names and given all sorts of unsolicited titles — dictators  corrupt leaders  failed States and even rogue States.   We  the new generation of African leaders  will seek to put an end to this humiliating  degrading and racist treatment by any means necessary. The world will not live in peace and security as long as this dehumanizing and racist status quo continues to prevail with regard to the continent of Africa and to Africans. We have been forced to endure this for far too long and now we are going to put an end to it  as we have ended apartheid in South Africa  by force if necessary. We will defend our humanity  our dignity  our resources  our interests and our culture from this moment forward.  HIV/AIDS  malaria and tuberculosis are killer diseases. While I would like to reiterate my delegation’s support for the work of the Global Fund in fighting these diseases  I wish to call for concerted efforts to mobilize resources to support international research on traditional medicine and alternative disease treatment programmes. These traditional systems are in most instances more cost-effective  yet they have been abandoned due to the sort of criticism that come from multinationals threatened that certain traditional   29 09-52425  breakthroughs would be detrimental to their corporate existence and interests. These multinationals value their monetary gains more than human life. They should not be allowed to hold humanity to ransom. Their insatiable appetite for massive wealth at any cost has pushed them to the point of blindness  insensitivity to human suffering and the loss of human life in the developing world  especially in Africa.  With regard to international peace and security  my delegation calls once again for stronger and more honest international cooperation and dialogue in addressing conflict prevention  the peaceful resolution of disputes and respect for the cultural values  norms and ways of life of others. We must respect the fact that humanity was created to be diverse  just as planet Earth has different regions  each with its own diverse climatic and ecological system. Therefore  there is bound to be diversity in the colour of our skin  diversity in the way we live and differences in our beliefs. Diverse as we may be  we are part and parcel of the one human family created by the one and only God  Allah. If we accept the principle that we are all human beings equal before the only God that created us  and that differences in religion and skin colour do not make one person less human than another  then we will all live in perfect peace and harmony in this global village called the world.  The problem is that some play God and believe that  by virtue of the colour of their skin  they are better than the rest of humanity and therefore should dictate to them how they should live and how they should worship God. They impose their value systems on the rest of humanity. This unacceptable dictatorship is the source of all the world’s major conflicts and a contributing factor to persistent threats to world peace.  Racism is on the rise. Extremist hate-mongers are increasing in number and rising in rank. Instead of being condemned as criminals and terrorists  they are labelled the far right  neo-Nazis or supremacists  and tolerated and even encouraged by the same Powers that would happily bomb them back to the Stone Age if they were Muslim  black African or Asian. As long as this status quo persists  peace and security will continue to be an elusive dream as people  rich or poor  Muslim or non-Muslim  black or Asian  are bound to defend their human dignity at any price.  My delegation therefore calls for a united front against this dictatorship of a few over the rest of humanity. And in the interest of our collective security  the United Nations should see to the total elimination of racism and hatred in all their forms  whatever it takes  so that we can bequeath to the generations of humanity yet unborn a very peaceful and prosperous world devoid of destitution  exploitation and marginalization.  In this context  my delegation would like to see a speedy resolution of the plight of the Palestinians. We call on the State of Israel to accept and respect the two-State solution that the international community has so clearly articulated without preconditions. We also urge the Security Council to ensure that its resolutions are respected by all States and enforced to the letter and spirit by the United Nations  and not to allow certain States to choose not only to ignore these resolutions  but to violate them with impunity  while other States face drastic and devastating military action if such resolutions are adopted against them and they so much as ask for clarification.  The State of Israel has ignored and violated all United Nations resolutions and conventions with regard to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict  not only with impunity  but also with the support and protection of certain world Powers  while other countries have paid a very high price merely for not having fully complied with a Security Council resolution. The Council should stop employing these unfortunate double standards. The United Nations must not be turned into an “animal farm”.  Secondly  there is also the lingering issue of the Republic of China on Taiwan. My delegation holds the position that Taiwan should be invited to participate in all meetings and activities of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the International Civil Aviation Organization  among other bodies. Taiwan has a legitimate right to full membership of all United Nations specialized agencies  since even non-governmental organizations have either full membership or observer status in those agencies. Taiwan  a democratic State with a population of 23 million  is still being denied this fundamental human right  which the United Nations is supposed to uphold and protect in the first place.   My delegation also hereby calls on the United Nations to urge the United States of America to immediately and unconditionally lift its embargo on Cuba  in accordance with the wishes of more than    09-52425 30  98 per cent of the membership of this body. That trade embargo continues to hurt Cuban women and children. The Cuban children born into those extreme hardships have committed no crime. The punishment of women and children because of political differences is a very serious violation of their rights.  Thirdly  my delegation renews its full support for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the Kingdom of Morocco. On the question of the Moroccan Sahara  we remain convinced that the proposal of the Moroccan Government to grant substantive autonomy to the Saharan region on the basis of the negotiations initiated by the Security Council and conducted and agreed by the parties would lead to a lasting and peaceful resolution of the conflict.  Finally  my delegation has been following keenly  but with deep dismay  the protracted negotiations on reform of the Security Council and a seeming connivance to prevent such reform. Africa would like to see Council reform undertaken  with balanced representation of all continents in the Council. My delegation therefore urges the President of the General Assembly to make more effort on the issue during the sixty-fourth session and to ensure that the continent of Africa has at least two permanent seats on the Security Council with full veto powers; if it does not  any resolution adopted by the Council will not be binding on Africa or any African Union member State by the end of 2010. Africa  a continent 10 times the size of Europe  does not have a single permanent seat on the Security Council  while Europe has more than one.  Africa has been subjected to discrimination  marginalization  exploitation and humiliation for a very long time. We Africans are no longer going to accept that status quo. We will put an end to it very soon. Members should take my words seriously. "
"67",2747,"GNB",64,2009,"My first words are to congratulate Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. Aware of his skill and his vast diplomatic experience  we are convinced that this session will be crowned with success. My country  Guinea-Bissau  which has excellent relations of friendship and cooperation with his country  Libya  welcomes his election and assures him of our fraternal cooperation during his term.  I wish to congratulate and express the appreciation of Guinea-Bissau to Father Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann for his performance and his dedication to the successful conduct of the work of the    09-52592 8  sixty-third session. I should also like to thank the Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon  for his comprehensive report on the work of our Organization and the excellent work he has done to ensure the consolidation of peace and development throughout the world. In particular  I should like to congratulate Mr. Treki for holding the high-level gathering on climate change on 22 September as a prelude to the Copenhagen conference to be held in December.  Six months after the crisis caused by the assassination of our President  we have restored constitutional normality  and the organs of State power are in a position to fulfil the role entrusted to them by our Constitution. We have just inaugurated a new President  His Excellency Mr. Malam Bacai Sanhá  who was democratically elected in elections deemed free  fair and transparent by all political parties and candidates and by international observers.  The party that I have the honour to chair  the African Party for the Independence of Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde  has a qualified majority in parliament and in an inclusive Government  and now the President of the Republic is from among its ranks. Never in its history has our country enjoyed such great conditions for stability. We have thus created the conditions for implementing the reforms that the country so pressingly needs  in particular  reform of the public administration  with particular emphasis on the defence and security sectors  as well as public finance reform and the decentralization and modernization of the State apparatus.  In this regard  I would like to highlight the role and contribution of subregional organizations  such as the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)  the West African Economic and Monetary Union and the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries (CPLP)  as well as of the African Union and the United Nations  whose constant support has allowed our Government to make substantive progress in the normalization of the country’s political  economic and social life and development. I should like further to highlight the substantial support provided by the European Union during the difficult period we have gone through. In addition  I should like to thank the brothers of the CPLP countries for their continued commitment and solidarity.  The latest crisis situation in Guinea-Bissau resulted in the assassinations of the head of State and the Chief of Staff of the Guinean Armed Forces. Those tragic events surprised and shocked all of Guinean society and the international community. They revealed the vulnerabilities of our rule of law and the weaknesses of the national defence and security system.  In addition to strongly condemning those crimes  the Government immediately ordered the establishment of a committee to enable us to find out the truth and hold the perpetrators accountable. Since then  owing to its concerns about the objectivity  transparency and speed of the process  our Government made a request to the Secretary-General that an international inquiry be carried out under the auspices of the United Nations. In response to that request and on the basis of Security Council resolutions  the Secretary-General urged the Government to continue its own investigation of those crimes  offering  however  to intervene with the African Union  ECOWAS and the CPLP to provide the technical  financial and other types of support that might be necessary. Following that response from the Secretary-General  the Government sent requests for support to those organizations but has not yet received a response. The Government is truly looking forward to any assistance that can be offered by the African Union  ECOWAS and the CPLP.  We want to take advantage of our presence in New York to engage with all those organizations to ensure that conditions that would give a new dynamic to the work of the Committee of Inquiry are established  and we consider the attainment of that objective an essential condition in order to ensure genuine justice and contribute to the consolidation of the democratic rule of law and the protection and promotion of human rights. We seize this opportunity  from this rostrum  to firmly and unequivocally reaffirm that we are against impunity. We will not be a party to it  nor give safe haven to any type of crime. So I can assure you that the Government of Guinea-Bissau will do everything in its power to create the conditions for the Committee to carry out its work in a peaceful  transparent and credible manner.  Those events caused a serious crisis in my country  which led to a radical change in the priorities of Government policy — specifically  it became necessary to hold presidential elections. However  despite the gravity of the situation  the response of our   9 09-52592  institutions was swift and positive. The President of the People’s National Assembly temporarily assumed the presidency of the Republic  as provided for in the Constitution  and a date was immediately set for the holding of early presidential elections  according to the covenant of understanding among the political parties.  The tenure of the interim president  which has recently ended  was marked by the promotion of a constructive and frank dialogue between civil society and political society  with a particular focus on clarifying the objectives of the defence and security sector reform  which is a crucial pillar for peace and stability in the country.   In Guinea-Bissau  the creation of the armed forces preceded the creation of the State itself  and the latter inherited a burden of complex problems in the aftermath of the armed struggle for national liberation. As in other countries with a similar past  the problems associated with this condition are not easy to overcome  especially when facing survival issues that plague all of society. Aware of these facts  the Government held a round table discussion in Praia  Cape Verde  last May to jointly evaluate the proposed reform programme for the defence and security sectors with the help of our development partners  the United Nations  ECOWAS and the CPLP. The continuation of the reform programme in the military and security forces  within which the establishment of a Special Pensions Fund is planned  specially designed to deal with these issues  can contribute to solving those problems once and for all.  My Government has just concluded a thorough assessment of our national poverty reduction strategy. The results of this evaluation allowed us to conclude that we must strengthen our action on all the axes that define the strategy. It also enabled us  after careful consideration  to determine that the greatest impediment to the development of our country lies in the energy sector. It was concluded that the top priority should be to develop an energy plan that solves this problem definitively. We would therefore like to use this forum to ask our development partners to carry out the interim review of our poverty reduction strategy and its respective programmes as soon as possible so that we can organize  together with our partners  a round table to address the need to strengthen the technical  economic and financial cooperation programmes with our country. This round table  which we would like to organize under the title of “Reconciliation and Development”  will take into account the new strategic direction advocated by the Security Council  with the transformation of the current United Nations presence in Guinea-Bissau into an integrated mission from January 2010.  I believe I am in a position to say that  by working selflessly within this framework and with the resources that we obtain  we will be better able to accomplish the Millennium Development Goals set by the United Nations  in particular with regard to the consolidation of peace and stability in our country.  We welcome with satisfaction and encourage the policy of President Obama towards Africa  as recently clarified during his visit to some African countries; it shows concern for the stability of our subregion and of the world at large  and devotes greater attention to the promotion of development. We also welcome with satisfaction the peace initiatives that are under way in the Middle East under his patronage  as well as the United States Administration’s policy towards Cuba; we hope that the embargo against Cuba will be lifted in the near future.  We have been asking our development partners for many years for a post-conflict programme for Guinea-Bissau. A country with such severe shortages as ours should not be abandoned to its fate  given the profound consequences of the political-military conflict of 1998-1999  which continue to affect all socio-economic sectors of Guinea-Bissau. Guinea-Bissau  which once possessed foreign currency reserves enough to provide for six months’ worth of imports and which paid regular wages to its State employees  can no longer honour its commitments because of the war.  I am therefore particularly pleased with the position of the African Development Bank  which  understanding the needs of a post-conflict country  turned an important part of the financial resources available to Guinea-Bissau into donations. Likewise  we welcome the recent decision by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to negotiate and conclude a post-conflict programme with our Government  which will soon be joining the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility  which will enhance cooperation with our key development partners. We hope this new and dynamic level of cooperation will enable us to benefit from the initiative for debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative.     09-52592 10   I should like publicly to express our appreciation to the heads of State of the West African Economic and Monetary Union  Angola  Nigeria  the Leader and Guide of the Great Socialist Libyan Arab Jamahiriya  as well as to the CPLP and the European Union  for their support in covering our budget deficit  which has greatly contributed to the climate of peace in which we now live. Moreover  we acknowledge the presence of South Africa  Brazil and India  which have been contributing significantly to mitigating food shortages in our country through the India  Brazil and South Africa programme.  I should like to assure the General Assembly that  in bearing our responsibility for the governance of Guinea-Bissau  we shall strive to continue to merit the trust and support that the international community has granted us. We will do everything possible to enable Guinea-Bissau to make strides towards development and the well-being of its people.  We are of the opinion that the people of Guinea-Bissau themselves should seek to resolve their internal problems  especially those arising from social  political and military issues. However  one has to recognize that the reasons for the recurrence of the cyclical issues in our country are not only domestic in nature. Factors such as transnational organized crime and drug trafficking  in particular  have contributed to exacerbating the situation in Guinea-Bissau.  By taking advantage of our shortcomings in sea and land border control and in our administration structures  which are weak in some regions  and by using sophisticated means  certain groups have introduced drugs into our country with the support received from influential people in the State apparatus.  My Government is committed to participating in all programmes and initiatives adopted in the subregion of West Africa to combat drug trafficking and organized crime  as we are convinced of the need to establish mechanisms for coordination and support to fight these scourges.  We are prepared to examine the possibility of the participation of foreign forces in our country in joint surveillance missions monitoring our land and maritime borders as well as our airspace  in order to eradicate organized crime and all forms of trafficking in drugs  weapons and people  from or through the territory of Guinea-Bissau.  I would like to state before this Assembly my commitment as Prime Minister and president of the historic party founded by Amilcar Cabral  the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde  to strive to put Guinea-Bissau on the path of peace  national reconciliation and development. We will respect all the commitments made by my Government  whether related to peacebuilding  policy dialogue  poverty reduction and the creation of conditions conducive to economic growth and well-being of the Guinean people.  I ask the international community and our development partners who believe in our determination to end the cycles of crises and the recurring conflicts in Guinea-Bissau to provide a new opportunity to our country for a true partnership in favour of sustainable development.  I want to thank all the friends and partners of Guinea-Bissau for their solidarity and support. I can assure the Assembly that we will spare no efforts and will not be deterred by any obstacles in consolidating peace and political stability  promoting national unity in Guinea-Bissau and creating better living conditions for the Guinean people.  I leave this podium with a very special expression of our gratitude to all those who have contributed to this normalization  with particular attention  if you will allow me  to all of the members of the Contact Group  the Ad Hoc Advisory Group on Guinea-Bissau  whose mandate was recently terminated  all members of the Security Council  as well as to the Secretary-General and his Representative in Guinea-Bissau.  However  the most sublime show of appreciation on our part would be to build a peaceful and prosperous Guinea-Bissau for all its children  which we will strive to do with all our might."
"68",2786,"GNQ",64,2009,"At the outset  allow me to congratulate Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki  Minister of African Union Affairs of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya  on his unanimous election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. We are convinced that  guided by his Government’s adherence to the principles of national independence and sovereignty  the primacy of the values of the human individual  the maintenance of international peace and security  and the economic development of all countries  and with his well-known diplomatic skills  he will contribute to the good management of the Assembly and to ensuring that the United Nations achieves the universal objectives of peace  stability and global development.  We also express our thanks to Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann  Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Nicaragua  for his outstanding work at    09-52228 28  the sixty-third session  at a time when the world was shaken by an acute financial and economic crisis the consequences of which have fomented instability and threatened peace in various regions of the world.  Mr. Singh Puri (India)  Vice-President  took the Chair.  Amid this climate of insecurity  the food and global energy crises  natural disasters and climate change that threaten the sustainability of the global ecology  the work of the Secretary-General  as the coordinator of the activities of our Organization  has been far from easy. We therefore commend Mr. Ban Ki-moon for his efforts to address those issues and offer him our full support and cooperation so that his actions can be implemented without delay.  In taking the floor to address this international forum  I wish first and foremost to express our gratitude for this renewed opportunity to share our thoughts  experience and common concerns for the modern world. It is timely indeed that the Secretary-General has dedicated the sixty-fourth session of the General Assembly to the topic of effective responses to the current global economic and financial crisis in order to analyse its causes and adopt policies and strategies that will enable States to mitigate the negative consequences of the crisis  which are having an increasingly debilitating impact on economically weak countries in particular.  Following the end of the cold war and the disappearance of the bipolar and antagonistic world that emerged from the Second World War  it became clear that a more globalized  united and integrated era had dawned among nations that would result in greater justice  solidarity and integration in international exchanges and relations. Mutual respect for cultural specificities remains the fundamental basis for international cooperation  an association of shared responsibilities  mutual respect and equitable mutual benefit. That has been the guiding ideal of the United Nations since its inception. Its efforts to create a world of peace  development and well-being for humankind have followed this aim for the sixty-plus years of its history.  Yet the gap between developed and developing countries has only widened  in spite of the numerous resolutions  decisions and recommendations that have been adopted to promote the equality of political  economic  social and cultural rights; the global development of humanity; the replacement of the old economic order with a new  more just and equitable system; the provision of financial assistance to the most vulnerable countries; the liberalization of global trade; and in spite of the many other measures  adopted at special summits.  Yet  despite all this  global achievement of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals has fallen short by  20 per cent. We can see that  unfortunately  egoism and the desire to dominate remain the driving force in international relations. Inevitably  without a multilateralism that respects the criterion of partnership based on mutual respect for shared responsibilities and reciprocal and equitable interests  the global political  economic and social balance is undermined. Inevitably  unless this partnership is based on respect for the cultural values of every nation  a new cold or hot war is bound to break out between poor countries and rich countries.  The Republic of Equatorial Guinea welcomes the timeliness of this debate  since in the middle of this unprecedented global crisis we can all redefine our positions on the subject of global development. Here  in New York in 2009  we must resolve these problems so that the current causes of a misery and conflictiveness driven by the wealthy countries to the detriment of the poor or economically fragile countries no longer justify this new and absurd bipolarization — when  despite everything  humankind has assimilated the supremacy of the values that make up the human individual.  What kind of morality is it when some States enjoy economic abundance  while others suffer in misery  marginalization and desolation?  Accordingly  the Republic of Equatorial Guinea calls for new global approaches that will enhance the capacity of developing countries to contribute politically and economically and will allow a coexistence that safeguards the political and economic interests of all countries.   We can no longer continue on the path that we are on. We can no longer continue on this irrational and irresponsible path. We must consider matters calmly in order to adopt positive attitudes that effectively support the original philosophy of the United Nations  a philosophy that conceived of a united world where human beings  regardless of race  culture or level of   29 09-52228  civilization  are recognized as human beings  in both the North and the South.   Thus  there can be no justification for theories of globalization of policies unless they respect the cultural plurality that characterizes the peoples of the world. There can be no discrimination or exclusion. Intercultural dialogue must strengthen this community of nations with a view to achieving a coexistence that is conducive to learning from one another for the mutual benefit of us all.  Equatorial Guinea conceives of its development as the outcome of coordinated action between national effort and international cooperation. We rule out discrimination of any kind for reasons of political  economic or cultural system in the case of any country or international organization  provided that the latter respects our country’s independence  national sovereignty and territorial integrity  the peace and free exercise of the sovereignty of the people  the right to the free utilization of our natural resources  the maintenance of friendly relations and cooperation for reciprocal benefit  and respect for the cultural values of the people.  Through its application of these principles  Equatorial Guinea enjoys excellent ties of friendship  cooperation and good neighbourliness with all countries in Central Africa. We accept economic cooperation with countries of all ideological beliefs  from the East to the West and from the North to the South. This is part of our contribution to global peace and balance.  As a result  our oil and other resources contribute not only to the development of our European partners  but also to that of Africa  America and Asia. This being said  we are constantly amazed by the conflictiveness  suspicion and envy that these oil resources arouse in a number of countries  these same resources that we have made freely available to the international community. We witnessed this first-hand when Equatorial Guinea was the victim of mercenary-led invasions  terrorist attacks and plans for political destabilization  whose clear aim was to gain illegal access to resources which belong solely to the people of Equatorial Guinea.  We wish to emphasize that Equatorial Guinea is a peaceful country without ambitions to acquire territory or engage in political hegemony and without policies designed to jeopardize peace or stability in other States and nations. We reaffirm our commitment to the principles of the United Nations Charter and the Charter of the African Union with regard to the maintenance of peaceful relations  the rejection of violence and the peaceful resolution of disputes through dialogue  mediation and  where necessary  recourse to international tribunals.  Global peace is the universal right of all and an indispensable prerequisite for the survival of humankind. It is non-negotiable  not to be traded with any public or private interest  and is so fragile that it can be shattered when injustices affecting a State or a community of States are committed. Therefore  we are addressing the situation caused by the global economic crisis  which  without a doubt  has had repercussions in individual States of the international community  each at different levels and each with the potential to affect global peace. We have witnessed examples of such consequences in the recent conflicts that have engulfed various States in the world today. Yet  this noble world Organization was created for peace.   It is for the sake of maintaining peace and world stability that we all meet here every year. It is also for the sake of peace and stability that we must be careful not to the let the attitudes of some countries or groups of countries foster  out of whatever ambitions or selfishness they have  continuing injustices that have created the crisis in international relations.  With best wishes for a world abundant in peace and happiness  I wish every success to this sixty-fourth session of the General Assembly."
"69",2832,"GRC",64,2009,"On behalf of Her Excellency the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Hellenic Republic  Ms. Dora Bakoyannis  who unfortunately could not be in New York today  I would like to address the General Assembly.  Allow me first to congratulate the President of this body  Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki. I am confident that his extensive prior experience will serve us well and guide us through the trials that we are called upon to address. I would also like to pay tribute to Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann for his tireless efforts to promote the work of the General Assembly during its sixty-third session.  I cannot but take pride in addressing the General Assembly of the most important ecumenical institution humankind has ever created  the original idea of which was initially conceived and put into practice by Greeks 25 centuries ago. The ancient Greek Amphictyony was the precursor and matrix of the concept of multilateralism  which is the only way to deal effectively with the many and varied challenges faced by the international community. The United Nations is in fact  along with the various regional alliances and organizations  the essential framework for joining forces and collectively confronting our common threats and promoting our common values.  Greece currently has the privilege of being at the helm of one of the most important regional security organizations  the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). The OSCE’s consensus-based decision-making process  along with its comprehensive approach to security  is a testament to the power of multilateralism. Greece has pledged to be an honest broker and to work with every single participating State to realize the common vision for peace  security and development for all 56 members of the organization. The Corfu Process  our common promise to turn the page on European security within the framework of a structured all-inclusive dialogue  proves once more that where there is a will there is a way.  Indeed  our annual gathering at the United Nations is important  but it is not enough. What is needed first and foremost is the political will to turn words into deeds. We stand at a most critical juncture   27 09-53165  for our environmental  social and economic future  and all of us — policy-makers  diplomats  scientists  activists and concerned citizens alike — have a responsibility to preserve the habitability of our planet and hand over to our children a better world than the one bequeathed to us.  It was Aristotle who said that nature acts as if she foresees the future  and currently nature’s auguries are not encouraging at all. We cannot afford to forget that our planet is in a state of environmental emergency. Scientific evidence on the issue is compelling. The socio-economic impact of climate change on the global economy  if left unchecked  is likely to dwarf the current economic recession.   Now is the time to speed up our joint efforts to effectively address the negative impact of climate change  while respecting the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and the respective capabilities of each country. Copenhagen will be the litmus test of our commitment to an ambitious  all-inclusive climate change agreement.  The urgency of the situation is such that  if I may paraphrase the man who first set foot on the moon  even if man now takes a giant leap in trying to mitigate the consequences of climate change  it will unfortunately still only be a small step for mankind. But small steps are important too. Greece continues to strongly support the financing of climate change adaptation and mitigation projects and of low-carbon development strategies. We have repeatedly proven our commitment to this effect by supporting the most vulnerable countries’ adaptation to climate change through the provision of a total sum of €21 million through the end of 2011.  The challenges posed to all nations by the current economic crisis require an ambitious and imaginative range of responses that provide effective and lasting solutions. The United Nations can play a vital role in achieving these objectives. Our commitment to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) needs to be reaffirmed. Regenerating the world economy and promoting sustainable pro-growth policies are fundamental to solving the crisis and essential to maintaining and improving progress towards the achievement of the MDGs. Support for the most vulnerable nations  which have been even more deeply affected by food insecurity and climate change  is where a special effort must be made.  Our action against hunger and want has not yet produced the desired results  while humanitarian and development aid needs to be streamlined in order to be more effective and productive. Synergetic multilateral action is urgently needed. People living on the edge have run out of time. They need to know whether the decisions of their leaders at the Pittsburgh summit are the right decisions that will put us back on the road to development.  We know that climate change  the economic crisis and the North-South divide are exacerbating pressures on people to migrate. These crises are creating living conditions that contribute to one of the greatest disgraces of humanity and one of the greatest insults to human dignity — the modern slave trade or human trafficking.   Some 192 million people have been forced from the lands of their birth. Almost a million people have been arrested since 2000 while trying to cross from Turkey to Greece in their quest for a better life. This modern form of the slave trade has claimed thousands of lives. We owe it to them and to the people who have lost their lives to change things  to fight traffickers and work together to discourage illegal migration by bringing development and giving a vision to countries that migrants leave.   Athens will host the Global Forum on Migration and Development from 2 to 5 November 2009. We seek specific proposals for actions and policies and we want to formulate best practices for adoption by the participating States.  Terrorism continues to pose a serious threat to international peace  stability and security. The international commitment to confronting terrorism must remain strong  and our efforts to successfully address this challenge should be intensified. But if our efforts are to be successful and self-sustaining  they must garner the broadest possible consensus and acceptance and be based on respect for the fundamental principles of international law and international humanitarian law and on full respect for and the protection of human rights.  This brings me to an issue that has come to the forefront of international attention and concern — the issue of human rights. Respect for human rights is one of the cornerstones of the contemporary legal order. Human rights conventions and institutions have raised the awareness and sensitivity of States  Governments    09-53165 28  civil society  international organizations and non-governmental organizations.  Greece has submitted its candidacy for a seat on the United Nations Human Rights Council for the period 2012-2015  as it wishes to play a proactive role in the protection of human rights. We believe that the Council can play a crucial role in the improvement of the situation of human rights worldwide. That role should not be restricted to pointing out the violators  but should mainly help overcome shortfalls and implement universal standards.  Interest in the protection of human rights must be genuine and anthropocentric  and protection must be carried out in full compliance with the fundamental principles of international law and the Charter of the United Nations.   We should award a special place to gender issues in the system of human rights protection. Women’s rights deserve all our attention  because they continue to be violated systematically and flagrantly in many corners of the world. Education and equal working opportunities are key areas.  As I said earlier  Greece approached its current term in office as OSCE Chair with a heightened sense of responsibility and sensitivity  based on the belief that security and stability are not and should not be a zero-sum game. In the post-cold-war era  where security challenges are multifaceted and interlinked  the security needs of all States should be given due consideration despite contradictory and often mutually exclusive political perceptions of what is right and just.  Since January  our aim has been to build consensus and achieve collective and comprehensive solutions to deep-rooted and protracted conflicts  convinced that enhancing the security of one will undoubtedly enhance the security of all. Our efforts have been based on mutual trust and confidence and on the realization that security is both indivisible and comprehensive. In some cases however  as in Georgia  consensus has been elusive.  Our most important collective achievement has been the launching of the Corfu Process  a profound and open debate on the future of security in Europe. The Corfu Process marks a pan-European effort to revisit and redefine the broader European security system. At the Athens Ministerial Meeting in December  we aim to lay a solid foundation  so that our dialogue will start producing tangible results.  A few days ago the Security Council adopted resolution 1887 (2009)  thus taking an important step in the direction of advancing nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. We applaud that important decision. Yet  practical tools are essential for the achievement of high-minded political goals such as this. Greece firmly believes that the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons remains the cornerstone of the nuclear non-proliferation regime. Broad participation in it  along with the conclusion of comprehensive safeguards agreements and the implementation of the additional protocol  is  beyond any doubt  the most effective answer to threats of nuclear proliferation. It is equally important to have additional ratifications of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and the early drafting of a fissile material cut-off treaty.  As regards major international and regional issues  conflicts and flashpoints  Greece fully subscribes to the European Union (EU) policy and action  as described by its presidency. The role of the EU in the handling of a number of urgent and difficult situations  such as piracy in Somalia  has proved to be vital  successful and effective.  The broader region of South-Eastern Europe and the Eastern Mediterranean is at the forefront of Greek foreign policy. It is a vital region from a geopolitical and geo-strategic perspective  but also one of the most volatile areas of the world. Our vision for the region incorporates the consolidation of security  stability and development. Our aim is to work with all neighbouring States in the region to promote stability  democracy and robust economies  with the ultimate goal of elevating the quality of life of the citizens to the highest European standards. This vision is founded on four pillars: first  the establishment and safeguarding of good neighbourly relations; secondly  the full integration of all the countries of South-Eastern Europe into European and Euro-Atlantic structures; thirdly  the enhancement and further deepening of regional cooperation in the fields of infrastructure  economy and trade; and  last but not least  the strengthening of bonds and cultural interaction at the level of civil societies. We are doing everything in our power to materialize this vision.  We continue to build upon the agenda of the Thessaloniki European Council of 2003  which laid the   29 09-53165  foundations for the integration of the Western Balkan countries into the European Union  on the condition  of course  that the accession criteria and requirements are fully met. The prospect of a future within Europe for almost all the Western Balkan countries is now within reach and seems more feasible than ever.  At the same time  Greece is promoting regional cooperation by financing of and participating in significant infrastructure projects  and by joining forces with other neighbouring countries to establish a reliable and adequate energy-distribution network. It is one of the top investment and trade partners in most of the neighbouring countries  thus contributing to the development of the entire area.  Above all  we are working hard to establish and consolidate good neighbourly relations by pursuing and promoting the peaceful settlement of disputes on the basis of international law. However  long-standing disputes persist. For the past 15 years Greece has participated in United Nations-led negotiations on the issue of the name of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Greece has participated in good faith. Regrettably  no substantive or tangible progress has been made so far  despite the fact that Greece has taken a huge step towards a compromise. We have accepted the use of the term “Macedonia” along with a geographical qualifier that reflects reality. Of the large geographical region of Macedonia  only a part falls within our neighbour’s territory. So how can this country claim exclusive rights to the name? The persistence of the leadership in Skopje in claiming exclusive rights to the name by denying a geographic qualifier and the anachronistic rhetoric and policies that run contrary to the principle of good neighbourly relations raise serious questions as to that Government’s real motives. Greece is negotiating for a solution that will respect the dignity of both countries and both peoples. We are negotiating for a clear solution to which both sides will agree and which our neighbour will use with pride in its dealings with everyone — a solution that will make everyone a winner.  The Cyprus issue is still an open wound at the very heart of Europe. Thanks to the efforts of President Christofias  a new round of talks has started under the auspices of the United Nations. This gives rise to hope  but there is still a long way to go  and there are many hurdles and difficulties to overcome. Greece supports a definitive  sustainable and just solution  based on the United Nations resolutions and compatible with European Union values  principles and institutional framework  one that will lead to the reunification of the island. We strongly believe that the two communities should be left alone  with no external pressures  guidance or interventions  to decide on their common future. The solution must be theirs and theirs alone. Artificial deadlines  strict time frames and threats of a permanent division have no role in the quest for a durable solution. They add unnecessary pressure and strain to the delicate negotiating process and raise questions about the true intentions of those promoting them.  The current situation in Cyprus is unacceptable. Turkish military forces continue to occupy part of the territory of a European Union member State. Turkey — a European Union candidate — refuses to recognize a fully fledged European Union member and future partner. Once-vibrant cities like Famagusta remain ghost towns. The families of missing persons continue to wonder about their loved ones’ fates  while the unspeakable atrocities of the past come to light  little by little. This picture is unimaginable in the eyes of the average European citizen and completely incompatible with today’s European reality. We hope that the Cypriot people — both Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots — will be able to leave behind the painful past and look  reunited  to the future that awaits them within the European family  which constitutes the best guarantee for their security and prosperity. Turkey  which holds the key to the solution of the Cyprus issue  knows full well that such a solution would also speed up its own journey to the European Union.  Greece is probably the most sincere supporter of Turkey’ s accession to the European Union — and this is true even at a difficult time. It is our conviction that Turkey would be a better neighbour for Greece if it carried out all necessary reforms and became a European Union member State. Turkish membership would contribute to stability in our region. Yet  this is not a blank check  nor is it a leap of faith. In order to become a member of the European Union  Turkey will have to fulfil all the criteria set by the European Union.  The Government I represent has invested in Greek-Turkish rapprochement. Kostas Karamanlis is the first Greek Prime Minister to have paid an official visit to Ankara in 40 years. We dared to turn the page. We went beyond words  but we have not seen an active response from the other side. Turkey declares that it   09-53165 30  wants zero problems with its neighbours. Yet  Turkish fighter jets kept flying only a few metres above the rooftops of Greek islanders’ homes throughout the summer. The Turkish Parliament maintains a threat of war against my country.  Disputes should be settled peacefully and in accordance with international law. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea  which embodies customary law  shows the way to settle maritime boundary disputes peacefully. Greece would welcome a decision by Turkey to follow the example of the other 160 Members of the United Nations that have ratified the Convention. Such a move  along with clear political will on the Turkish side to invest in friendly relations with Greece  could strike a definitive blow to the tensions and mistrust in our bilateral relations and contribute to the promotion of peace and stability in our entire region.  Aristotle proposed that it is possible to fail in many ways  while to succeed is possible in only one way. It is our conviction that this one way is effective multilateralism led by the United Nations. We need the leadership of the United Nations  if we are to carry out our ultimate mission — safeguarding the dignity  lives and freedoms of the citizens we represent. We need to give the Secretary-General the tools to guide this Organization  so that the United Nations can once again take up its central role in international life and meet the myriad challenges facing humanity. We have to identify the weaknesses of the United Nations and we must have the courage to redress them  using common sense  just as we would do at home  in our countries  because every failure of the United Nations is a personal failure for each and every one of us  and because the world is changing  and we have to change with it."
"70",2873,"GRD",64,2009,"I am honoured  Sir  to add Grenada’s voice to the many warm congratulations offered you on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. Grenada looks forward to working with you and pledges to support your leadership as you exercise impartial stewardship over this fine institution. Equally  we commend your predecessor  Father Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann  for his dedication and conviction in pursuing the vision of the United Nations as a home for social justice for all  particularly those who carry the greatest burden.  Through you  Mr. President  Grenada wishes to highly commend Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and his staff for their performance over the past year in advancing the work of this Organization and “delivering as one”. We thank the Secretary-General for his interest and participation in the recently concluded Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) Climate Change Summit  chaired by Grenada. We wish him and the Secretariat every continued success.  The challenges facing the global community are mirrored in our regional and national context. Fortunately  we have no better place than within these hallowed walls to continue the long and important journey of building a better world. We cannot respond to one challenge and choose to ignore another  because all of them are interconnected. Indeed  working together is our raison d’être — the essence of the “united” in the United Nations.  Climate change is rightfully described as the most urgent threat facing mankind  and  at least for the next several months  it will remain at the top of the global diplomatic and negotiating agenda. But what is the challenge of climate change if not a risk to development  security and peace? What is the threat of climate change  if not a threat to the very notion of human survival and ecological balance? For small States  this threat is particularly pronounced.  Today  I address this Assembly on the heels of two very important responses to climate change — the AOSIS Climate Change Summit and the Secretary-General’s summit on climate change. What is clear from these very well attended global meetings is that for developing countries such as Grenada  the alarm has been sounded — the alarm that climate change is bearing down on our countries and undermining our potential for both economic recovery in the short term and economic growth in the longer term.  It is hampering our efforts to attain sustainable development  as set out in the Barbados Plan of Action and the Mauritius Strategy for Further Implementation. In the case of Grenada  this is due to our dependence on our natural resource base  which supports   09-53165 2  agriculture and tourism. Together  they account for more than 40 per cent of our gross domestic product (GDP)  and they are extremely vulnerable to the negative impacts of storms  hurricanes and other economically disruptive events induced by climate change. Hurricane Ivan in 2004 brought home this reality  causing damage estimated to be equivalent to 204 per cent of GDP at the time. The country is still recovering from that event. Grenada is not unique among small island States around the world in experiencing those impacts.  The gap in terms of the experience of the reality of climate change between those Member States already impacted and all others needs to be urgently bridged. If we fail to do that  the United Nations itself will have to bear the consequences of the humanitarian and environmental crisis resulting from the fact that some islands will no longer be inhabitable.  When my Prime Minister  the Honourable Tillman Thomas  addressed the Secretary-General’s summit on 22 September  he spoke on behalf of the most vulnerable States. For these 80 or more poor island and landlocked States  a rise in temperature of two degrees Celsius is unacceptable  for our safety and survival will most certainly be at risk. That is why we insist on a global commitment to ensuring an average temperature increase of no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius  accompanied by appropriate midterm targets of a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by more than 45 per cent of 1990 levels by 2020 and by more than 95 per cent by 2050. These reduction levels respond to our vulnerabilities  and surely  in a United Nations system to which we all belong  it is unthinkable that known threats will be allowed to turn into grave risks.   We must solve the climate change crisis and we must solve it now. Estimates place the cost of financing adaptation and mitigation at about 1 per cent of the industrialized world’s GDP — that is a contribution of $10 000 for every million dollars of GDP. Given the moral principle of historical responsibility  this is affordable by any measure.  With the adoption of the AOSIS Climate Change Declaration  small island States have said we will not stand by and watch our islands sink  see our livelihoods disappear and witness our children made homeless due to the effects of human-induced climate change. We again call on the international community to stand in support of the most vulnerable  so as to ensure that the targets set forth in the AOSIS Climate Change Declaration are agreed to in Copenhagen. Grenada will continue to play its part in highlighting the needs of the most vulnerable while advocating for the strengthening of their capacity for resilience. While it continues to chair AOSIS  Grenada will always advocate for sustainable development goals as well as for agreements in the Copenhagen negotiations that are commensurate to the level of the threat.  The financial and economic crises continue to undermine economies worldwide. The green shoots of recovery need to blossom everywhere. Grenada continues to insist  as our Prime Minister Tillman Thomas stated at the June summit on the crisis  that the global financial and economic architecture needs fundamental and far-reaching reforms (see A/CONF.214/PV.1). Changes are needed in its rules  regulations and governance in order to facilitate the effective participation of small economies  which suffer the effects of the crises harder and longer. Here  we wish to echo the call for reform of the international financial institutions  particularly the call for a review of the policy conditions attached to lending by the International Monetary Fund.  Grenada continues to pursue sustainable economic development and prosperity for our people  as they show resilience to economic setbacks. A study by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations shows that Latin America and the Caribbean was the most successful region before the surge in food prices in 2008. That affirms our efforts.   However  another study showed that in times of crisis  social spending does not favour the poor and development goals are stymied. This is our fear  and it is also our reality. That is why the Government introduced a package of measures  greatly supported by financing from the Trinidad and Tobago Petroleum Fund  which has begun to lay the basis for developing a low-carbon and rights-based economic development model. In this regard  we wish to thank the Government of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago for its continued assistance to Grenada and to the Caribbean region through its contribution to this Fund. We are also grateful for the Petrocaribe agreement with the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela  through which several Caribbean countries are able to purchase oil on softer terms.   3 09-53165   Grenada has put in place strategic initiatives that include revitalizing the agricultural sector  increasing labour productivity  diversifying the export-services sector  strengthening the national investment environment and modernizing our tax system. In implementing those initiatives  we seek partnerships with the international community and the United Nations system.  Trade continues to be of major importance to Grenada. We are experiencing severe setbacks from the loss of preferential treatment in agricultural markets. We are among the smallest and most open markets in the world. And yet larger countries contest whatever benefits we receive to offset the disadvantages of our small economic size  which are compounded by high transportation cost and energy prices.  Grenada is pleased that the United Nations system continues to pursue economic growth and development. We support the perspective that any outcome in Copenhagen must be a development outcome  for each is connected to the other. We urge support for meeting the Millennium Development Goals. We have made progress by achieving 80 per cent primary school enrolment  by reducing violence against women and by scaling up access to antiretroviral drugs for persons living with HIV/AIDS.   All the same  Grenada is striving to achieve a faster rate of poverty eradication. That goal  however  is hampered by the drop in revenue caused by the economic downturn and by our heavy debt burden  which now stands at 107 per cent of GDP. That is why we add our voice to the call for a review of the criteria for determining middle-income status. For while we welcome efforts to assist highly indebted poor countries  States such as Grenada that are currently referred to as highly indebted middle-income countries deserve special attention.  The Government of Grenada favours peace and reconciliation  aspiring to bring people together to work for a common good. From that platform we pursue true partnership for development  beginning with the private sector  trade unions and civil society. Together  then  as one nation  we face the international community.  Development is important in its own right. It also serves as a guarantor for peace and security. We urge the United Nations to continue its efforts in peacebuilding and peacekeeping. My country continues to support those efforts in the Caribbean region  to which we have contributed a small number of officers.  We welcome the reopening of the office of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime in Barbados to serve the eastern Caribbean region  and we highlight the need for more intervention to stop drug trafficking.   In our region  the proliferation of small arms is as lethal as nuclear weapons. So while we welcome the unanimously adopted Security Council resolution 1887 (2009) on nuclear disarmament  shepherded by President Obama  we in the Caribbean call for an agreement on the small arms trade.  Grenada again calls the Assembly’s attention to the need to ensure the protection of the Caribbean Sea. The States of the Caribbean Community and members of the Association of Caribbean States depend on the tremendous benefits from the pristine waters of the Caribbean Sea. Yet those ocean-based resources are threatened by the trans-shipment of nuclear and other hazardous waste materials through our waters. We look to the General Assembly to strengthen the resolution on this issue and to ensure that the threat is removed as soon as possible.  In what United States President Barack Obama calls the new era of engagement  we believe that we face three major undertakings. The first is to respond to whatever threatens us at a level commensurate to the threat; second  to strengthen the institutional capacity of the United Nations to enable it to respond; and third  the sacredness of this grand institution to inspire humanity.  In this endeavour  Grenada is guided by its national values  the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and its participation in the hemispheric system and the Caribbean regional integration process. Consequently  we reject the removal of the duly elected head of State in Honduras and call for the immediate restoration of President José Manuel Zelaya to the position to which he was legitimately elected.  The maintenance of the 40-year United States embargo against Cuba and the failure to bring into being a homeland and State for the Palestinian people  despite numerous United Nations resolutions on both issues  remain of deep concern  for they violate the spirit and letter of international law  on which this Organization is founded. We join the entire Caribbean community in calling for an end to the United States   09-53165 4  embargo against Cuba and urge the normalization of relations between the two countries. We call for a sincere engagement to resolve the long-standing Palestinian-Israeli and wider Middle East conflict. Resolution of those entrenched conflicts will generate the momentum needed for resolving similar conflicts in other regions in Africa and elsewhere.  The United Nations plays a critical role in every facet of global affairs. That is its strength. To become more effective  the Organization must necessarily become stronger  and that is why the resolution on system-wide coherence is timely and has our support. Likewise  the reform of the Security Council must not be put off for another 16 years. Reform must mean greater democratization by removing the veto  enlarging permanent and non-permanent categories and making operating rules and procedures transparent.  Grenada is proud to continue playing its role at the United Nations. We support the pursuit of international peace and security  the rule of law and the fight against terrorism and for the eradication of poverty and the promotion of human rights. We support the agenda of the Non-Aligned Movement  and the Group of 77 and China. We support the just ambitions of Africa  and we proudly support the initiative of the Government of South Africa to mark and celebrate  across the globe  18 July as Nelson Mandela Day  a day of selfless giving.  We welcome the United Nations support for the initiative to establish the permanent memorial to honour the victims of slavery and the transatlantic slave trade: lest we forget. That memorial is addressed to all humanity so that we may draw the lessons of yesteryear for our empowerment. We thank all Member States which have already contributed  and we encourage others to support the Permanent Memorial Fund.  Grenada continues to value the role of the United Nations as the pre-eminent institution for effecting multilateral diplomacy. We support its ability to ensure international peace and stability and to accord a voice to all sovereign States  as enshrined in its Charter. We have made significant and meaningful progress in previous sessions of the General Assembly. Let this sixty-fourth session be another outstanding forward movement in meeting the most pressing global challenges of our time."
"71",2920,"GTM",64,2009,"At the outset  I would like to salute Mr. Ali Treki  our President and a distinguished diplomat. I wish him much success in leading the deliberations of this session. At the same time  I would like to express our admiration and respect for Father Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann  who led the Assembly at its last session.  My presence highlights our commitment to multilateralism in general and to the United Nations in particular. I salute Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and reiterate to him our appreciation for his management. Allow me to say how the Guatemalan people appreciate and value the presence of the United Nations. We try to reciprocate  in part with our participation in various peacekeeping operations.  I would like to touch briefly on some topics that are at the heart of our concerns but that at the same time have an important international dimension.  First  like the other countries of our region  Guatemala has been strongly impacted by the international economic and financial crisis. This fact is reflected in the value and volume of our exports  in the level of family remittances and especially in the level of economic activity  employment and tax collection.    09-52425 36  In more general terms  the crisis has made it more difficult for us to meet the Millennium Development Goals.  To make matters worse  our efforts to mitigate the impact of the crisis have been partially annulled by an irregular climatic event  as we are suffering the worst drought in the last thirty years. This phenomenon has affected the harvest of basic grains and has had a serious impact on the poorest regions of our country. Because of this  I decided to declare a state of emergency. The disaster is not just because of the drought  but also an historic disaster  striking the poorest people in our country  whom our Government is aiming to lift from extreme poverty.  This situation illustrates one of the manifold manifestations of climate change occurring in diverse regions  and it comes on top of the burden of the regressive effects we experienced during the first half of 2008  in the double crises of energy and food  followed by the aforementioned effects of the economic crisis. Unfortunately  the adverse effects of this situation disproportionately affect those sectors of the population with less capacity and less income. The picture is complicated by the fact that the imperative of the State to address the people’s needs is severely restricted by fiscal considerations.  Nevertheless  we are not sitting on our hands  far from it. We have surged forward with a dynamic and strong social cohesion programme. Today  more than half a million families are covered by programmes in the poorest and most excluded regions of the country. Today  I note with real satisfaction that in only 18 months since our Administration began  our health indicators — all of the health indicators — have improved to an extraordinary extent.  Education indicators have improved. For example  this year enrolment increased by 37 per cent in secondary education  by 9 per cent in primary education and by 27 per cent in preschool. Now we have the problem of schools that cannot cope with the number of children  but we prefer that problem to not having children in school. This means that there is an urgent need to build more than 14 400 classrooms over the next 14 months  but we prefer that to having children on the streets or working.  The international cooperation that we have received in this effort is important  and we would like to recognize here the support of the Inter-American Development Bank  the World Bank and the Central American Bank for Economic Integration  which have helped us with our efforts to build social cohesion and to support the indigenous people who constitute our population.  I wish to sincerely express our total conviction with regard to the change that we all must make. It is a change of attitude  a change of will  as President Lula said yesterday. It is important that we see the birth of this new international order  this new order of justice and equity.   The drought in Guatemala exacerbated abject poverty  but a solution to drought will not resolve the poverty situation in the country  because it is structural and historical  resulting from 50 years of neglect of rural populations and our indigenous peoples.   We will follow with interest the deliberations of the Group of 20  which is meeting this very day in Pittsburgh. We trust that that exclusive forum will also take into account the concerns of countries with small and medium-sized economies. In addition  we support the efforts being promoted within the multilateral international financial institutions and the United Nations to improve their capacity to help developing countries and to address the crisis. That is why our country is seriously promoting the capitalization of the Inter-American Development Bank and our regional financial organization  the Central American Bank for Economic Integration.   I should like to mention the lack of security in our country. Our country is being assaulted by organized crime  and our Government  within the space of a year and a half  has begun a merciless war against it. In this forum  I wish to express my appreciation for the magnificent cooperation and support that we have received  particularly from Colombia  Panama and Mexico  to attack and staunch the scourge of drug trafficking and to begin a process of eliminating it.   I also wish to inform the Assembly with great satisfaction that  in terms of seizures of cocaine alone  we have seen a 700 per cent increase compared with the same period under the previous Government; seizures of marijuana have risen fifteenfold  and poppy eradication has increased by 300 per cent during the same period. Our efforts against drug trafficking are definitive and resolute  but we recognize that it is a phenomenon that must be attacked at the regional level. That is why we are working closely with the   37 09-52425  fraternal country of Mexico and our Central American brothers to address it directly and regionally.  The problem of drug trafficking has had a serious impact on Guatemala. For more than eight years  the country was handed over to organized crime — specifically  drug trafficking — leaving territories and trafficking corridors more unprotected than ever before. The national army was reduced beyond the level mandated by peace agreements  and territorial control was suspended. The National Civilian Police were seriously compromised by drug traffickers  becoming corrupt and dishonest.   However  thanks to the United Nations and the presence of the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala — a United Nations exercise in Guatemala  unique in the world — we have support and advice for our Public Ministry  and our prosecutors and are making significant progress. For the first time in Guatemala’s history  one of the drug-trafficking bosses is a fugitive  and we will capture him very soon. The notorious drug-trafficking families have never been sent such a strong message.   We have also imprisoned 10 murder suspects connected to the 10 May crisis. I take this opportunity to thank this forum  the United Nations  for the unrestricted support provided to my Government during the crisis. I am confident that the efforts of the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala will reach the masterminds of that despicable crime and that the truth will be found and justice done. What could have become a technical coup d’état has become a genuine example of justice and truth. I am sure that my Government  which has ensured the total independence of this investigation  will get to the heart of the matter and that the truth will soon be found.  We have worked hard on the security of our citizens  and I recognize that it is a long and complicated process. Here again  the assistance of the International Commission is essential  and we believe that this experience will be effectively used by our Public Ministry  which has already begun the process of re-engineering and restructuring itself.   I should like to mention the case of Honduras  our fraternal neighbouring country. From the very beginning  Guatemala has supported a return to democracy and the rule of law in Honduras. Nowhere in the world  much less in Central America — where democracy has cost us so many lives and where so many deaths and  in the case of Guatemala  massacres  have affected us — can we allow a President to be deposed at gunpoint and fail to use democratic and legal mechanisms. We will accept nothing less than the return of President Zelaya to power so that the elections in Honduras can be carried out legitimately and our Honduran brothers can soon live in peace and tranquillity. Our Government has been unsparing in its support for President Zelaya  and I am sure that we will see Central America return to its natural rhythm of integration  democratic development and democratic security.  I should also like to highlight our adherence to nearly all human rights mechanisms  principles and norms within and outside Guatemala. We are a multi-ethnic  pluri-cultural and multilingual nation. We have a beautiful 108 000-square-kilometre country with 23 cultures and 23 peoples sharing the blessed land that God gave us. That is why we are committed to promoting the strengthening of the participation of all the indigenous peoples of Guatemala in terms of our daily life  development  peace and security.  We have adopted a law on free access to information  with very few problems  which has guaranteed free access to all State information except that related to security matters and foreign relations. That is why we wish to stress the need to strengthen the mechanisms for human rights and arms control. I believe that countries have the freedom to arm themselves for defence  but I do not agree that our countries should be arms-trafficking corridors. I also believe that countries exporting armaments should be more careful and have more controls and standards with regard to the entire weapons trade. Our country  my Government  has increased its seizures of illegal weapons almost tenfold  but we still have much work ahead of us. Meanwhile  many innocent people are dying as a result of drug trafficking  smuggling and organized crime.   Let us make progress in the definition of the concept of the responsibility to protect our respective populations from genocide and war crimes  which we have already endured; ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity  from which Guatemala suffered greatly for 36 years.   I wish to express my total conviction that the United Nations must be constantly renewed and    09-52425 38  adapted to today’s needs. Our civilization is changing. This is a crisis not just of energy or finance or climate; it is a crisis of values  of principles. The financial crisis is a crisis of values and principles  and we are paying for it with the poverty of our people. That is why we need better adaptation of the United Nations mechanisms so we can really get to the bottom — al grano  as we say in Guatemala — of the problems of poverty and inequality  to strengthen democracy and the rule of law.  I have the honour to be familiar with the Mayan cosmic vision  and I am quite sure that in 2012  the transformation of civilization it prophesied will begin. This is a very ancient prophecy and it will be fulfilled  just as all the others have been. We will enter an era of great humanity and great human strength. And America is also changing. If you look at the Americas today  they have nothing to do with the way they were 10 years ago. Democracy  although it has problems  has improved and been strengthened  thank heaven.  We support United Nations and Organization of American States (OAS) resolutions with regard to Honduras  and I am also happy to affirm that we have made very concrete progress in honourably ending our historical dispute with our brother nation of Belize. In December  under the good offices of the OAS  both Governments signed a special agreement  which  prior to complying with the domestic ratification processes of our Congresses  commits us to seek a juridical settlement through the International Court of Justice. We hope that  through these internal procedures  we will be able to proceed to plebiscites in both countries  in order to put an end to the dispute with our brother country of Belize.  I would like to conclude with some very brief reflections on our Organization and its agenda for the future. I would like it to continue to give priority to the poor  those with limited incomes  children  young people living in the mountains of our countries who do not have access to health care  education or drinking water. The drought and the malnutrition we are seeing among our children in Guatemala are nothing more than the product of historical injustice. If all of us in the United Nations share in this fight to help those who have so little  I am sure that we will have more for everyone. The more we support those who have less  the more we will all have in the end. I hope that this Assembly session reaches a fruitful conclusion."
"72",2963,"GUY",64,2009,"I extend our gratitude to the Secretary-General for continuing to spearhead the work of the United Nations at a time when our membership is beset by historic challenges.  I am told that it is only what one says from the rostrum that is reflected in the record of the meeting. I hope that perhaps in the future  we can change the system. If we do so  we may be able to say more without spending a lot of time at the rostrum. So I shall circulate the full text of my speech and focus on only two areas that I think are important at this point in time. The first has to do with the financial crisis and its impact on the Caribbean  and the second concerns the climate change crisis.   In the case of the prevailing financial crisis  the small  vulnerable economies of the Caribbean have had to bear the brunt of global recession. That has manifested itself both through depressed prices for primary exported commodities  such as bauxite  and through depressed demand for services  such as tourism. The result has been losses in export and foreign currency earnings  with attendant dislocation of exchange rates and Government revenues  exacerbating an already tenuous fiscal and debt situation and causing the loss of jobs and welfare and a reversal of gains previously made against poverty.  Even as we seek long-term solutions to bolster the resilience of our economies  the need for relief and support is immediate. The capacity of the small countries of the Caribbean to respond with    09-52425 12  countercyclical measures is virtually non-existent  with no available fiscal space and levels of indebtedness that are among the highest in the world. The case is therefore compelling for the global community to relieve and restructure the debt of these heavily indebted vulnerable small countries  including those that were not previously considered for debt relief because of their income levels  but whose debt ratios are clearly unsustainable by any standard.  The case is equally compelling for new additional flows of development assistance to be delivered to these countries by both multilateral and bilateral development partners. Despite injections of large amounts of additional resources into some of the multilateral institutions and the approval of new facilities by those institutions  very little has actually materialized in terms of additionality in disbursements to smaller States. This needs to be corrected urgently if we are to avoid the perception that there is an absence of concern at the global level for the needs of smaller countries.  My fear is that  as the crisis abates  so too will the will to change the global financial architecture. Therefore  we are advocating urgent action in this area  and we are also saying that this solution — a new global financial architecture — must involve smaller countries in its articulation. Our fear is that  if we continue along the same path  we will have a new architecture that caters only to the concerns of the large countries — now expanded to the Group of 20 — and that the smaller countries will not see their concerns reflected in it. That is why  last year  I called for a new Bretton Woods-type conference at which all the countries in this Hall would help to create that architecture.   The second crisis that I wish to mention is that of climate change. This week  there has been much talk about the urgency of tackling climate change. Thanks to the vision exhibited by the Secretary-General and the work of leaders and citizens from countries across the world  the level of understanding about the nature of the climate challenge is increasingly clear.  But we need to move beyond simply understanding the challenge. We need to work as a global community to shape a solution that is in the interests of all countries  and many of the building blocks that will enable us to do this have been identified. The challenge for the Copenhagen meeting is to turn these building blocks into an agreement that can start to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  In doing so  we should be guided by science and by the need for solutions that treat all countries fairly. But we also need to recognize that the challenge now is as much about political will as it is about scientific  economic and institutional considerations. In addressing the politics  we need to recognize that in all countries — developed and developing — there are concerns about the commitment of others to the long-term global partnership we need. Many developing countries question whether the international community will commit to the scale of financial transfers that all major analyses agree are needed. Others are worried that acting on climate change now will stymie their national development  precisely at a time when many are poised for historic levels of economic growth and social advances.  On the other hand  many developed countries are worried that the financial transfers needed will be an excessive burden on their budgets during extremely challenging economic times. Domestic constituencies in the developed world are also fearful about transferring significant sums of money abroad  and they worry that jobs or investment will be driven away from their economies. There are also fears from individual countries that they will be expected to carry a greater burden than other developed nations. These political concerns could be a recipe for a stalemate that the world cannot afford. Failure to overcome them now will mean misery for future generations  and the eventual costs of tackling climate change will be even greater than they are now.   We therefore need to find a way through. This will require leadership from all nations. I welcome the proposals laid out by Gordon Brown  and subsequently supported by the European Union  to generate funding in excess of $100 billion per annum to address climate change in the developing world. For the first time  there is a proposal that starts to square up to the magnitude of funding that is required for adaptation and mitigation.  Having spoken with many of my fellow leaders this week  I am confident that  with the right signal from the developed world  developing countries are ready to play their part. Of particular urgency will be finding ways to work together to address the 17 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions that result from   13 09-52425  tropical deforestation and forest degradation globally. As with climate change in general  we now have a large degree of clarity around the nature of this specific problem. We know that it causes more emissions than the entire European Union  and we know that this is because the world economy makes trees worth more dead than alive. We also know that the only sustainable way to address the problem is national-scale action in forest countries coupled with international incentives that place a value on trees to make them worth more alive than dead.  We now need to rapidly move from constantly rearticulating this problem towards putting in place workable solutions. In Guyana  we remain ready to play our part  and we have launched our low-carbon development strategy  which sets out how we can place our entire forest under long-term protection  not only to provide the world with badly needed climate services  but also to move our economy onto a long-term  sustainable low-carbon development path  where jobs are created across our country in sectors that do not threaten our trees.  Thanks to the visionary leadership of the Prime Minister of Norway  our two countries are also working together to provide a functioning model of how low-deforestation and low-carbon economies can be created in countries such as ours.  In parallel  Guyana continues to play its part in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) process  which must provide the long-term framework for combating forest-based emissions through the United Nations Collaborative Programme on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries (REDD) or the REDD+ Programme. But we also believe that the world can move quickly to slow down deforestation starting now  not in 2013. Guyana was pleased to participate in the April G-20 side meeting that addressed how this can happen. We support the proposals made by the informal working group on interim financing for REDD  which was set up after the G-20 side meeting. We support its report  which lays out how the world can achieve a 25 per cent reduction in global deforestation rates by 2015 with an investment of less than €25 billion in total.   Using highly conservative estimates of forest carbon  this could lead to seven gigatons of greenhouse gas emissions being avoided between now and 2015. If this occurred  it would be the single biggest contribution to averting climate catastrophe over this period. And it can be done. Rainforest countries representing the vast majority of the world’s tropical forests have worked with the informal working group and are willing to act. The question now is: Will the developed world understand the enormous potential this offers our world  and will it act to generate the finances that are needed?  The sum of money needed for this interim period may seem large  but it does not only represent a very good value for money abatement solution; it can also generate significant financial flows for developing countries  it can create alternative livelihoods for indigenous peoples and other forest-dependent communities  and it can preserve the enormous biodiversity present in the world’s forests.  Twenty-five billion euros over five years represent less than 1.5 cents per citizen per day in developed countries. It is a fraction of what the world has generated to save the financial system from collapse  it provides a bridge to a long-term REDD+ solution under the UNFCCC  and it buys the world badly needed time in the race to defeat climate change. To turn away from making this proposal a reality would be a mistake of historic proportions.  I have just said to President Chávez Frías that I wish I could conclude by singing  but I do not have his wonderful voice. Instead  I will confine myself to saying that we all have an important role to play in solving this crisis  but the developed world has a moral obligation to play a greater part in solving both the financial crisis and the climate change crisis  because it is due to its actions that we are in this situation. I hope that the developed world recognizes this obligation and the urgency to act upon it now. "
"73",3008,"HND",64,2009,"For the past three years the President of Honduras has come to this global forum to propose simple  honest  straightforward ways of responding to the great challenges that face our societies  because of the need to do more to contribute to the survival of the human species and to decrease the injustice of the immense asymmetries among nations and between rich and poor. From this very rostrum  President Zelaya urged respect for the human rights of our migrants and the forgotten ones of the Earth — those who draw on the strength of hurricanes from their poverty to produce wealth to which they hardly ever have access and that does not relieve the anguish caused by their unsatisfied needs.   Our constitutional President  José Manuel Zelaya Rosales  with simple and effective proposals  has always called for a more just and more equitable world that would lighten the burden of the shame created by the existence of the astonishing wealth of a few alongside the outrageous misery of the majority. He has also called for a world of tolerance in which we could exchange opinions  ideas and diverse ways of seeing the world  respecting and cooperating with one another to build a better world.  But today  another fate has forced us to represent our President and our people here. In our country  criminal hordes have made us revisit old issues — ones that we had believed to be mere vestiges from the distant past. Today  from this rostrum  I should like to tell the members of the Assembly that  as I address them  our President is being besieged by military forces at the diplomatic mission of the sisterly Republic of Brazil in Tegucigalpa. He is being threatened  and every moment that passes could bring a tragic outcome that would have a paralysing effect on history and on all Hondurans  all Central Americans and the entire world. As I speak  our President’s life is in peril  and the lives of our people are also in peril.   I should like to prove this to the members of the Assembly. In my hand  I have a telephone with President Manuel Zelaya Rosales on the line. He wishes to address the Assembly and to reclaim his rightful place in the presence of the members of the international community. Here  with them  is our leader  our President  the hero of democracy  which he is defending today with his life alongside our people.  President Zelaya (spoke in Spanish via telephone): Greetings to the United Nations. For those who had any doubt that a dictatorship was being installed here  I believe that all that has occurred during the past 93 days of repression have dispelled   45 09-52604  those doubts. In Honduras  in addition to a coup d’état having taken place  a fascist dictatorship has been installed that has suppressed the freedoms of Hondurans and is violently repressing the Honduran people.   Today  the broadcast frequencies used by the only two media outlets opposed to the dictatorship — a national radio station  Radio Globo  and a national television network  Channel 36 — have been shut down  their offices invaded and their transmission equipment confiscated. Surely  a serious crime is being committed when the voice of the people is silenced — a people that is being suppressed.   I ask the United Nations for cooperation to restore the rule of law and the freedom that Hondurans deserve. I ask the United Nations for support  so that the civilized nations of the world can continue to stand firm against force and barbarity. I also ask the United Nations to give us guarantees for our own personal integrity and the lives of those being besieged with chemical gases and electronic interference at this diplomatic facility of the sisterly Republic of Brazil. With great courage  President Lula is demonstrating his interest by supporting democracy and fighting against coups d’état. I ask the United Nations for its support to reverse this coup d’état  so that democracy will really be an asset of all civilized societies throughout the world.  Ms. Rodas (Honduras) (spoke in Spanish): Our President is surrounded and isolated by military forces. The Embassy of the Republic of Brazil is under threat of invasion. We have heard the forceful call of President José Manuel Zelaya Rosales  and we are here to tell the Assembly about the scale and the terrible impact of the repression being visited on our people today.   Free transit through airports and land borders has been halted. A state of emergency has been decreed  with the indefinite suspension of absolutely every constitutional guarantee. In addition  independent news media have been shut down  destroyed and dismantled and their operators persecuted  and two journalists were tortured today in our country. Women have been raped during demonstrations  and sport centres have been turned into concentration camps in Tegucigalpa and other cities.   Honduras is becoming an enormous prison camp. They have imprisoned national journalists and expelled international media. Furthermore  the entire country is militarized. There are constant reports that highly dangerous hired assassins are being freed from prison  as military contingents move forward and mass around the place where our President is now located  together with his family  officials of the Embassy of the sisterly Republic of Brazil  journalists  priests and a large group of people who are accompanying him. We have made major efforts together  inside and outside of Honduras  aimed at enabling our country to regain its constitutional rights  which were forcibly taken from it just three months ago to the day. We have done this  convinced that it will benefit not only Honduras  but the entire world  where there are still people fighting for freedom and self-determination  so as not to be punished for their ideological differences or for their efforts to improve society and transform the economy  so that our peoples may finally look forward to a brighter future with greater possibility.   Our countries  our peoples deserve this  because they have fought their entire lives — first against conquest  then against colonization  then against the major differences created by economic dependency; and today  we continue to fight peacefully and without weapons for our democratic freedoms. Our only weapon is the truth we carry in our hearts  which we have openly expressed to the world.   In the meantime  while we are faced with all of this  our President is being punished for trying to give more freedom and more well-being to our people and for joining in the concert of nations to ensure that our diversity and ways of thinking are viewed as equal to those of the greater countries of the world. Because no matter how small our economies or populations may be  we deserve no less than any other society. Dreaming the impossible dream makes it possible for us to attain what is indeed possible. But our President  our people  all of Honduran society  the international community and the solidarity that gives life to our struggle are shamefully punished day after day by the weapons and brute force of the regime of putschists  which is quickly transforming itself into a dictatorship in the best tradition of what occurred three and four decades ago on our continent.   There is no civil war in Honduras. There are no armed forces facing each other. There are no subversive groups. Hondurans are people who walk tirelessly. They continued walking forward for 90 days  peacefully  silently and determined  with bravery and    09-52604 46  heroism. And with their silence  children  young people  men  women and the elderly told the world: as long as the Honduran people have the unwavering support of the international community  it will be possible to take back our democratic path — the path we shed blood for throughout our history  until the victory at the ballot boxes  until the guns and cannons were lowered — and now those weapons are raised again with bayonets aimed at our defenceless people. It is a dreadful state of siege: every single conceivable constitutional guarantee has been suspended  which threatens the life of every Honduran man and woman every night and every day.   But every day  tirelessly  our people come out to the street and march in small groups  large groups or in masses. They mobilize in whatever way they can around their houses  their blocks  their neighbourhoods or on big plazas. It does not matter how they do it; wherever they are  they mobilize actively. They put their feet on the ground  on the soil that gave birth to them  and assured of regaining our territory — with freedom and democracy — they do not feel tired  they simply walk  as Gandhi did a long time ago and as our migrants and poor have done thousands of times to harvest their simple everyday sustenance.   In this way our people do not use their energy for violence. They are determined to conquer the world by force of will alone  without raising a gun or shooting a single round  even if they risk joining the ranks of the dead  or being tortured or jailed. The brutal coup d’état expelled our President  persecuted his Cabinet and kidnapped his Minister  but finds itself humiliated under the feet of a people who walk their way around the world every day. Their steps cross imaginary bridges to all of the countries of the world  and the world responds with its solidarity.  But  we have been able to present many shared efforts inside and outside our country  including mediation initiatives that have arisen with the aim of implementing resolutions of this General Assembly  such as resolution 63/301 of 30 June 2009  in which the Government of putschists was repudiated and the only constitutional president of Honduras was recognized to be José Manuel Zelaya Rosales. Forums for dialogue have been created  along with efforts at mediation such as the San Jose Agreement  all of which have been systematically rejected by the intransigent putschist regime  which causes those efforts to fail  even when the world attempts to revive those efforts every day.   Those who wished to join the constitutional President have been replaced and prevented from returning to the country  even though they wanted to find the path to reconciliation. Ambassadors who were summoned for consultations following the military coup d’état cannot return to the country without first bowing to the boots of the military who are trampling on our country today.  All of these initiatives  as important and essential as they are in attempting to give strength to the struggle of my people  all of the efforts of the international community in searching for rational  peaceful solutions have made it clear that we are facing forces that are able to unleash the most perverse  form of violence and irrationality. Civilization is  being brought to a halt by barbarism there in Central America — in the centre of Central America — that narrow strip that joins the two halves of our hemisphere.  Given this new situation in which the President’s return unleashed the fury of the dictators  the initiatives needed in order to find a solution today call for specific actions to be taken: the tyrant and the military must be forced to step back. The military forces who disobeyed their President and oppressed their own people have become an occupying army — irregular forces serving only to repress and oppress. They uphold the executory arm of a coup d’état that found its support in a sector of the powerful  old economic class  which is responsible for crushing  exploiting and stripping bare our people and has done so throughout our history.   That is why  in those new conditions  when we need strength to consolidate the proposals and assemble global intelligence and the feeling of a continental home in the midst of the conspiracy of the imminent danger that today confronts not only our President  an embassy and a diplomatic mission the inviolability of which is threatened  but also  in fact  our humble people who walk  who at any moment can be assassinated  imprisoned or tortured; at this time when we hear that military units are moving towards the Embassy of Brazil to continue attacking our President  I appeal to this Assembly. With the authority derived from our peaceful and heroic people and with the moral authority of those who resist the bullets with   47 09-52604  their bodies and flesh  we fervently but resolutely call on the United Nations and its highest bodies to use the strength of their authority to avert and ward off the danger that hovers over Honduras. It is increasingly imminent  ever closer and more and more terrifying. We can avert that danger together with the will and solidarity garnered so far  but with resolute joint actions that will succeed in pushing back that shame.  I must say that  first of all  we must demand respect for the life of our President  his physical and moral integrity and the dignity of his high office. That gives our people strength and determination because we are and wish to be a sovereign  free and independent republic with a solid lasting democracy that will also help make the injustices and inequalities subside. We must also request unconditional support for the dialogue that our President began once he had entered the country unarmed and peacefully so as to be able to sit with the different sectors of Honduran society and thereby open the way to restoring trust  reconciliation and the fabric of the Constitution  because all that depends on reinstating the constitutional President of the Republic of Honduras  José Manuel Zelaya Rosales.   It is also important to bolster efforts to set specific dates  precise mechanisms  ultimatums and frameworks for action to be signed by the body for dialogue and mediation that has been set up  and those that may emerge in its support  to restore peace to our people and to continue building the path of transformation. Furthermore  we must say that as long as there are no constitutional guarantees  a permanent state of siege is imposed on our people and citizen rights are absent  the conditions to prepare free  transparent and universal elections do not exist.  The international community has spoken out by not recognizing that regime of the coup or those Governments or regimes that arose from spurious elections launched into history by cannon or at the point of a bayonet. We therefore urge this General Assembly to call an urgent extraordinary session of the Assembly to keep under review the situation developing in Honduras  that country so close to this land and all countries of the world  neighbour of the Panama Canal and at the centre of all America  so as to be able to keep monitoring the pace of events and  of course  the necessary resources to urgently respond to relieving whatever needs arise there.  It is important that the vital issues that we have presented here be addressed at that Assembly  but it is even more important and more urgent that we urge the Secretary-General of the United Nations to appoint an urgent special diplomatic mission  comprised of the various countries that make up this world forum  to go as soon as possible and pay a working visit to Honduras. It can assess in situ the situation prevailing there and help seek solutions for the region  together with our President  in conjunction with the efforts of the Organization of American States (OAS). The OAS special missions sent to Honduras to prepare a meeting of its Secretary-General with other foreign ministers was recently expelled from the territory.  Thirdly  we should impress on this Assembly and its appropriate authority the need for it to continue analysing and constantly review the situation of violence and the danger of violation of the Vienna Conventions  which prevail over everything pertaining to the inviolability of diplomatic missions and the upholding of international law. For the lives of our President and of our entire people  the consideration  review  analysis and ongoing attention of the Security Council is essential in order to find formulas to avert a greater tragedy that later  once out of control  we could not address.  To conclude  I must state here that  with the awareness of and support for the presence of our President  José Manuel Zelaya Rosales  in our land — in the country where he was elected President by a large majority in free and democratic elections  which today makes him the leader and hero in defending the democratic rights of our peoples — the need to restore to José Manuel Zelaya Rosales to his functions as President of the Republic is more urgent than ever  so that he can take on the duties bestowed on him by our Republic’s constitution and the sovereign mandate of our people. Right now  tonight and in the days following  the leaders of the coup should be urged to respect the life of our President and the inviolability of Brazilian territory in Honduras in its diplomatic mission.  We must not neglect this grave political and institutional crisis  a crisis that affects the entire world and democracy around the globe. I therefore request that the Secretary-General present to the special session of the General Assembly a report analysing compliance with resolution 63/301  and resolutions that might stem from it  for a return to constitutional rule     09-52604 48  the restoration of our President  ending violence and repression and violations of the international law  for a return to international peace and concord  to our people’s freedom to hold elections without the constant threat of violence and coups d’état  and  finally  for respect for human life. The most humble may not be known to the international community  but every night their lives are in danger under the skies of our country.  We declare our solidarity with all those suffering from lack of freedom and of democracy  from lack of development  from poverty and inequality  those suffering from a lack of respect for the freedom that every society must have to organize itself as best it can  without being attacked  blockaded or  much less  expelled from any international entity. I express the solidarity of Honduras with those people suffering from discrimination and despoliation and those whose hope is crushed beneath the terror of military force  and our bottomless gratitude for the solidarity expressed by the entire international community. In an extraordinary  unprecedented way  they joined hands and forgot their profound differences to unite with our people and jointly confront this crime  which  in the twenty-first century  has once again stained our democracies.  We give our thanks for the prayers and the solidarity of all the peoples of the world  to those who accompany us daily on the long road back to democracy  and to those who will never forget the words of our President calling out for respect for life  integrity and freedom of speech  and that never again will this sad story of persecution and death be perpetrated against an innocent  unarmed and peaceful people.  These  then  are the initiatives I have set out. Along with that I express our gratitude to all peoples of the world  representatives of whom fit into this small space  just as all the freedom and the hope of democracy of the entire world fits into that tiny country of Honduras."
"74",3033,"HRV",64,2009,"We have assembled once again to discuss the situation in the world  outline the problems our countries face and present our views on the world we live in. The President of the General Assembly has offered a topic for discussion  one which  I would say  perfectly reflects current circumstances and the tasks arising from them.  What kind of world are we discussing here? A globalized world? By all means. An interconnected and interdependent world? Without any doubt. A world of great discrepancies and major threats? Certainly. In brief  our world is such that there are practically no longer regional problems and crises  since each and every issue  no matter how much it may appear to be regional  reveals itself as global in terms of its consequences.  Our world is still dominated by developed and most developed countries; while developing countries are desperately lagging behind  struggling with hunger  the inability to educate their citizens and the lack of even the most basic health care. Can we be content with such a world? Without any hesitation  I respond that  no  we cannot.   In our world there are many States as well as groups that are united in their inclination to use terror as a means of action and to resort to force to achieve their goals. Admittedly  confrontation between the blocs no longer exists. A balance of fear between super-Powers is non-existent  but our world has hardly become more secure  while peace has hardly become more stable. Can we be content with such a world? Again  without any hesitation  I respond that  no  we cannot.  Our world is ultimately still dominated by an economic model that is self-evidently exhausted and has now reached a stage where it is itself generating crises and causing hardship to millions of people. If one attempts to save that already obsolete model at any cost  and if one stubbornly defends a system based on greed and devoid of any social value worth    09-52425 50  mentioning  there can be only one result: social unrest harbouring the potential to erupt into social insurgence on a global scale.  Can we accept such prospects? I respond with the utmost resolution that  no  we cannot  and must not. It is up to us to embark now upon the enormous task of creating a new world order — not returning to anything that existed before  but creating something new: an order that will in the end provide a life worthy of humankind for each person and equal chances for all  and not one that writes off those who are in dire need through no fault of their own and those who at the end of their lives are viewed as useless and therefore unworthy of any support.  It is up to us to dispel prejudices more resolutely than ever before  to stand up to discrimination on whatever grounds  to say no to intolerance and to promote not only the idea but also the practice of multilateralism and dialogue among civilizations. That is the only way towards building global peace  security and development as vital preconditions for lasting and stable peace.  Fortunately  the world has emerged from a potentially very dangerous period of unipolarism and is now on a path towards multipolarism. However  the world is still in the process of learning that only dialogue can help us to build mutual trust and understanding. It is not yet ready to face the fact that it is not a crime to be different and that our future can be found only in unity through diversity — of course  under the condition of full equality and strict observance of human rights and in line with the United Nations conventions.   With the simultaneous drift from unipolarism and a shift towards multipolarism  we have to understand and accept that though we have established a set of universal values  we have not  will not and cannot establish a single model of social and economic relations applicable to all. The specific features of individual nations and civilizations must be respected  since there is no reason why anyone should renounce something that is part of his cultural or traditional heritage.  Finally  a world characterized by international peace  security and development is not possible without disarmament  in particular without renouncing nuclear weapons. This was the topic of my address in the Security Council this morning. I would like to mention in addition the notorious fact that problems of development would become minor if the huge funds currently allocated for armament were channelled into development.  I reiterate: the task before us is enormous. Let us show courage and political will to grapple with it. The Republic of Croatia  although a small country  is ready to make its contribution. Although my ten-year term is nearing its end and this is the last time I stand at this rostrum  I will just say that I shall continue to place my skills at the service of achieving this noble goal."
"75",3078,"HTI",64,2009,"Allow me at the outset to convey my congratulations to the President of the General Assembly and to wish him very fruitful work.  Can you imagine a General Assembly where the representatives of States and Governments who follow one another on this rostrum would bring us only good news  inform us that our world is doing better and that most development indicators are at their best level ever? We are very far indeed from such an ideal.  It would even seem that  in addition to numerous crises of all kinds — food  energy  financial and so forth — that are already exacting a very high toll on our populations  some of us must now get used to recurrent upheavals resulting from natural disasters. Each time  we have to rebuild the same ruined infrastructure; we have to restore the same productive capacities that have been swept away by cyclones and floods. And  for lack of sufficient resources  the reconstruction process is never launched in time. We find we are having to prepare for the return of these disasters even before our communities have recovered from the previous ones. This  evidently  is the new life cycle that vulnerable countries such as ours must be prepared for. With  of course  insufficient resources at their disposal.   39 09-52425   This situation is no accident. It is the direct consequence of a development and governance model that nations recognized as powerful have imposed on the rest of the world for centuries: a development and governance model that is largely concerned with the welfare of money and too little with the welfare of people; a development model that  even in very rich countries  imposes a precarious existence on major sections of the population  which lack health care  decent housing and even a good education.  Why should the whole of humankind accept that half the inhabitants of our planet should live with these privations  in hunger and misery  with no prospect of improvement in their situation? Why should the whole of humankind accept that our planet should be endangered irresponsibly  that species should be condemned to extinction or that  through climate change  our populations should become more vulnerable to natural disasters merely because of selfish economic choices by a small minority of polluters?  What substance can we give to our membership in this human community that the United Nations seeks to champion? To paraphrase George Orwell  beyond a certain level of inequality  there is no common world anymore. The glaring inequalities that characterize our countries’ situations are an obstacle to the formation of the great family that the United Nations should be.  The time has come to oppose the globalization of profit at any price  which has become the new credo  and to replace it with the globalization of solidarity  which alone will ensure the eradication of poverty  as required by this Assembly.   Here  I should reiterate to members that the true vehicle for peace  stability and security is development. The aid received by our countries will be ineffective and a source of great frustration for donors and beneficiaries unless it is part of a plan to create and develop the productive potential of our countries. That is the only way to put an end to the cycle of poverty and dependence.  Haitians  like many other peoples of the South  are a hardworking  clever and entrepreneurial people equipped with great resilience forged by dealing with daily setbacks and able to utilize to the extreme and optimize the scant resources made available to them. Our peoples yearn to mobilize that potential and that capacity to take the path of sustainable development.   Developing our countries is thus a possible endeavour. However  all the efforts under way could remain ineffective unless we are able to develop a new paradigm for international cooperation — a paradigm requiring that we transcend the logic of human assistance and recognize the capacity of poor peoples to engage in business and produce wealth  using the means and opportunities afforded them to strengthen their productive capacity. Without such a new vision  which breaks with the culture of perpetual humanitarian assistance  peace and stability will remain precarious and fleeting achievements.   Permit me to add a few words about Haiti  because my country is the focus of particular attention by the Security Council. Over the past three years  despite the negative effects of numerous international crises on our economy  significant progress has been made  in particular in the areas of security  respect for human rights  the investment climate  eliminating corruption and building a friendly society in which dialogue occupies a central place  supported and reported on by totally free and independent media. That progress must be deepened and expanded. That is why United Nations support is necessary for us.   In his report to the Security Council  the Secretary-General recommended that the mandate of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) be extended for another year. That proposal is most welcome  and we fully endorse it. We are convinced that the right balance among its military  police and administrative components will best place MINUSTAH to assist our country more effectively in consolidating an atmosphere of peace and stability  without making it indifferent to our struggle to rebuild and to reduce poverty and vulnerability. I thank the Secretary-General for having chosen Bill Clinton as his Special Envoy to our country. I also thank the former President  a friend of Haiti  for having agreed to help us.   Many summits organized under United Nations auspices produce resolutions and commitments that are consigned to oblivion or indifference when the time comes to implement them. It is our shared responsibility to work to ensure that this general debate is not pure ritual in which  from this lofty rostrum  we use rhetoric to share our ideas about major international issues  express our good intentions  make tempting promises and leave again without any real    09-52425 40  desire to take appropriate measures to keep our commitments.   For example  will we accept the fact that the President of Honduras  José Manuel Zelaya  legitimately elected by his people  has been deposed by the military and that the many resolutions adopted by various regional organizations condemning that coup d’état remain dead letters? Similarly  every year for more than 15 years now  the General Assembly has adopted a resolution condemning the embargo against the Cuban people. The continuation of that embargo runs counter to all the values that we promote to make international trade a tool for human development. When will rhetoric be replaced by action?"
"76",3124,"HUN",64,2009,"Allow me at the outset to congratulate the President on his assumption of the high post of the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. In fulfilling his challenging tasks during this session  he may rest assured of the support and cooperation of the delegation of the Republic of Hungary.  The current session of the General Assembly begins its work against the backdrop of an extraordinary downturn of the world economy. Hungary was among those countries which were especially hard hit by the storm of the current financial and economic crisis. In order to cope with its consequences  the Hungarian Government has adopted and implemented a series of stabilization measures. As a result of this policy  the first positive trends have already emerged. Today we can claim that the Hungarian economy is well on its way towards recovery and that the foundations of a more sustainable development have been laid. If implemented vigorously  the strict fiscal policy of my Government will put the country back into the ranks of the financially stable economies.  At the same time  Hungary cannot and does not want to turn a blind eye to the plight of millions worldwide  especially the most vulnerable ones in the developing world  particularly in Africa  who have been thrown into poverty as a consequence of the global economic crisis. The present crisis should not undermine our common efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. Hungary continues to take its share of responsibility by implementing its donor programmes in Afghanistan  Viet Nam and the neighbouring middle-income countries of the Western Balkans.  Global crises require that we all think and act together in the spirit of shared responsibility. It is right that climate change is high on the United Nations agenda  as it threatens the very foundations of our life. Yet for too long we failed to respond adequately. Hungary is willing to accept its share of responsibility and is fully committed to achieving important results at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen. In this regard  the summit on climate change recently convened by the Secretary-General was a useful forum in identifying the necessary steps towards a successful outcome.  Preventing conflicts and managing crises remain high on our agenda. The United Nations  in cooperation with regional organizations  continues to play a key role in this respect. Full integration of the Western Balkans into European and Euro-Atlantic structures is a means to promote the stability and prosperity of that region  a goal that Hungary supports actively. Interaction among countries of the region to fulfil the conditions of European integration is an essential tool. International efforts in Kosovo represent a good example of effective cooperation among various stakeholders  such as the European Union and NATO.  In Georgia  the situation on the ground remains fragile. We firmly believe that a peaceful and lasting solution to the conflict must be based on full respect for the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of that country within its internationally recognized borders. We deplore the decision that led to the termination of the monitoring activities of the United Nations and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in the breakaway parts of Georgia/Abkhazia and South Ossetia. The resumption    09-52598 44  of the international presence in these regions is necessary.  The stakes in Afghanistan are high. The success of international stabilization and reconstruction efforts will have a major impact both on our security and on the defence of the values our societies stand for. Failure is not an option. Hungary will remain committed to supporting  politically and by contributing troops and civilian and development assistance  the creation of a stable Afghanistan governed by the rule of law. We welcome the joint initiative of the United Kingdom  Germany and France to hold an international conference at the ministerial level  co-chaired by the United Nations and the Afghan Government.  In the Middle East  Hungary warmly welcomes the commitment of the United States to vigorously pursue a two-State solution and a comprehensive peace. It is now up to the parties themselves to engage in a meaningful process of negotiation. It is our responsibility to assist them in carrying the process forward.  The nuclear programme of Iran continues to be a matter of most serious concern. We deeply regret that Iran’s leadership has refused to abide by the relevant Security Council resolutions. In flagrant violation of its international obligations  Iran has even increased its uranium-enrichment capacities. Recent revelations about the existence of a second enrichment facility underscore the legitimacy of our previous concerns. We urge Iran to engage in substantive negotiations on its nuclear programme without further delay. The news of recent missile tests only reinforces our sense of urgency.  The idea of a world without nuclear weapons has long been cherished. We welcome the affirmations of commitment to this goal made at the recent summit-level meeting of the Security Council (see S/PV.6191)  along with the adoption of a comprehensive set of measures to strengthen the global non-proliferation regime. Hungary hopes that the momentum created by that meeting will also have a positive impact on the 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.  The global economic and financial crisis has affected the political landscape in many countries and has led to the re-emergence of extreme nationalist  racist and xenophobic ideologies and political movements. Like many other countries  Hungary is not immune from this phenomenon. We cannot allow those alarming trends to prevail or to roll back the advance of democratic values and human rights. The Government of Hungary condemns  in the most resolute terms  all forms of racism  anti-Semitism and xenophobia and fights any manifestation of them not only in words  but also in deeds.  The promotion and protection of human rights  including the rights of national minorities and the preservation of their cultural and linguistic identities  have traditionally been high on the agenda of the Hungarian Government. The presence of flourishing minority communities does not weaken a State  but rather makes it stronger. Trust between the majority and minorities within a country can be built only on that basis. The Republic of Hungary attaches great importance to the work of the United Nations Forum on Minority Issues and is determined to contribute actively to the Forum’s second meeting  to be held this November in Geneva. We are witnessing alarming tendencies that have a detrimental effect on the political participation  cultural life and educational opportunities of minorities. The international community should pay special attention to respect for minority rights.  At this point  I would also like to confirm the commitment of Hungary  as a newly elected member of the Human Rights Council  to play an active role in the most important human rights body of the United Nations. We strongly believe that there is a clear and urgent need for further institution-building in the field of the prevention of genocide and mass atrocities. For that reason  this year Hungary prepared a feasibility study on the establishment of the Budapest Centre for the International Prevention of Genocide and Mass Atrocities. It is envisaged that the Centre will work in close cooperation with the United Nations  including the Office of the Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide and Mass Atrocities and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.  The ongoing changes in international politics and the world economy have created a new situation for the United Nations. We welcome and strongly support the efforts aimed at strengthening the ability of the Organization to adapt to the new realities  but we cannot be satisfied with the pace of the transformation. The present challenges should lend additional impetus to moving forward more vigorously on such issues as   45 09-52598  Security Council reform  peacekeeping activities  system-wide coherence  budgeting of the Organization  management reform and reform of the environmental governance system of the United Nations. With a view to actively promoting those goals  Hungary presented its candidacies for the Security Council for the term 2012-2013 and for the Economic and Social Council for the term 2011-2013.  Once again the United Nations stands at a crossroads. It needs to adapt to the changing international environment. This change will require sacrifices  but it also offers new opportunities as it paves the way for new consensus on the future of the United Nations."
"77",3171,"IDN",64,2009,"We meet today while the world is in the grip of intertwined crises from which we must break free if we are to ensure our long-term survival. The most urgent of these is the economic and financial crisis. It has put scores of millions out of jobs  shut down tens of thousands of factories  and pushed more than 100 million people below the poverty line.  A few days ago  at the Group of Twenty (G-20) summit in Pittsburgh  the 20 largest economies of the world  both developed and developing  addressed this crisis by agreeing to reform the global financial architecture to meet the needs of the twenty-first century. No longer will we depend on just a few industrialized nations to solve the world’s economic problems. The developing world is now part of the solution to those problems. Through the G-20  the voice of the developing world will be heard in international economic and financial decision-making.  Thus  we are building today a new and constructive power equation  increasing the sharing of responsibilities and contributions and widening participation in decision-making. This redistribution of power constitutes fundamental reform that should be replicated in other bodies  such as the Security Council. And no more will our economies be left to the mercy of the market. Financial institutions and instruments will have to be regulated and closely supervised. There will be close consultations and mutual assessments of national economic strategies in order to ensure coordination at the global level and to identify potential risks to financial stability.  For our part in Indonesia we are working hard in the G-20 to reform the mandate  mission and governance of the International Monetary Fund and our multilateral development banks. These banks must deliver accelerated and concessional financing without conditionalities to the low-income countries so as to cushion the impact of the crisis on the most vulnerable and the poorest.  All of this has set refreshing precedents in terms of access to financial resources for developing countries and in terms of transparency  and most importantly  it reflects current global realities rather than the world of 60 years ago. As such  it represents a democratization of the global economy and the international financial architecture. It has also given us a remarkable insight: that it is not an array of disparate crises that is confronting us. We are actually in the grip of one systemic crisis. The economic and financial crisis  the challenge of climate change  the food security crisis and the energy security crisis are problems that fed on one another and thus grew to critical proportions. That reality materialized because the international community failed to form an effective global partnership to address the large bundle of challenges that have ultimately affected all humankind.  In that sense  the root cause of this overarching crisis is the failure to achieve multilateralism and forge a system of democratic governance at the global level. But we can rectify that failure through an all-encompassing reform of the relationships between nations in the world today.  In December in Copenhagen we can strive to reach a new consensus on climate change that is more effective in averting climate disaster by forging an equitable and transparent partnership between   13 09-53165  developed and developing nations. As the host country to the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Bali  which adopted the Bali Road Map by consensus  Indonesia fervently desires that the Copenhagen meeting will yield a new commitment to a framework to strengthen the Kyoto Protocol in 2012. This framework must stipulate deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions and sufficient financing for adaptation to and mitigation of climate change.  We would like to see the role of forests given the top priority that it deserves. We look forward to ocean issues being mainstreamed into the new climate regime. And we cannot allow the negotiation process to be derailed; the stakes are too high. We need not even wait for a consensus. We are ready to forge partnerships to carry out concrete projects like the Indonesia Forest Carbon Partnership Facility  which by itself is already a contribution to climate stability. In the same spirit  Indonesia is hosting the Forest-2011 ministerial meeting in Jakarta next month.   By the same token  we can launch a more successful and durable Green Revolution that is based on the same kind of partnership and gives developing countries sorely needed access to resources and technology. That partnership can and must provide for the massive investments required for agricultural production and building agricultural infrastructures. When sufficient investment is channelled to agriculture  the result is the productivity that Indonesia has enjoyed in the past several years. We have a surplus production of rice and part of that surplus will become a buffer stock for our national food security. Part of it will be allotted as our contribution to global food security.  Through similar reform we can involve more nations in a coordinated quest for new sources of renewable and clean energy  without compromising food security. A global partnership for energy security rather than a scattering of individual efforts will have a much better chance of achieving a technological breakthrough that will enormously increase the efficiency of current fuel-burning mechanisms.  With this new spirit of reform and multilateralism  we will be able in 2010 to break the impasse in the Doha Round negotiations  which will lead to an outcome that is pro-development. In that same spirit we can tear down the barriers of protectionism that are rising again out of fear of the economic crisis. With trade revitalized  world gross domestic product (GDP) could be bolstered by $700 billion a year.  A global partnership that reforms the international financial architecture  works for climate stability  food security and energy security and brings a successful conclusion to the Doha Development Round should also bring about the fulfilment of the Monterrey Consensus. This will ensure the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals.  If this new spirit of multilateralism and reform can pervade international socio-economic affairs  there is no reason why it should not also find its way into the politico-security field. It can resuscitate the disarmament agenda — especially nuclear disarmament  which has been lying moribund for decades. In a truly democratic world order  the nuclear Powers would fulfil their commitment to the Non-Proliferation Treaty by slashing their nuclear arsenals and abiding by the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. In turn  we non-nuclear countries will continue to refrain from developing nuclear weapons.   This is no longer an impossible dream. A window of opportunity has been opened with the adoption of Security Council resolution 1887 (2009) on the maintenance of international peace and security leading to a nuclear-weapon-free world  and with the current process between the United States and the Russian Federation towards deeper cuts in their respective nuclear arsenals. Thus  the disarmament agenda is being revived.  Even the persistent Middle East conflict  with the question of Palestine at its core  could be more expeditiously resolved  if the task of promoting the peace process involved a wider base of stakeholders. The main problem in reviving the peace process at the moment is the intransigence of Israel on the issue of illegal settlements. But the early engagement of the Obama Administration in the peace effort and its even-handed multilateral approach to the problem brings hope for an eventual two-State solution.  Let us therefore respond to President Obama’s call for partnering for peace. Likewise  the challenge of terrorism demands the broadest possible coalition of nations to put an end to it — not only through sheer force of arms but also and mainly through a dialogue of faiths  cultures and civilizations that will put the merchants of hate out of business.   09-53165 14   Every major problem in the world today calls for the concerted efforts of many nations to work out its solution. This includes transnational challenges like piracy  irregular migration  money-laundering  human rights violations  the threat of a pandemic and natural disasters. All these problems demand reform and strengthening of international cooperation. A clamour for reform that must be heeded now is the call for the overhaul of the composition and workings of the Security Council. For by no means does the Council reflect the realities of our time — it is a throwback to the world at the end of the Second World War.  In the same way that the Group of Eight can no longer solve the economic problems of the world  a Security Council paralysed by its undemocratic composition and the veto system can no longer guarantee our collective security. It needs to be more democratic  transparent and accountable. It needs new sources of strength that the developing world and their ancient civilizations can help provide in the same manner as the inclusivity of the G-20.  We in Indonesia are great believers in democratic reform  because that is what saved us from being totally crushed by the Asian financial crisis of 1997. Over the years until then  we had focused too much on the market and on our GDP growth and thus neglected our political development. The only way out of the crisis was reform — reform of every aspect of our national life. And so we made the transition from a highly centralized authoritarian regime to a decentralized  more fully democratic system. We reformed our military  our bureaucracy and our justice system. We modernized our economic infrastructure.  And since October 2004  the administration of President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has been consolidating and fine-tuning earlier reforms. Now  having won re-election in only the second direct presidential election in our history  he is ready to launch a second wave of reform  which will lay the foundations for Indonesia’s becoming a developed country by 2025. Meanwhile  we have come to be known as the world’s third largest democracy  the land where democracy  Islam and modernization not only go hand in hand but thrive together. We intend to keep on earning and deserving that recognition — by  among other ways  learning from others and sharing with them our experiences in political development.  That is why  last December  we organized the Bali Democracy Forum  Asia’s first intergovernmental forum on democracy. We are making this an annual affair. And it is our hope that the world  as it reforms its economic governance  will learn a truth that we came upon during our crisis some 12 years ago: that prosperity without democracy is but a bubble. And democracy that does not deliver development will not endure. Economic and political development must march hand in hand. As it is with a country such as Indonesia  so it is with the world. It is not enough for the world to get its economics right. It must also get its politics right. For man does not live by bread alone. He must also have his freedom."
"78",3218,"IND",64,2009,"I offer my congratulations to Mr. Treki on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. My delegation assures him of our fullest cooperation during his stewardship of this Assembly  which embodies the hopes  aspirations and shared vision of peace and development of all the peoples of our planet.  When this session of the General Assembly ends next year  the United Nations will have completed 65 years of existence. These past decades have seen the world change in fundamental ways. Connectivity defines our global condition  and the challenges that we collectively face are truly global. The resolution of these challenges  as we are aware  requires global approaches and solutions. What may happen in one part of the world has an impact on other regions. In the context of these rapidly emerging changes and their deep and diverse effects  we must consider more deeply whether the United Nations and other global governance structures are geared to effectively meeting the challenges that confront us all.  It is of concern that  even after more than six decades of existence  our international governance structures are neither inclusive nor participatory. Consequently  these structures and institutions have not kept pace or evolved with the changed nature  intensity and depth of contemporary global issues. The question is therefore: Are these institutions able to address these challenges adequately or satisfactorily? The reform and restructuring of the global governance architecture are the critical needs of our times  and the voices of the developing world  including those of the small island nations and Africa  are of principal and core relevance if we are to have truly participatory and global responses to global challenges.    09-52592 28   One need not look very far to identify these challenges. The current economic and financial turmoil  which did not begin in the developing world  has affected developing countries the most. Growth has slowed  with recession overtaking many countries. The international response to this challenge must consist not only of the measures that have been taken to stimulate economies  but also  more importantly  of finding ways to restructure the current international governance system  which has failed to respond to the virulence of the financial and economic crisis.  To gloss over this structural deficit of the current global financial and economic architecture would imperil the future of a vast majority of the peoples of this world and presage greater difficulties in the future. In the face of the current economic and financial crisis  hard-won gains in alleviating poverty  hunger  illiteracy and disease are being reversed. The achievements of the Millennium Development Goals are seriously threatened. Policies of protectionism under such already adverse circumstances will exacerbate the serious situation that many countries face.  It is imperative that the United Nations act in concert to coherently overcome these challenges. India  which is actively engaged in the Group of 20 and other processes  has always stressed that developing countries must receive priority in any global response to the crisis. The United Nations Conference on the Financial and Economic Crisis held in June was opportune and provided a useful platform for collectively seeking ways and means to respond to the crisis. We now look forward to early implementation during the course of this General Assembly of the follow-up measures agreed on at the Conference.  At the centre stage of multilateralism and international cooperation is the United Nations. This Organization is a platform on which the world meets to express views and undertake commitments on global issues of mutual concern on an equal footing. It is no wonder  then  that the Charter of the United Nations begins with the inspiring words “We the peoples of the United Nations”. Inclusiveness and collective action in all aspects of the work of the Organization are at the heart of its Charter. This vision must be our lodestar  the guiding principle of all we undertake. India is committed to working with Member States to make the United Nations more relevant and attuned to contemporary realities.   Reforming the United Nations is a matter of the highest priority. Four years after the 2005 World Summit  there has not been much progress even as newer and more global crises and problems have emerged. We should not let slowness of action weaken the Organization in the face of such challenges. Rather  we must work in concert to make it more robust and capable of effective response.  Reform in the three essentials of the Charter — peace and security  development and human rights — requires our collective attention. The General Assembly must be revitalized in full measure  and its role as the anvil of global deliberation must be strengthened. The Economic and Social Council must become the fulcrum of development. It must be accepted that the Security Council must be strengthened and made more representative by expanding its permanent and non-permanent membership. Ongoing intergovernmental negotiations during the past six months have unambiguously established that an overwhelming majority of Member States share the perspective that an expansion in both categories of Security Council membership is needed.  Climate change is one of the most important global challenges that we face today. Developing countries bear a disproportionate share of its adverse effects  even though they are not responsible for it. Cognizant of the serious threat that climate change poses  India is engaged in the ongoing negotiations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)  including at the upcoming Copenhagen Conference. India will work for an outcome that recognizes the development imperatives of developing countries and is rooted in the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities.  We also must move away from concentrating on mitigation only and ensure that there is a focus on adaptation  which is critical for developing countries. We are hosting a high-level global conference on “Climate Change: Technology Development and Transfer” on 22 and 23 October 2009  in cooperation with the United Nations. The objective of the conference is to help formulate a road map for technology in the context of climate change mitigation and adaptation to support the UNFCCC process.  Developing countries must be supported financially  technologically and with capacity-building   29 09-52592  resources so that they can cope with the immense challenges of adaptation. Special efforts are required to develop programmes that address the critical needs of small island States and of the most vulnerable countries.  Poverty alleviation and livelihood security are central imperatives for India. To that end  accelerated economic growth and energy security are critical drivers. In pursuing our development goals  India has been successful in significantly reducing its energy intensity. India will continue to pursue that path.  India is aware that the continuing volatility in the fossil-fuel markets  together with the threat of climate change  makes the development of all renewable and clean energy sources — including nuclear energy — crucial. In that context  international civil-nuclear cooperation is important.  India has also taken several independent initiatives to address the issue of climate change. We have put in place a comprehensive policy and legislative framework  as well as a national action plan on climate change with eight separate national missions. An unprecedented afforestation campaign has been launched with a doubling of the forestry budget this year to $1.3 billion  and this increase is going to be sustained every year. The Prime Minister’s Council has approved national missions for enhanced energy efficiency and solar energy  setting ambitious goals. We are supporting and facilitating major research to assess various aspects related to climate change.  India attaches the highest priority to the goal of nuclear disarmament and has an impeccable non-proliferation record. We welcome the renewed global debate on achieving a world free of nuclear weapons. That corresponds with India’s long-standing and consistent advocacy of nuclear disarmament as one of the highest priorities of the international community. We have put forward a number of proposals on nuclear disarmament at the United Nations  including a working paper in 2006 proposing elements to fashion a new consensus on disarmament and non-proliferation.  Last year  at the sixty-third session of the General Assembly  consistent with India’s long-standing commitment as articulated in the Rajiv Gandhi Action Plan in 1988  India reiterated its proposal that a nuclear weapons convention be convened to ban the production  development  stockpiling and use of nuclear weapons and to provide for their complete elimination within a time frame. The international nuclear order cannot be discriminatory. Further  States must fulfil the obligations that they have undertaken. Once more  with feeling and with commitment  India reiterates that proposal.  We will continue to engage with key countries to intensify this debate in the hope that greater international understanding will lend itself to a firm commitment to action on nuclear disarmament. It was in that spirit that we supported the adoption of a programme of work  including on a fissile material cut-off treaty (FMCT)  at the Conference on Disarmament in May this year. It is consistent with India’s position to work with others at the Conference on Disarmament towards the conclusion of a non-discriminatory  multilaterally negotiated and internationally verifiable FMCT  provided it corresponds with India’s national security interests. We remain committed to a voluntary  unilateral moratorium on nuclear testing.   India stands committed to the safeguarding of international peace and security. Over the past five decades  we have contributed more than 100 000 peacekeepers and have suffered a high number of casualties during this time. Strengthening the normative basis for peacekeeping operations and giving major troop-contributing countries a greater say will serve to make peacekeeping more effective.  Peace  security  stability and the welfare of our neighbourhood are vital for India. There is a new beginning in Sri Lanka; in Nepal  strengthening the peace process is in our collective interest; and in Afghanistan  the international community must remain intensively engaged and support its development efforts and the maintenance of peace and stability. India is committed to establishing good-neighbourly relations and resolving all outstanding issues with Pakistan through peaceful dialogue.  The barbaric terrorist attack on the innocent people of Mumbai on 26 November 2008 reminded us of the daily and malignant menace that terrorism poses to all countries. There can be no justification whatsoever for such mindless terrorist acts. It is our collective responsibility and duty to work together to ensure that terrorists and the organizers  perpetrators and supporters of such crimes are brought to justice.  In order to strengthen the international legal framework of the fight against terrorism  India has proposed a comprehensive convention on international    09-52592 30  terrorism. Discussions on the draft have gone on for far too long. It is time that the convention be finally adopted. India earnestly calls upon all countries to make serious efforts in the next few weeks to arrive at a consensus on the text.  In conclusion  I wish to reiterate India’s steadfast commitment to the work of the United Nations. Speaking to this Assembly 41 years ago  Prime Minister Indira Gandhi said:    “The United Nations is the trustee of the world’s peace and represents the hopes of mankind. Its very existence gives a feeling of assurance that the justice of true causes can be brought fearlessly before the world. This Assembly and the agencies of the United Nations should  in all that they do  sustain those hopes and promote the causes of peace.” (A/PV.1693  para. 150)  The truth and conviction of these words are more meaningful today than ever before."
"79",3264,"IRL",64,2009,"Let me begin  Mr. President  by warmly congratulating you on your election and extending the best wishes of the Irish Government and the Irish people for a successful term in office.  It is indeed a very great honour to participate in this general debate and to share this unique global platform. Ireland cherishes its membership in the United Nations. We believe strongly in the purposes  the principles and the potential of this great global Organization of ours. And we are proud of the role we have ourselves played in developing that potential over the past five decades. We are determined to maintain this role and to remain steadfastly at the service of the United Nations.  Rarely have the challenges facing the global community been as formidable  or as pressing  as those of today. And rarely has the need been greater for collective action and for the facilitating framework that is uniquely provided by the United Nations. Our discussions in New York over the past week have highlighted some of the most urgent issues on the Organization’s agenda at present  including climate change  global poverty and hunger  and nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.  We are also confronted with the global financial and economic crisis — the most severe in a generation — which is leaving its mark on every family and community across the world. Governments everywhere are facing a daunting task  as they work to mitigate the effects of global recession and economic turbulence and to limit the impact of the crisis on those in greatest need. Once again  the United Nations provides a framework for the development of collective responses and solutions.  The summit of world leaders hosted by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in New York last week on climate change displayed the strength of international commitment on this issue. The Secretary-General has been a powerful advocate of collective action to tackle this major threat to our planet and our future generations. It now falls to us  the Member States  to redouble our efforts to ensure a successful outcome to the Copenhagen Conference in December.  The promise that the United Nations embodies to tackle all these global threats can only be realized through continuing efforts to make this a stronger and more effective Organization. Ireland has played  and will continue to play  an active role in championing the reform agenda at the United Nations.  In the area of system-wide coherence  the reform agenda is already producing good results and helping to deliver a more effective and relevant United Nations. The One United Nations Initiative is delivering improved development performance at the individual country level. Ireland warmly welcomes the progress being made in the General Assembly and  in particular  the recent decision to establish a new gender entity to promote gender equality. I encourage early action to make the new entity operational during the Assembly’s current session.  The need for greater progress on other parts of the United Nations reform agenda still remains. A positive start has been made to the intergovernmental negotiations on Security Council reform. But more urgency is required in transforming the Council to make it more representative and reflective of twenty-first century realities  as well as to improve its functioning and increase its transparency.  I would like to devote some time today to discussing the critical issue — indeed the scandal — that is hunger in our world today. Tonight  over one billion people will go to bed hungry and malnourished. That is one in seven people inhabiting the planet today. This scandal represents perhaps the biggest collective failure of mankind. In the last few days — during the past week in the General Assembly — world leaders have come together to discuss the most complex and    09-52604 4  daunting of global challenges  including climate change and non-proliferation. Yet  the simple challenge of putting food into the mouths of everybody on the planet still remains beyond us.   I speak today as the representative of a country that has experienced famine and hunger and whose population was decimated by the Great Famine in Ireland in 1847. A year ago this week I accompanied our Prime Minister — our Taoiseach — here to the United Nations Headquarters to present to Secretary-General Ban the report of our Hunger Task Force. The key recommendation in that report was a call for global leadership to tackle hunger. I was therefore greatly encouraged last Saturday to see such leadership by Secretary-General Ban and United States Secretary of State Clinton aimed at constructing a road map to translate rhetoric and commitment on hunger into real action — and real action on the ground. The Global Partnership for Agriculture and Food Security initiative holds the promise of contributing to a world free from chronic hunger.  It is clear what we must do. We must tackle hunger in a comprehensive way and address the fundamental causes of hunger. We need to invest in agriculture and agricultural research and  in particular  to support women farmers. We need to invest in rural infrastructure  enhance nutrition and support national and regional plans. Ireland has placed food security and related sectors as a cornerstone of our aid programme. By 2012 we will ensure that 20 per cent of our aid programme is hunger-focused. We are well on our way to meeting this objective. But above all we need  at a global level  to summon the political will to end this scandal. Nothing short of the complete eradication of hunger on the planet should satisfy us.   Peacekeeping and the maintenance of international peace and security have always been central to the role of the United Nations. Ireland is deeply proud of the long-standing contribution that we have made to United Nations peacekeeping operations across the world. For over half a century  there has been a continuous tradition of Irish peacekeepers serving the cause of peace under the United Nations blue flag somewhere in the world. This goes to the very heart of our commitment to the United Nations and the values it represents — a commitment that is  I should say  an integral part of our foreign policy and that helps to define us as a nation.  It is clear  however  that both the Organization and contributing countries are being severely stretched in terms of the demands made by a steadily escalating number of peace support operations around the world. The Secretary-General’s paper  “A New Partnership Agenda: Charting a New Horizon for United Nations Peacekeeping”  is therefore a very welcome initiative  and we look forward to contributing to its early consideration by the General Assembly.  Regional organizations  such as the European Union and the African Union  play a vital role in helping the United Nations to fulfil its peacekeeping responsibilities. As the Secretary-General acknowledged when he visited Dublin last July  without the unique contributions of regional organizations such as the European Union  United Nations operations would not be able to achieve their goals and could  in fact  fail entirely. The successful transition earlier this year from the European Union-led force in Chad and the Central African Republic (EUFOR) to the United Nations Mission there shows how important and effective this partnership has become  as does the similarly successful transition to the European Union Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo.  In Ireland we have known the terrible human cost of conflict. The Irish Government has been developing over the past years a focus on conflict resolution work  building on our own practical experiences with the Northern Ireland peace process.  Complementing the work of others  especially the United Nations  we hope that we may be able to make a distinctive contribution to conflict resolution efforts in other parts of the world. As one example  we are engaging actively in Timor-Leste  using lessons derived from our own peace process to help increase confidence in policing and security arrangements in that country. I am also proud that  in relation to Security Council resolution 1325 (2000)  the Irish Government is sponsoring a major lessons-learned exercise involving interactions between women from Timor-Leste  Liberia and Northern Ireland.  Building peace and ending conflict cannot be accomplished without also removing the very means of conflict. Last year  Ireland was proud to host the diplomatic conference that adopted the Convention on Cluster Munitions  a historic agreement aimed at banning the production and use of these most destructive of weapons. I warmly welcome the   5 09-52604  considerable progress that has been made this year towards the Convention’s entry into force. We now need fewer than 10 further ratifications to achieve this  and I urge all Governments that have not yet signed and ratified the Convention to do so at the earliest opportunity.  Ireland has always been strongly supportive of the leading role played by the United Nations in working to promote non-proliferation and remove the threat posed by nuclear weapons. Indeed  Ireland was the first country to sign and ratify the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Next year’s Review Conference will be of critical importance for efforts to help strengthen the international non-proliferation system  at a time when the threats it faces have perhaps never been greater. We encourage all Member States to work actively and constructively to achieve a successful outcome  and Ireland will engage fully in that effort itself. Ireland also applauds and welcomes the renewed focus on nuclear disarmament. We encourage the United States and Russia particularly as they work towards a legally binding follow-on arrangement to the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty  which expires at the end of this year.  Ireland would like to see the active engagement of the United Nations in monitoring human rights situations around the world maintained and strengthened. The Human Rights Council and other human rights mechanisms must be enabled to address the most difficult human rights situations in a timely and effective manner. Continued support will also be needed for the International Criminal Court and the international tribunals in their efforts to promote justice and combat impunity. Ireland urges the fullest cooperation by all Member States in this regard.  At the 2005 World Summit  the Assembly endorsed the important concept of the responsibility to protect. It is now imperative to take that work forward to put this concept into practical effect  based on the consensus resolution at the end of the sixty-third session (resolution 63/308).  Let me turn now for a moment to the situation in the Middle East. Ireland very much welcomes and supports the renewed international efforts made in recent months to reinvigorate the Middle East peace process with a view to bringing about a comprehensive and lasting peace settlement. Particular praise is due to the United States Administration and to the United States Middle East envoy  George Mitchell  for their intensive engagement aimed at achieving the resumption of peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority  as well as the promotion of peace between Israel and all of its neighbours. We are of course fortunate in Ireland to have had the benefit of first-hand experience of George Mitchell’s formidable skills  patience and tenacity as a peacemaker  and we hope he can bring these unique skills to this particular process.  With our European Union (EU) partners  we stand ready to work closely with our Israeli and Palestinian partners and to support the United States and the Quartet in their efforts. It is vitally important that all parties contribute to confidence-building by fully honouring their commitments and obligations under the Road Map. This must include real efforts to halt all settlement activities and improve the living conditions of civilians on the ground in the Palestinian territories. Ordinary people must see in their daily lives the benefits that will derive from peace and must be encouraged to take risks for peace.  Nowhere is this more urgent than in Gaza. We wish to see all border crossings fully and immediately opened to normal commercial and humanitarian traffic. We have all been shocked by the violence and widespread civilian casualties that took place during the conflict in Gaza at the start of this year. There must be some form of accountability for the most serious violations of international law that occurred at that time. The Human Rights Council is now addressing this issue in considering the comprehensive report prepared by Justice Goldstone and his team (A/HRC/12/48).  Like many others in the international community  Ireland has followed recent events in Iran with mounting concern. We urge Iran to comply fully with all of its obligations and commitments in terms of protecting the basic human rights of its own citizens. It is equally urgent that Iran respond to the demands of the international community to cease uranium enrichment and to answer satisfactorily all questions regarding its nuclear activities  particularly in the light of the latest revelations regarding the previously undisclosed nuclear site at Qom. The international community is ready to engage with Iran and has made generous offers to do so. It is for Iran now to decide whether it wishes to pursue the path of engagement or to opt for increasing isolation. We very much hope that    09-52604 6  the forthcoming discussions with Iran  to begin on 1 October  will mark the start of a constructive engagement on the major issues of international concern.  The continuing humanitarian tragedy of Darfur horrifies world opinion and simply cannot be ignored. I want to pay tribute to the United Nations and international humanitarian staff  who are working tirelessly and selflessly under the most difficult of circumstances. I think in particular of Sharon Commins and Hilda Kuwuki  two brave and dedicated aid workers with the Irish agency GOAL  who were kidnapped in Darfur on 3 July. The Irish Government is grateful for all the assistance we have received from the United Nations and others in our efforts to secure the release of these two women. We fervently hope that the day of their release from captivity is not far off. The people of Darfur and of all Sudan richly deserve peace. We must all collectively continue working to promote the United Nations-African Union mediation in Darfur  to support full implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement and to ensure that justice and the defence of human rights prevail throughout Sudan.  In Burma/Myanmar  Ireland condemns the recent conviction of Aung San Suu Kyi and again calls for her immediate release and that of all political prisoners and for the launching of a genuine  inclusive political dialogue. International pressure is needed on Burma’s leaders  notably from other countries in the region  to change course and move to democracy.  In Sri Lanka  there remains an urgent need to improve the humanitarian situation of those fleeing the recent violence in the Tamil areas. The Sri Lankan Government must cooperate fully with the United Nations to alleviate the plight of those affected. It must also work for a political settlement which meets the aspirations of all communities in Sri Lanka.  Let me say in conclusion that  as the international community faces a formidable array of challenges  there has never been a greater need for the United Nations itself. With each new challenge that appears  the value of common action to address it at a global level becomes ever more apparent. There is a much clearer appreciation of this Organization’s potential to deliver an effective response to these challenges. Let us seize the moment and work together to ensure that the opportunity we have at present is transformed into real achievement on the ground.  We can all be justly proud of the record of the United Nations over the past half century. The challenge for us  the Member States  is whether we can mobilize the political will needed in order to ensure that the United Nations can deliver even more in the future. Ireland  for its part  commits itself to doing everything in its power to realize the full potential of the United Nations  this unique voice of the international community  in the pursuit of a much better and a much safer world. "
"80",3311,"IRN",64,2009,"I thank Almighty God for granting me the opportunity once again to address this important international forum.  At the outset  I wish to begin by congratulating Mr. Ali Treki on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session  and to wish him every success. I would also like to extend my thanks to Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann  President of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session  for his excellent stewardship of the work of the Assembly during his term.  Over the past four years  I have spoken about the main challenges facing our world. I have talked about the underlying causes of those challenges and about the need for world Powers to review their outlook and work out new mechanisms to address the pressing international problems before us. I have also talked about the two conflicting outlooks that prevail in our world. One is based on the predominance of its materialistic interests through spreading inequality and oppression  poverty and deprivation  aggression  occupation and deception and looks to bring the entire world under its control and to impose its will on other nations. That outlook has produced nothing but frustration  disappointment and a dark future for humankind as a whole.  The other outlook is one that espouses a belief in the oneness of the Almighty God  follows the teachings of His messengers  respects human dignity and seeks to build a secure world for all members of the human community in which everybody can equally enjoy the blessings of sustainable peace and spirituality. This is an outlook that respects all human beings  nations and venerable cultures in defiance of all types of discrimination in the world. It is also one that commits itself to an ongoing fight to promote equality for all before the law on the basis of justice and fraternity while laying a solid foundation to guarantee equal access for all human beings in their quest to excel in knowledge and science.  Time and again  I have emphasized the need to make fundamental changes in the current outlook on the world and on humankind  so as to be able to create a brighter tomorrow.  Today  I wish to share with the Assembly a few points about the changes that should take place. First  the continuation of the current circumstances in the world is clearly impossible. The present inequitable and unfavourable conditions run counter to the very nature of humankind and move in a direction that contravenes the truth and the goal behind the creation of the world. It is no longer possible to inject trillions of dollars of unreal wealth into the world economy simply by printing worthless paper assets or by   33 09-52228  transferring inflation and social and economic problems to others by creating severe budget deficits.   The engine of unbridled capitalism  with its unfair system of thought  has reached the end of road and is unable to move. The era of capitalist thinking and the imposition of one’s thoughts on the international community  which is intended to dominate the world in the name of globalization  as well as the age of setting up empires  is over. It is no longer possible to humiliate nations or to impose double standard on the world community.  It is necessary to delegitimize and reject any approach that holds up the realization of the interests of certain Powers as the only measure of democracy or employs despicable forms of intimidation and deceit in the name of freedom and democratic practices. Approaches by which dictators are portrayed as democrats lack legitimacy and must be totally rejected. Time has come to an end for those who define democracy and freedom and set standards while they themselves are the first to violate those fundamental principles. They can in fact no longer be both judge and executioner or challenge real democratically established Governments.   I would like to say again that the time has passed for a group of people who believe that they alone can define concepts such as democracy and freedom and put forth the criteria for those definitions while simultaneously violating the very principles to which they claim to aspire. The continuation of Governments is based on the rule of the people. The development of nations and increasing freedom worldwide will no longer allow them to continue their hypocrisy and vicious attitudes. For those reasons  most nations  including the people of the United States  are waiting for real and profound change. They have welcomed and will continue to welcome change.  How can it be possible that inhuman policies in Palestine have driven the entire population of the country from their homeland for over 60 years by means of force and coercion  attacking them with all types of weapons  including banned weapons  and denying them their legitimate right of self-defence  and  to the astonishment of the international community  calling the occupiers peacemakers and portraying the victims as terrorists?  How can the crimes of the occupiers against defenceless women and children and the destruction of their homes  farms  hospitals and schools be supported unconditionally by certain Governments and  at the same time  oppressed men and women be subjected the harshest economic blockade  depriving them of resources to meet their basic needs  including food  water and medicine  and leading to genocide? They are not even allowed to rebuild their homes  destroyed during the 22-day barbaric attacks of the Zionist regime  with winter approaching  while the aggressors and their supporters deceitfully continue their rhetorical defence of human rights in order to put others under pressure.  It is unacceptable for a small minority to dominate the politics  economy and culture of large parts of the world through complex systems  establishing a de facto new form of slavery  and harming the reputation of other nations  even European nations and the United States  to achieve its racist goals.  It is unacceptable that nations several thousand miles from the Middle East send their troops to intervene militarily and to promote war  bloodshed  aggression  terror and fear in our region  the Middle East  while brushing aside the protests of nations in the region concerned about their future and their national security  thereby violating peace and interfering in the affairs of others.   Such standpoints are baffling. We only have to look at the situations in Iraq and Afghanistan. A country cannot remain under military occupation in the name of the fight against terrorism and drug trafficking  when the production of illicit drugs has grown  terrorism has increased and tightened its grip  thousands of innocent people have been killed  injured or displaced  infrastructure has been destroyed and regional security has been seriously jeopardized.   Yet those who have created the current disastrous situation continue to blame others. How can they talk about friendship and solidarity with other nations while they expand their military bases in various parts of the world  including Latin America. That situation cannot continue. It is increasingly impossible to promote expansionist and inhuman policies on the basis of militaristic logic. The logic of coercion and intimidation will have dire consequences and exacerbate current global problems.  It is not acceptable that the military budgets of some Governments far exceed the budgets of entire    09-52228 34  countries of the world. Some countries export billions of dollars of arms every year  stockpile chemical  biological and nuclear weapons  establish military bases or have a military presence in other countries while accusing others of militarism  and mobilize all their global resources to impede the scientific and technological progress of other nations under the pretext of countering arms proliferation.  It is not acceptable that the United Nations and the Security Council  whose decisions should represent all nations and Governments through the application of democratic and popular methods of decision-making  be dominated by a few Governments who seek to serve their own interests.   Above all  in a world where culture  ideas and public opinion should be the only determining factors  the present situation cannot continue and a fundamental change seems inevitable. We must strive to establish a new world system.  Secondly  any change must be deep-seated both in theory and in practice  encompassing all spheres of our life. Outdated methods of government that have caused the current problems in society cannot be used to bring about change and create a better world. Liberalism and capitalism  in particular the types that seek to dominate the world and to alienate people from spiritual and moral values  will never bring humankind happiness  since they are the principal source of all disasters  wars  poverty and deprivation. We have all seen how unfair economic structures controlled by certain political interests have been used to plunder the national wealth of countries for the benefit of a group of corrupt businesses. Existing structures are thus incapable of addressing the challenges that we face. The political and economic structures created after the Second World War that sought to dominate the world have failed  in short  to promote justice and lasting security.  Rulers whose hearts do not beat with love for humankind and who have abandoned ideas of justice can never provide humankind with the promise of peace and friendship. By the grace of God  Marxism is no more; it is history now. And the unhindered growth of capitalism will certainly meet the same fate because  based on the divine tradition of a principle in the Holy Koran  the deceitful one  like a bubble on the surface of water  will disappear. Only that which eternally serves the interests of human societies survives.  We must therefore all remain vigilant to prevent the pursuit of colonialism and discriminatory and inhuman goals disguised under slogans for change or in any new format. The world needs to undergo fundamental changes  and we must all engage collectively to bring them about in the right way. Through such efforts  no one and no Government would consider itself an exception to change or superior to others  or try to impose its will on others by proclaiming world leadership.  Thirdly  all of the problems that exist in our world today emanate from the fact that rulers have distanced themselves from human values  morality and the teachings of divine messengers. Regrettably  in the current state of international relations  selfishness and insatiable greed have taken the place of such humanitarian concepts as love  sacrifice  dignity and justice. Belief in the one God has been replaced with self-belief. Some have sought to take the place of God and insist on imposing their values and wishes on others. Lies have taken the place of honesty  hypocrisy has replaced integrity and selfishness has taken the place of sacrifice. Nowadays  deception in interactions is called foresight and statesmanship. Looting the wealth of other nations is called development efforts. Occupation is introduced as a gift in promotion of freedom and democracy. And defenceless nations are subjected to repression in the name of the defence of human rights.  Global problems will be resolved  justice administered and peace maintained only through the collective determination and cooperation of all nations and States. The era of a world polarized by the premises of hegemony or the domination by a few Governments is over. Today  we must rise together through collective commitment against the present challenges. We must take change seriously and work collectively to help others return to basic moral and human values.  Messengers were sent by God to show the light of truth to humankind. They came to make people aware of their individual and social obligations. Living in piety  having faith in Allah and judgment of human behaviour or conduct in the next world  believing in the primacy of justice in both lives  seeking happiness  well-being and security in the happiness  well-being and security of others  respecting humankind  making efforts to expand love and compassion against hostility — these were all paramount in the teachings   35 09-52228  offered by the divine messengers of God  from Adam to Noah  Noah to Abraham  Moses  Jesus Christ and the last Prophet  Muhammad  may peace be upon all of them. All of them came to eliminate war and ignorance  eradicate poverty and uproot discrimination in order to spread happiness to the entire world. They are the best gifts that almighty God has granted to human beings. If the belief in Entezar — that is  in patiently awaiting the return of justice to Earth — can become a common goal and we join hands to achieve prosperity for all  then there will be greater and more genuine hope for reform.   Fourthly  in my opinion  we have several important matters before us. The Secretary-General and the General Assembly can take the lead by undertaking the necessary measures to fulfil our shared goals on the basis of the following actions.  First  the United Nations should be restructured in order to transform this world body into an efficient and fully democratic organization  capable of playing an impartial  equitable and effective role in the international relations. The structure of the Security Council should be reformed  especially by abolishing the discriminatory privilege of the veto right. The inalienable rights of the Palestinian people should be restored by holding a referendum and free elections in Palestine to prepare an environment in which all Palestinian populations  including Muslims  Christians and Jews  can live together in peace and harmony. All types of interference in the affairs of Iraq  Afghanistan and the Middle East  as well as all countries of Africa  Latin America  Asia and Europe  must be ended.  As our great Prophet said  a Government may survive with blasphemy  but never with oppression. The Palestinians continue to suffer oppression and their rights continue to be violated. Yet another group of Palestinians who lived in al-Quds al-Sharif were forced out of their homes as the occupiers and usurpers continue to destroy their residential area. Bombings in Afghanistan and Pakistan have not yet stopped  the Guantanamo prison has not yet been shut down  and there are still secret prisons in Europe.  The continuation of the present situation adds to hostilities and violence. Oppression and military aggression must be stopped. Regrettably  official reports concerning the brutalities of the Zionist regime in Gaza have not all been published. The Secretary-General and the United Nations have crucial responsibilities in this respect  and the international community is impatiently waiting for the aggressors and the murderers of the defenceless people of Gaza to be punished.  Regarding the second action  current economic structures must be reformed and a new international economic order set up based on human and moral values and obligations. A new course is needed that would help promote justice and progress worldwide by allowing the potential and talents of all nations to flourish  thus bringing well-being to all and for future generations.  The third action is that international political relations must undergo reform on the basis of promotion of lasting peace and friendship  the eradication of arms races and the elimination of all nuclear  chemical and biological weapons to pave the way for all nations to have access to advanced and peaceful technologies for the advancement of the human race.  The fourth action is that we should reform cultural structures  promote respect for the diverse customs and traditions of all nations and foster moral values and spirituality aimed at strengthening the institution of the family  which is the backbone of all human societies.  For the fifth action  worldwide efforts must be made to protect the environment and fully observe the international agreements and arrangements to prevent the annihilation of nature’s non-renewable resources.  My fifth point is that our nation has successfully gone through a glorious and fully democratic election  opening a new chapter for our country in the march towards national progress and enhanced international interactions. Once again  a large majority has entrusted me with this heavy responsibility.   And now  I want to declare that our great nation  which has made significant contributions both to world civilization and to the Islamic Republic of Iran itself  and as one of the most democratic and progressive Governments in the world  is ready to mobilize all its cultural  political and economic capabilities to engage in a constructive process aimed at addressing the international concerns and confronting the challenges that face human society. Our country  the builder of cultures  has itself been a principal victim of blind    09-52228 36  terrorism and the target of all-out military aggression during the first decade of its revolution.  Throughout the past 30 years  we have been subject to the hostile attitudes of those who at one time supported  with all their might  Saddam’s military aggression and his use of chemical weapons against us  and who at another time decided to take military action in Iraq to get rid of the same man.  Today  our nation seeks to create a world in which justice and compassion will prevail. We announce our commitment to participating in the process of building lasting peace and security worldwide for all nations  based on justice  spirituality and human dignity  while being dedicated to strongly defending our legitimate and legal rights.  To achieve those goals  our nation is prepared to warmly shake all hands which are extended to us in good faith. No nation can claim to be free of the need to change and reform in this journey towards perfection. We welcome real and humane changes and stand ready to actively engage in fundamental global reforms.  Therefore  we emphasize that the only path to continued safety and security is to return to monotheism and justice. That is the greatest hope and opportunity of all ages and generations. Without belief in God and commitment to the cause of justice  along with the fight against injustice and discrimination  the world structure will not be corrected.  Man is at the centre of the universe. Man’s unique feature is his humanity  a humanity that seeks justice  piety  love  knowledge  awareness and all other higher values. These human values should be supported  and each and every fellow human being should be given the opportunity to develop them. Neglecting any of them is tantamount to the omission of an essential aspect of humanity. These are common elements which connect all human communities and which constitute the basis of peace  security and friendship.  Divine religions pay attention to all aspects of human life  including obedience to God  morality  justice  fighting oppression and endeavouring to establish just and good governance. The Prophet Abraham called for the oneness of God against Nimrod  as the Prophet Moses did the same against the Pharaohs. Jesus Christ and the Prophet Muhammad  may peace be upon them  did the same against the oppressors of their own time. All of these men were threatened with death and were forced out of their homelands. Without resistance and objection  the face of the Earth will not be rid of injustice.  I turn now to my final point. The world is in continuous change and evolution. Mankind’s promised destiny is the establishment of a pure humane life. This will come about when justice prevails around the globe and when every single human being enjoys respect and dignity. That will be the moment when mankind’s path to moral and spiritual perfection will be opened and his journey to God and the manifestation of God’s divine names will come to be. Mankind should strive to represent God’s knowledge and wisdom  his compassion and benevolence  his justice and fairness  his power and art  and his kindness and forgiveness.  These will all come true under the rule of the perfect Man  the last divine source on Earth  Hazrat Mahdi  peace be upon him. He will be an offspring of the Prophet of Islam  who will re-emerge  and Jesus Christ  peace be upon him. Other noble and pious men will accompany him in the accomplishment of this grand universal mission. This is the belief in entezar: waiting patiently for the Imam to return; waiting patiently for the rule of goodness and the governance of the best  which he promises. This is a universal human notion and a source of the hope of nations for the betterment of the world.  They will come  and with the help of righteous people and true believers will realize man’s long-standing desire for freedom  perfection  maturity  security  tranquillity  peace and beauty. They will come to put an end to war and aggression and to reveal all knowledge to the world  as well as spirituality and friendship. Yes indeed  mankind’s bright future will come.  In waiting for that brilliant time to come and in a collective commitment  let us each do our part to pave the way and prepare the conditions for building that bright future. Long live love and spirituality. Long live peace and security. Long live justice and freedom."
"81",3358,"IRQ",64,2009,"Permit me to congratulate our brother and friend Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. Let me assure him of our delegation’s assistance and support as he discharges his task. Given his wisdom and experience  we are certain that he will successfully fulfil the tasks assigned to him and further the objectives of the United Nations. I would like also to thank his predecessor  Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann  for his presidency of the General Assembly during the previous session.  The current political process in Iraq  ongoing since the collapse of the former regime in 2003  has produced radical political change  pushing towards building a unified  independent and democratic federal Iraq with respected constitutional institutions. Realizing these objectives has not been easy and has not been without challenges  chief among which were domestic and regional forces attempting to return Iraq to the period prior to the change. These forces have used various means to attain that goal  including committing the worst of crimes  allying themselves with organized crime and joining with networks of international terrorism to disrupt the security and stability of Iraq.  Significant developments have taken place in Iraq since I stood here last year. The most important of them were the signing of the agreement with the United States on the withdrawal of its troops  organization of the American forces’ temporary presence in Iraq and the signing of the Strategic Framework Agreement with the United States. Based on that agreement  United States troops withdrew from Iraqi cities at the end of last June  and Iraqi forces assumed responsibility for security throughout Iraq. The security situation has greatly improved under the Government of National Unity  thanks to its tireless endeavours towards national dialogue and national reconciliation projects. These efforts seek to include all political parties and social groups  within the political process and outside it  that believe in the peaceful transfer of power. The Iraqi Government is also continuing its policy of imposing law and order in confronting terrorist groups  armed militias and outlaws  including those working to sabotage the political process and undermine security and stability in Iraq and the region.  The year’s great successes for Iraq have brought progress in its external relations. This year witnessed high-level visits from Arab  regional and other international Powers  many of which reopened their embassies in Baghdad. This has taken place within the framework of the Iraqi Government’s efforts to restore its international standing. The Iraqi Government will continue to deepen its good-neighbour policy of friendship and cooperation in order to restore its role in the Arab  regional and international communities  and to promote security and stability in the region.  The economic situation also saw significant improvement through a number of economic and financial laws enacted by the Iraqi Government  which led to increased personal income  purchasing power and social welfare services for our citizens. The Iraqi Government prepared an ambitious budget for this year  aiming not only at reconstruction  but also at building a sound and healthy economy to promote progress and general prosperity. The Iraqi Government has reviewed this budget and its economic programmes in the light of the financial crisis facing the world.  Improvements in the economic sphere have encouraged a significant number of internally and externally displaced Iraqis to voluntarily return to the country. The Iraqi Government has taken a series of practical measures and decisions aimed at facilitating the voluntary return of displaced Iraqis because it believes that the best solution for them is to return to their homeland. We therefore call upon States hosting Iraqi refugees and on international and civil society organizations aiding refugees to help promote a culture of voluntary return  because Iraq needs the capacities of all Iraqis to help build the future of their country.   25 09-52425   The most important challenge we face in the near future is the round of legislative elections scheduled for January 2010  for which the political parties have already started preparations. Successful elections will solidify the current political regime’s basis in democracy  pluralism and the peaceful transfer of power. Successful elections will move the political process forward from this initial stage to one of permanence and stability and will promote stability and security in Iraq. They will also help us build national institutions strong enough to support a State that is based on law and order  that is at peace with its own people and its neighbours and that is a solid force for security and stability in the region. This in turn will improve Iraq’s Arab  regional and world relations and foster its active return to the international community.  The real danger currently facing Iraq is outside interference in its internal affairs. The forces of such interference have committed the worst crimes against innocent Iraqis from many segments of society — men  women  children and the elderly. In an attempt to derail the security and stability achieved in Iraq during 2008 and 2009  they have recently engaged in a series of criminal bombings and terrorist attacks  the most recent of which were the Bloody Wednesday explosions of 19 August 2009  which targeted the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Finance — sovereign institutions of the country. These attacks killed many innocent victims  including many Government employees  as well as foreign administrators and diplomats.   These criminal acts claiming such large numbers of victims have reached the level of genocide and crimes against humanity  which are subject to punishment under international law. We believe that acts at this level of organization  complexity and magnitude could not have been planned  funded and implemented without the support of external forces and parties. Indeed  preliminary investigations and evidence indicate the involvement of external parties in these attacks.  Therefore  the Government of the Republic of Iraq wishes to place this important matter before the Secretary-General. Because of the nature and scope of the crimes committed  which require an investigation beyond Iraq’s jurisdiction  we request the Security Council to form an international independent investigation commission to refer those responsible to a special international criminal court. The Iraqi Government found itself obliged to turn to the United Nations to protect its people and stop the haemorrhaging of innocent Iraqi lives. We seek the international community’s support and assistance in establishing an independent international commission to investigate the crimes of terrorism against the Iraqi people and to label those crimes as genocide.  We look forward to improved cooperation and coordination with neighbouring countries and other concerned States to protect Iraq’s borders  exchange information  coordinate efforts  and to thwart groups that support terrorism and work against Iraq under any cover.  We are currently working towards the settlement of issues regarding Iraq vis-à-vis the Security Council; these were inherited from the former regime and led to commitments which we are attempting to meet. Iraq will continue to work with relevant parties and stakeholders at the United Nations to reach a settlement satisfactory to all parties and without prejudice to our obligations under Security Council resolutions.  As a result of major positive developments that have taken place in Iraq since the fall of the former regime and the removal of the dictatorship  the current situation is fundamentally different from the situation that existed when the Security Council adopted resolution 661 (1990).  Along with the adoption of Security Council resolution 1859 (2008) and the report of the Secretary-General pursuant to paragraph 5 of that resolution (S/2009/385)  this shows that the time has come for the Security Council to act in response to the Secretary-General’s report pursuant to the aforementioned resolution  and on the basis of its responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. It should review resolutions relevant to Iraq adopted under Chapter VII  starting with resolution 661 (1990)  with a view to restoring Iraq’s international standing.  Here  I must point out that since the collapse of the former regime in 2003  Iraq has been eager to respect international legitimacy and to deal with Security Council resolutions relevant to Iraq and to the situation between Iraq and brotherly Kuwait with the highest degree of responsibility and respect.  The current Iraqi Government inherited political and financial burdens and difficult commitments from    09-52425 26  the former regime through dozens of resolutions issued against the former regime because of its domestic practices and foreign policies. The Iraqi people are still bearing the consequences. After more than six years of hard and continuous work with the United Nations and its agencies  and within the framework of international and bilateral cooperation  Iraq has proven its desire and determination to return to the international community with all its resources and capabilities.  Therefore  because the situation which necessitated the adoption of the aforementioned resolutions no longer exists  we request a clear resolution by the Security Council to terminate all resolutions issued under Chapter VII which affected the sovereignty of Iraq and gave rise to financial obligations that are still binding on Iraq.  We and the Iraqi people look forward to the day when Iraq is released from Chapter VII sanctions. In this regard  I must point to the positive role of the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI) in providing advice and assistance. The promotion of mutual endeavours and cooperation between Iraq and the United Nations  and improved results of that cooperation in many fields  pursuant to Security Council resolution 1770 (2007) and other resolutions  require that the United Nations agencies and institutions step up their presence in Iraq  undertake field activities and re-open their offices in Baghdad  as other diplomatic missions have done.  The Iraqi Constitution sets the basic principles of Iraq’s foreign policy  which focus on good-neighbourliness  non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries  the peaceful settlement of disputes and establishing international relations based on common interests and respect of Iraq’s international obligations. These are the established principles of Iraq’s foreign policy.  On this basis  we seek to establish the best possible relations with other Arab and Islamic countries and are committed to the decisions of the League of Arab States and the Organization of the Islamic Conference. Accordingly  we endorse and support the struggle of the Palestinian people to uphold their inalienable rights  including the right to establish the State of Palestine on the land of Palestine.  We are also working to implement the legitimate international resolutions concerning the return of occupied Arab land. We consider the Arab Peace Initiative to be a practical step in the right direction towards resolving the Arab-Israeli conflict in order to achieve security  peace and stability in the Middle East. We call for the Middle East to be made a zone free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction  so as to promote opportunities to achieve peace and security in the region.  In this context  we call upon all States that have not yet acceded to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty to do so and to be bound by its provisions. Following years of isolation during the previous regime  Iraq seeks to form a new integrated economic partnership with the international community through the International Compact with Iraq. The Iraqi Government  in cooperation with the United Nations  is working towards convening the second review conference  to be held in Baghdad next November. We will seek the greatest degree of international participation at the conference  following on from the success of the first review conference  held in Stockholm last year.  The current political process in Iraq is aimed at building a federal  democratic and unified Iraq where the Iraqi people work under constitutional institutions  the rule of law  protection of human rights and full respect for all segments of society. We attach key importance to our ability and potential  as a country rich in natural and human resources  to achieve these goals.  However  at this most critical stage  we need political and economic support and international cooperation to gain firm footing that will enable us to move towards a future where we will be able not only to develop our country and our people but also to cooperate with the international community in achieving peace  security and sustainable development for all peoples. "
"82",3405,"ISL",64,2009,"It is indeed an honour for me to address this Assembly for the first time. I would like to start by congratulating His Excellency Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session  and I pledge him the full support of the Icelandic delegation in the difficult and arduous work that lies ahead of all of us.  Only a year ago this weekend  my country  Iceland  found itself caught up in the beginning of the global financial storm. It swept almost the entire banking system in Iceland off the ground and left my country facing its most severe economic setback in living memory. Iceland was the first country to fall victim to the greed and excess of financiers who abused rules  followed dubious ethics  hid their money in tax havens and introduced an irresponsible system of stellar bonuses that incited reckless behaviour and risk-taking beyond anything that we had ever seen before.  In Iceland  those responsible left in their wake a scorched earth: bewildered citizens  full of sorrow and anger  scarred by the possibility of imminent bankruptcy and the loss of their houses and jobs. I can tell this Assembly  however  that Iceland is pulling through  not least because of the hard work of our citizens  but also because we had friends that we could lean on. Our Nordic family did not desert us. The Baltic countries gave us their full moral support. And I would especially like to mention Poland  which  out of the generosity of her heart  lent us a hand without ever being asked — which we shall never forget.  The International Monetary Fund offered us a stabilization programme that remains broadly on track  although I have to use this opportunity to voice   33 09-52592  Iceland’s grave dissatisfaction with the fact that unrelated bilateral disputes have prevented the programme from being fully implemented. I would also like to mention that our application to join the European Union has been very warmly received by our European neighbours  for which I am very thankful. I can therefore stand before this Assembly and say with confidence in my voice that despite the hardships that are behind us  the financial storms in Iceland are beginning to break. That is due to the resilience and hard work of the Icelandic people  but also because you  the international community  lent us some very important support in the hour of our greatest need.  The salient point is this. In a globalized world  we have to tackle problems together  globally. We need to fight together the corruption that contributed to the international recession; we must work together to ensure that the financial czars are not allowed to speculate again with people’s lives; we have to work together to obliterate the tax havens they used and we also need to lock arms to create a sound global regulatory framework. The world has to fight the recession together  in the spirit of the United Nations  but also within the framework that is created by the United Nations.  Earlier in the week I had the privilege and honour to take part in the high-level Summit on Climate Change. It touched my heart when I heard the President of Kiribati describe the plight of his country  which might literally be obliterated from the face of the earth without his nation being responsible for it in any way. This is due to the drastic climate change that the whole world is facing. The President of Kiribati asked for the only thing that every human and every nation on earth really deserves: he asked for justice.  I believe that the best way to give justice to the people of Kiribati  to the people of the nations in the South Pacific and elsewhere  and to the generations of the future  is that we together put all our effort into reaching a decision on a legally binding agreement in Copenhagen that will strike at the core of this problem. I also believe that the best way to convince the sceptics to take that step is to highlight the success stories that we have. We have to show the sceptics that our goals are realistic and that we can achieve them.  I remind the Assembly that at the beginning of the general debate we heard President Lula present the success story of Brazil in terms of the sustainable use of energy resources that they have achieved. Allow me to take this opportunity to tell the success story of Iceland in this regard. A generation ago  we were as dependent on imported fossil fuel as any other nation in the world. Today  a generation later  80 per cent of our energy needs are met by renewables. All our heating  all our electricity is 100 per cent renewable. What we did was to use the treasures that we had not realized were under our feet and before our eyes  in the form of rivers — we used hydro and geothermal power. And I maintain that what we did  others can also do.  I want especially to focus attention on the vastly underestimated possibilities of geothermal energy. Many of the countries of the African Rift Valley have similar potential to that of Iceland. In South-East Asia we have the greatest geothermal potential in the world  and in Latin America there is also valuable potential. Many of these countries could  with the geothermal expertise that countries such as Iceland have  achieve a real transformation to clean energy; some could even become self-sustaining in terms of energy. But  of course  as always  what we need is finance. What we really need is a global climatic fund to transfer renewable technologies to developing countries to enable them to continue growing on a sustainable  renewable basis. The expertise we have developed in Iceland is available  and I would like to add that  despite our present financial difficulties  we have ensured that the geothermal training programme of the United Nations University in Iceland remains open and fully funded  as it has been for the past 25 years.  Climate change is also producing drastic effects in the Arctic. Iceland  the only State that lies entirely within the Arctic region  has therefore designated the Arctic as one of the main areas of her foreign policy. Science tells us  and we can read about it in the news  that soon a great part of the Arctic Ocean might be ice-free at the end of summer. This is a development that we have not experienced in our lifetimes  and it bears both good and bad tidings. If it happens soon  it will open a pathway for transportation between the Pacific and the Atlantic via the Arctic Ocean  with great benefits to trade. For better or worse  it will also facilitate access to vitally important resources in the Arctic.  However  here we must tread very carefully. The Arctic also possesses the most fragile ecosystem of the world  and it will be a real challenge to strike the right balance between the fragile environment and the use of    09-52592 34  its resources. In Iceland  we believe that it is very important to address those challenges regionally through the Arctic Council and that any territorial claims — which we have already seen emerge in the news — should to be settled on the basis of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.  Climate changes are also likely to have considerably negative effects on the fishing stocks of the world. Representatives would know better than me that more than a billion people  95 per cent of whom live in developing countries  depend on fish as their main source of protein. As is known  Iceland’s track record in the sustainable management of fishing stocks is second to none. In that  as in the geothermal field  we also have technological expertise that we are willing and would like to share. In that respect  I am also happy to say that despite Iceland’s current financial woes  we have ensured that the UNU Fisheries Training Programme in Iceland is fully funded. It is available to Member States  and I would be very happy for them to take us up on that offer.  During the course of this week  I have heard many speakers criticize the United Nations  but I would like to use the occasion of my first speech to this Assembly to praise the work of the Organization. In many fields  it has done well in times when the odds have really been heavily stacked against it. I want especially to take two examples from a great many that I could relate.  Iceland and my Government have always strongly endorsed the rights of women. In particular  we have taken to heart Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) on the rights of women  of women in the world to take part and be active in the peace processes in war-torn regions. I wish to remind the Assembly that next year is the tenth anniversary of the adoption of resolution 1325 (2000) and to take this opportunity to urge the United Nations to actively use that anniversary to promote the role of women as peacemakers all over the world. I would add that in that context  the unanimous decision of the General Assembly to create a new United Nations composite gender entity  to be headed by a special Under-Secretary-General (resolution 63/311)  was also very helpful. We thank all representatives for those important steps  and I urge the Secretary-General to move forward on that matter as expeditiously as possible.  The other cause that I wish to mention as a reason for my gratitude is the unanimous decision of the Security Council earlier this week to call for global efforts to stop the spread of nuclear arms and to boost disarmament (Security Council resolution 1887 (2009)). I remember when I was a very young editor in Reykjavik in 1986  when President Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev descended on the capital of Iceland. That historic meeting really signalled the end of the cold war. I will never forget that at that time  for the first time in my life  a world free of the nuclear nightmare became a workable goal  and that goal must be vigorously pursued. Only 15 minutes ago  I heard the Foreign Minister of India state that one of the greatest goals of the Indian Government was to support that development. Even though Iceland is a little bit smaller than India  I would add its weight to that goal. We really must pursue it as strongly as we can  and I am grateful to the United Nations for providing the framework for that.  There have also been other happy events for me  as a newcomer to this Assembly  during my first days here. I found it invigorating to hear President Barack Obama boldly describe his vision of a peace agreement in the Middle East based on the two-State solution and the cessation of all settlements. I believe that his strong declaration has created a fresh political momentum that we who are assembled here and the Governments of this world must not allow to fade away.  To sum up  I have talked about my nation’s financial difficulties  but I have also said that we are pulling through  not least because we have been able to seek the advice and support of the international community. Of course  Iceland is a small nation  but I have also described how  even though we are a small nation  we have much to offer that could contribute to the solution of some of the problems that  together  the world is facing today. Our expertise in the geothermal field  for example  can be of vital importance in the face of the climate crisis  and our experience in sustainable fishing can be instrumental in staving off the depletion of fishing stocks. Our geopolitical position in the Arctic and our cohabitation with its dangers and beauty for more than a thousand years can be of great value in striking the right balance between a fragile ecosystem in the Arctic and the use of its resources.  It is true that the crisis destroyed financial assets  but Iceland’s real assets — natural resources  human   35 09-52592  capital and social welfare — remain intact. That is why I am so confident when I say that although Iceland was the first to fall victim to the global financial crisis  it is already on the road to recovery."
"83",3452,"ISR",64,2009,"Nearly 62 years ago  the United Nations recognized the right of the Jews  an ancient people 3 500 years old  to a State of their own in their ancestral homeland. I stand here today as the Prime Minister of Israel  the Jewish State  and I speak to the Assembly on behalf of my country and my people.  The United Nations was founded after the carnage of the Second World War and the horrors of the Holocaust. It was charged with preventing the reoccurrence of such horrendous events. Nothing has undermined that mission  nothing has impeded it more  than the systematic assault on the truth. Yesterday  the President of Iran stood at this very rostrum spewing his latest anti-Semitic rants. Just a few days earlier  he again claimed that the Holocaust was a lie.  Last month  I went to a villa in a suburb of Berlin called Wannsee. There  on 20 January 1942  after a hearty meal  senior Nazi officials met and decided to exterminate my people. They left detailed minutes of that meeting that have been preserved for posterity by successive German Governments. I have here a copy of the minutes of the meeting of senior Nazi officials instructing the Nazi Government exactly how to carry out the extermination of the Jewish people. Is that protocol a lie? Are the German Government and all German Governments lying?  The day before I was in Wannsee  in Berlin I was given the original construction plans for the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp. I now hold in my hand the Auschwitz-Birkenau plans. They contain the signature of Heinrich Himmler  Hitler’s deputy  himself. Are those plans for the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp  where 1 million Jews were murdered  a lie too? In June  President Obama visited another concentration camp  one of many — the   09-52320 36  Buchenwald concentration camp. Did President Obama pay tribute to a lie?  And what of the Auschwitz survivors  whose arms still bear the tattooed numbers branded on them by the Nazis? Are those tattoos a lie  too? One third of all Jews perished in the great conflagration of the Holocaust. Nearly every Jewish family  including my own  was affected. My wife’s grandparents  her father’s two sisters and three brothers  and all the aunts  uncles and cousins were murdered by the Nazis. Is that a lie?    Yesterday  the man who calls the Holocaust a lie spoke from this rostrum. I commend those who refused to come and those who left in protest. They stood up for moral clarity and brought honour to their countries. But to those who gave that denier of the Holocaust a hearing  I say on behalf of my people  the Jewish people  and of decent people everywhere: Have they no shame? Have they no decency? A mere six decades after the Holocaust  they give legitimacy to a man who denies the murder of 6 million Jews  while promising to wipe out the State of Israel  the State of the Jews.  That is a disgrace. It is a mockery of the Charter of the United Nations. Perhaps some representatives think that that man and his odious regime threaten only the Jews. If they believe that  they are wrong — dead wrong. History has shown us time and again that what starts with attacks on the Jews eventually ends up engulfing many  many others.   For this Iranian regime is fuelled by an extreme fundamentalism that burst onto the world scene three decades ago after lying dormant for centuries. In the past 30 years  that fanaticism has swept across the globe with a murderous violence that knows no bounds and with a cold-blooded impartiality in the choice of its victims. It has callously slaughtered Muslims  Christians  Jews  Hindus and many others. The adherents of that unforgiving creed  although it is comprised of different offshoots  seek to return humanity to medieval times. Wherever they can  they impose a backward  regimented society where women  minorities  gays or anyone else deemed not to be a true believer is brutally subjugated.   The struggle against that fanaticism does not pit faith against faith  or civilization against civilization. It pits civilization against barbarism  the twenty-first century against the ninth  and those who sanctify life against those who glorify death. The primitivism of the ninth century ought to be no match for the progress of the twenty-first. The allure of freedom  the power of technology and the reach of communications should surely win the day. Ultimately  the past cannot triumph over the future  and our future offers all nations magnificent bounties of hope because the pace of progress is growing  and growing exponentially.   It took us centuries to get from the printing press to the telephone  decades to get from the telephone to the personal computer  and only a few years to get from the personal computer to the Internet. What seemed impossible a few years ago is already outdated  and we can scarcely fathom the changes that are yet to come. We will crack the genetic code. We will cure the incurable. We will lengthen our lives. We will find a cheap alternative to fossil fuel  and we will clean up the planet.     I am proud that my country  Israel  is at the forefront of many of those advances in science and technology  medicine and biology  agriculture and water  and energy and the environment. Those innovations in my country and in many others offer humanity a sunlit future of unimagined promise.  However  if the most primitive fanaticism can acquire the most deadly weapons  the march of history could be reversed for a time and  like the belated victory over the Nazis  the forces of progress and freedom prevail only after a horrific toll of blood and fortune has been exacted from mankind. That is why the greatest threat facing the world today is the marriage between religious fundamentalism and the weapons of mass destruction.   The most urgent challenge facing this body today is to prevent the tyrants of Tehran from acquiring nuclear weapons. Are the Members of the United Nations up to that challenge? Will the international community confront a despotism that terrorizes its own people as they bravely stand up for freedom? Will it take action against the dictators who stole an election in broad daylight and then gunned down Iranian protesters  who died on the sidewalks and in the streets choking in their own blood? Will the international community thwart the world’s most pernicious sponsor and practitioner of terrorism? Above all  will the international community stop the terrorist regime of Iran from developing atomic weapons and thereby endangering the peace of the entire world?   37 09-52320   The people of Iran are courageously standing up to this regime. People of goodwill around the world stand with them  as do the thousands who have been protesting outside this Hall throughout the week. Will the United Nations stand with them?  The jury is still out on the United Nations. Recent signs are not encouraging. Rather than condemning the terrorists and their Iranian patrons  some here in the United Nations have condemned their victims. This is exactly what a recent United Nations report on Gaza did  falsely equating the terrorists with those they targeted.  For eight long years  Hamas fired rockets from Gaza on nearby Israeli cities and citizens — thousands of missiles and mortars hailing down from the sky on schools  homes  shopping centres and bus stops. Year after year  as these missiles were deliberately fired on our civilians  not one single United Nations resolution was passed condemning those criminal attacks. We heard nothing — absolutely nothing — from the Human Rights Council of the United Nations  a misnamed institution if ever there was one.  In 2005  hoping to advance peace  Israel unilaterally withdrew from every inch of Gaza. It was very painful. We dismantled 21 settlements  really bedroom communities and farms. We uprooted over 8 000 Israelis; we just yanked them out of their homes. We did this because many in Israel believed that it would win peace. Well  we did not get peace. Instead we got an Iranian-backed terror base 50 miles from Tel Aviv. But life in the Israeli towns and cities immediately adjacent to Gaza became nothing less than a nightmare. The Hamas rocket attacks not only continued after we left  they actually increased dramatically. They increased tenfold. And again  the United Nations was silent — absolutely silent.  Well  after eight years of this unremitting assault  Israel was finally forced to respond. But how should we have responded? There is only one example in history of thousands of rockets being fired on a country’s civilian population. This happened when the Nazis rocketed British cities during the Second World War. During that war  the Allies levelled German cities  causing hundreds of thousands of casualties. I am not passing judgement; I am stating a fact  a fact that is the product of the decisions of great and honourable men — the leaders of Britain and the United States — fighting an evil force in the Second World War.  It is also a fact that Israel chose to respond differently. Faced with an enemy committing a double war crime — firing on civilians while hiding behind civilians — Israel sought to conduct surgical strikes against the rocket-launchers themselves. That was no easy task because the terrorists were firing their missiles from homes and schools  using mosques as weapons depots and missile caches  and ferreting explosives in ambulances.  Israel  by contrast  tried to minimize casualties by urging Palestinian civilians to vacate the targeted areas. We dropped countless flyers over their homes. We sent thousands and thousands of text messages to the Palestinian residents. We made thousands and thousands of cellular phone calls urging them to vacate  to leave. Never has a country gone to such extraordinary lengths to remove the enemy’s civilian population from harm’s way.   Yet faced with an absolutely clear-cut case of aggressor and victim  who do you think the United Nations Human Rights Council decided to condemn? Israel. A democracy legitimately defending itself against terror is morally hanged  drawn and quartered  and given an unfair trial to boot. By these twisted standards  the Human Rights Council would have dragged Roosevelt and Churchill to the dock as war criminals. What a perversion of truth! What a perversion of justice!  The delegates to the United Nations and the Governments that they represent have a decision to make. Will they accept this farce? Because if they do  the United Nations would revert to its darkest days  when the worst violators of human rights sat in judgement against the law-abiding democracies  when Zionism was equated with racism and when an automatic majority could be mustered to declare that the Earth is flat. If you had to choose a date when the United Nations began its descent  almost a freefall  and lost the respect of many thoughtful people in the international community  it was the day in 1975 it decided to equate Zionism with racism.  Now this body has a choice to make. If it does not reject this biased report  it would vitiate itself  it would recommence the process of vitiating its own relevance and importance. But it would also do something else. It would send the message to terrorists everywhere that terrorism pays: all you have to do is   09-52320 38  launch your attacks from densely populated areas  and you will win immunity.  A third point: in condemning Israel  this body would also deal a mortal blow to peace. Let me explain why. When Israel left Gaza  many hoped that the missile attacks would stop. Others believed that  even if they did not stop  at the very least Israel  in having made this extraordinary gesture for peace  would have international legitimacy to exercise its right of self-defence if peace failed. What legitimacy? What self-defence?  The same United Nations that cheered Israel as it left Gaza and promised to back our right of self-defence now accuses us — my people  my country — of being war criminals? And for what? For acting responsibly in self-defence? For acting in a way that any country would act  with a restraint unmatched by many? What a travesty!  Israel justly defended itself against terror. This biased and unjust report provides a clear-cut test for all Governments. Will the Assembly stand with Israel or will it stand with the terrorists? We must know the answer to that question now. Now  not later. Because if Israel is again asked to take more risks for peace  we must know today that the Assembly will stand with us tomorrow. Only if we have the confidence that we can defend ourselves can we take further risks for peace.  Make no mistake: all of Israel wants peace. Any time an Arab leader genuinely wanted peace with us  we made peace. We made peace with Egypt led by Anwar Sadat. We made peace with Jordan led by King Hussein. And if the Palestinians truly want peace  my Government and I  and my people  will make peace. But we want a genuine peace  a defensible peace  a permanent peace.   In 1947  this body voted to establish two States for two peoples — a Jewish State and an Arab State. The Jews accepted that resolution. The Arabs rejected it and invaded the embryonic Jewish State with the hopes of annihilating it.  We ask the Palestinians to finally do what they have refused to do for 62 years: say yes to a Jewish State. It is as simple  as clear and as elementary as that. Just as we are asked to recognize a nation-State of the Palestinian people  the Palestinians must be asked to recognize the nation-State of the Jewish people. The Jewish people are not foreign conquerors in the Land of Israel. It is the land of our forefathers.  Inscribed on the walls outside this building is the great Biblical vision of peace: “Nation shall not lift up sword against nation. They shall learn war no more.” These words were spoken by the great Jewish prophet Isaiah 2 800 years ago as he walked in my country  in my city  in the hills of Judea and in the streets of Jerusalem.   We are not strangers to this land. This is our homeland. But as deeply connected as we are to our homeland  we also recognize that the Palestinians also live there and they want a home of their own. We want to live side by side with them — two free peoples living in peace  living in prosperity  living in dignity.   Peace  prosperity and dignity require one other element: we must have security. The Palestinians should have all the powers to govern themselves except a handful of powers that could endanger Israel. That is why the Palestinian State must be effectively demilitarized. I say “effectively” because we do not want another Gaza  another south Lebanon  another Iranian-backed terror base abutting Jerusalem and perched on the hills a few kilometres from Tel Aviv.  We want peace. I believe that with goodwill and with hard work such a peace can be achieved. But it requires that all of us roll back the forces of terror led by Iran that seek to destroy peace  that seek to eliminate Israel and to overthrow the world order.  The question facing the international community is whether it is prepared to confront those forces  or will it accommodate them.  Over 70 years ago  Winston Churchill lamented what he called the “confirmed unteachability of mankind”. By that he meant the unfortunate habit of civilized societies to sleep and to slumber until danger nearly overtakes them. Churchill bemoaned what he called the   “want of foresight  unwillingness to act when action would be simple and effective  lack of clear thinking  confusion of counsel until the emergency comes  until self-preservation strikes its jarring gong …”.  I speak here today in the hope that Churchill’s assessment of the “unteachability of mankind” is for once proven wrong. I speak here today in the hope that   39 09-52320  we can learn from history  that we can prevent danger in time.  In the spirit of the timeless words spoken to Joshua over 3 000 years ago  let us be strong and of good courage.  Let us confront this peril  secure our future and  God willing  forge an enduring peace for generations to come. (spoke in Hebrew)  May God bless his people with peace; may God  give strength to his people; may God bless his people with peace."
"84",3499,"ITA",64,2009,"This morning  like all other members of the Assembly  I listened with great interest to President Obama’s statement. The President spoke from the heart with great idealism and called upon all of us to shoulder our common responsibility to secure the future of the world by bringing about real change. He expressed feelings  hopes and goals that I share and that I also intended to express here. However  since he said those things so well  I shall forgo that part of my statement and confine myself to reporting on the outcomes of the L’Aquila summit of the Group of Eight (G-8)  over which I had the honour to preside.    The L’Aquila summit brought together in that grief-stricken city the representatives of 28 countries representing more than 80 per cent of the global economy. Our first order of business was to continue the work being done on banking and financial market regulations  which will again occupy us in two days’    09-52179 50  time at the Pittsburgh summit. We believed it crucial to ensure solid and lasting growth. Economic activity must once again be based on the principles of equity and transparency. The new development model should also be based on open markets and a rejection of protectionism so that the poorest countries can benefit fully from the growth opportunities provided by international trade.  After L’Aquila  we decided to revive the Doha negotiations with a view to concluding them by 2010. Our trade ministers have already met in India to provide practical follow-up to that decision. Pittsburgh will be an important opportunity to reaffirm the political commitments undertaken at L’Aquila.  Progress was also made in the area of climate change. The major economies reached an agreement to limit global warming to two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The common front to combat climate change was reaffirmed by the broad participation in the meeting held here yesterday at the initiative of the Secretary-General. I thank him for the leadership that he demonstrated on that occasion — a quality so essential to the success of the Copenhagen summit.   L’Aquila reaffirmed a clear and fundamental concept that I wish to reiterate today. Overcoming the challenge of climate change will require commitment on the part of all actors in the global economy  without exception.  In the area of food security  we decided to establish a $20-billion fund for agricultural development and the fight against world hunger. The effort to restore agriculture’s place at the heart of the international agenda is a common thread running through the G-8 summit  the Pittsburgh summit of the Group of 20 (G-20) and the food security summit that the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations will host in Rome in November.   Too often in the past  the financial assistance allocated to developing countries has failed to reach those for whom it was intended. That is why we have decided that such financing should be invested in the implementation of concrete projects primarily targeting agricultural infrastructure. The beneficiary countries must also do their part. If it is to be effective  assistance should be directed only to those countries that promote democracy  are committed to good governance  respect human rights and protect women and children.  Finally  we discussed the need to firmly counter stock-market speculation and the manipulation of the energy  commodities and food resource markets. This is of the utmost importance. Speculation in food products — wheat  rice and soy — has led to serious crises  in particular on the African continent  where the elderly and children have been dying of starvation. In turn  dramatic fluctuations in oil prices have contributed to financial and economic instability. Why? Because the price of crude oil has risen from $70 to $150 a barrel  only to drop to $32 dollars and then bounce back to $70  despite a nearly 2 per cent decrease in world consumption over the past year. We know only too well that such fluctuations are caused by speculation  whereby a barrel of oil is bought and sold four to six times before it reaches the end user. And it is precisely the interest of speculators that drives up the price of a barrel.   Thus  it is an absolute priority that the futures market be more strictly regulated. In our view  we should also consider a global system of strategic commodity reserves in order to nip in the bud any speculative tendencies. Impartial specialized agencies  such as those of the United Nations  should also be empowered. Finally  the fight against speculation must also ultimately include the abolition of tax havens. Much has been done to eliminate existing havens  but we must also strengthen the monitoring role of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in order to fight attempts to create new ones.  In a nutshell  those are the main outcomes of the L’Aquila summit. The crisis from which we are emerging makes it incumbent upon all of us to address the issue of effective governance. The G-8 still has a major role to play in geopolitical  non-proliferation and development issues  as confirmed at L’Aquila. Together with the G-20  which is now developing alongside it  we need to coordinate our actions to tackle global economic governance and open it up to all major countries wishing to contribute. In doing so  we must  of course  respect the central role of the United Nations  beginning with its most representative organ  the General Assembly.  As for the United Nations  we must also reform the Security Council to make it more effective and representative. Let me strike a note of caution  however. Adding new national permanent members would simply increase the sense of exclusion of all countries that contribute actively to international peace   51 09-52179  and security and of those that could assume growing responsibilities in the future.  Finally  during the past century  the international community faced even more tragic crises than it does today. History shows that no crisis is insurmountable  but we must be positive  resolute and  above all  united. As President Obama recalled this morning  we are all going to have to roll up our sleeves. That is the key message sent from L’Aquila. Only through common commitment will we be able to restore the consumer confidence that is so indispensable to a renewal of spending and investment. Only through common action will we be able to overcome a crisis whose roots lie also in the psychological soil of fear as the determining factor.  If we are willing and able to do this together  our efforts will be successful and we will manage to limit the depth and the duration of the crisis. I have no doubt that we will succeed. I am absolutely sure of that.  I thank representatives for their attention  and offer my best wishes for their work. "
"85",3545,"JAM",64,2009,"I join other speakers in congratulating Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki on assuming the presidency of the Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. We are confident that his extensive diplomatic experience will guide his leadership. He can be assured of the support and cooperation of Jamaica during his tenure.   I also extend Jamaica’s appreciation to Father Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann for his energetic and visible leadership during the sixty-third session of the Assembly  and our gratitude to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his expert leadership of the Organization.  We meet at a critical juncture  as the world confronts multiple crises: the global financial and economic crisis and the food  energy and climate crises  joined by the H1N1 pandemic. Both developed and developing countries are affected by these crises. It is the poorest and most vulnerable  however  that are disproportionately affected and are least capable of responding. Even as major economies are reporting their emergence from the global recession  the outlook for most developing countries remains bleak. For many developing countries  there are no early signs of so-called green shoots of economic recovery. For the majority  the impact of the recession will be deep; it will be prolonged; and it will be painful. The irony is that developing countries are hapless victims of a crisis for which they are inculpable.  The synchronized nature of the downturn in the world economy means that its repercussions are evident in virtually every sphere. Inflows of financing and investment have plunged precipitously; exports are weak  and commodity prices are low; official development assistance has diminished drastically.     09-52592 18   Those consequences are reflected in Jamaica and throughout the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) region. Countries like ours now face the daunting challenge of protecting the most vulnerable of their citizens in a responsible and sustainable manner in the context of declining export demand  contraction in services  including tourism  and lower remittances. As with most developing countries  the fiscal and financial stress has forced us to make significant adjustments to our expenditure programmes.  The distressing reality is that we in the developing world have limited scope and capacity to mitigate the impact of the crisis. We have neither the fiscal flexibility nor the policy space to afford ambitious stimulus packages to respond effectively to the upheavals in our country.   A major corollary of the economic downturn is the problem of debt servicing and debt sustainability. Many developing countries could be on the verge of a debt crisis  and require special support to help them attenuate the impact of the global crisis.   Jamaica has always supported efforts to assist the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries that have benefited from debt relief initiatives. But there is another group of developing countries that are equally burdened by high debt and deserving of special consideration. I speak of the heavily indebted lower-middle-income countries  which are overlooked on the presumption that  by virtue of their levels of gross domestic product (GDP) per capita  they do not require international assistance. That approach continues to mask the reality of our vulnerability to external shocks  persistently high levels of poverty and dependence on commodity exports.  Jamaica is particularly concerned about the situation of highly indebted middle-income countries  which cannot benefit from the kind of assistance available to the Least Developed Countries and Heavily Indebted Poor Countries  but which have been devastated by the impact of the global economic and financial crisis. Jamaica is currently saddled with a debt-to-GDP ratio of 125 per cent. Along with our CARICOM partners  we will continue to advocate for a very special category of small  vulnerable and highly indebted middle-income countries. A review of the criteria for determining middle-income status could help to address financial resource accessibility in the long term. We are lobbying for a review of those criteria.  The pervasiveness of the crisis makes coordinated international action imperative. Over the last two days in Pittsburgh  leaders of the Group of 20 (G-20) met for the third time in less than a year to review the progress on commitments made at their last summit and chart a course to counter the impact of the adverse economic environment. As much as we value the inclusion of advanced developing countries in the G-20 process  we believe that it is critical that space be made to accommodate the voices of a wider cross-section of developing countries  particularly the most vulnerable. Our interest is in ensuring that the particular needs of small  vulnerable economies and highly indebted middle-income developing countries of the CARICOM subregion are addressed through appropriate representation at the summits of the G-20. We must have an integrated approach in order to craft the type of common strategy that a crisis of this magnitude demands.  At the same time  the United Nations must play an essential role in helping to manage the various ramifications of the crisis. It can ensure dialogue and enable a coordinated response based on an inclusive decision-making process. The United Nations Conference on the World Financial and Economic Crisis and its Impact on Development  held in June  provided a useful platform. Developing countries that are not part of the G-20 group were able to bring their concerns to the international community and contribute to the search for solutions to the crisis.   We are encouraged by the candour of leaders from the major industrialized countries who expressed their commitment  with obvious sincerity  to effectively addressing the concerns of developing countries in order to help them cope with the crisis. We are seized with a spirit of collectivity  and hope that this renewed momentum will overcome all obstacles and translate into tangible  targeted outcomes.  The severity and complexity of the crisis is underpinned by the interlinked and interdependent nature of the global financial system. The experience of the current crisis supports the case for strengthening financial regulation and supervision to address systemic weaknesses in the global financial system.   Reform of the international financial architecture is long overdue. Urgent steps must be taken to reform   19 09-52592  the governance structure of the international financial institutions  including a review of the policy conditions attached to lending by the International Monetary Fund. We are disappointed that there is as yet no visible action on reform of the international monetary and financial systems.  Jamaica is a trade-dependent country. We therefore agree that there is an urgent need to conclude the Doha Round of negotiations in a bid to revive global trade and to aid in global economic recovery. Development must remain central to that agenda. Any outcome of our negotiations in the Doha Development Round must lead to clear benefits for our farmers  producers  exporters and consumers. We must redouble our efforts in this critical area and resolve to transform international trade into an engine of growth.  Progress has been made in the implementation of Aid for Trade for developing countries. We must build on that progress. There are outstanding commitments with respect to the provision of technical and financial support to help strengthen the trading and production capacities of developing countries. We look forward to further collaboration with our international partners and aid and development organizations in pushing the Aid for Trade initiative to build on the supply-side capacity and infrastructure of developing countries  so that they can take advantage of trade opportunities and connections with the global economy  particularly against the backdrop of this global recession.  The threat posed by climate change must not be underestimated. Urgent and effective global action on climate change mitigation and adaptation is required to avoid the catastrophic consequences of global warming.  The Alliance of Small Island States Climate Change Summit on 21 September  as well as the Summit on Climate Change held here a few days ago  reinforced this fact: the time for action is now. We were heartened by the broad agreement that a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions is necessary to reduce global warming. What is now required is the necessary political will to take concrete  decisive action so that we can address this clear and present danger head on.  As a Small Island Developing State that is vulnerable to the impact of climate change  Jamaica has a vested interest in a successful outcome of the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen in December — an outcome based on equity and differentiated burden-sharing. It is now clearly established that developed country emitters have a historical responsibility for global warming and that they should take the lead in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  Other major emitters also have a role to play in climate change mitigation while taking into account their own development needs. To this end  we favour the conclusion of a post-Kyoto framework wherein the commitments agreed to by all the parties hold to the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. A successful outcome must also include concrete commitments on adaptation  mitigation  capacity-building  technology transfers and the provision of financial resources to assist developing countries in addressing climate change.  We recognize that action at the international level must be complemented by urgent action at the national and regional levels. The necessary steps must be taken to integrate climate change into broader national sustainable development planning. Jamaica has embraced this approach.  The pursuit of complete disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation  with particular regard to weapons of mass destruction  must remain a shared goal. The 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty provides an opportunity for renewed commitment to strengthen the non-proliferation regime.  Restoring peace and promoting regional stability through peacekeeping operations is at the heart of the contribution of the United Nations to international peace and security. However  as we have seen  peacekeeping interventions cannot by themselves produce the desired outcome of sustainable peace. The Peacebuilding Commission  established in 2006  can assure such sustainability and make a difference in the lives of people in post-conflict countries. We are therefore pleased that new arrangements have been put in place to make the Peacebuilding Fund more flexible as we seek to support peace efforts in countries emerging from conflict.  In my own region  Jamaica remains committed to the long-term stability  socio-economic growth and development of our sister country  Haiti. We recognize the important role of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) in helping to foster the    09-52592 20  environment necessary to ensure a sustainable future for the Haitian people.  We must increase our efforts to counter transnational organized crime  narco-trafficking and the illicit trade in small arms and ammunition  which threaten the rule of law and democratic governance in many countries  and fuel the spread of international terrorism. At the regional level  through joint collaboration and approaches within CARICOM  we continue to tackle these security challenges  which threaten the social and economic fabric of our societies.  The challenges presented by the outbreak of infectious diseases and the potential pandemics  such as HIV/AIDS and the H1N1 flu  call for common global strategies to ensure that developed and developing countries alike can respond rapidly and effectively. As a result of the global economic crisis  accessibility and affordability of essential medicines are expected to deteriorate in developing countries. In this regard  however  it is anticipated that developing countries will have access to the forthcoming H1N1 vaccine at an affordable price.  We end this first decade of the twenty-first century confronted by myriad challenges. These challenges are not constrained by borders and cannot be confronted by States acting on their own. They can only be confronted through international cooperation and effective partnerships. But this can only be achieved through greater multilateralism  with equitable participation by all countries  both developed and developing.  Jamaica firmly believes that the United Nations is the only organization equipped to undertake this task of inclusive multilateralism. With all its imperfections  the United Nations still enjoys legitimacy in the eyes of most people in the world. But the United Nations cannot  in its current form and structure  successfully tackle this task. It must be reformed to make it more responsive to all its Members.   Multilateralism cannot work effectively if the General Assembly  the most representative global body  is unable to assert itself as the central decision-making body of the Organization. Nor can it work if the Security Council remains an exclusive club  unrepresentative of the wider membership of the United Nations. The goal of the intergovernmental negotiations which commenced earlier this year should be to come to a definitive conclusion on comprehensive reform of the Council.  The theme that the President has chosen for this session is both apt and timely. It evokes the purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter. It calls on us to reaffirm and renew our commitment to joint responsibility for development  the realization of peace and security and harmony among peoples. It is in this spirit that we look forward to the erection of the permanent memorial to honour the victims of the transatlantic slave trade  which will remain an enduring symbol of our collective resolve to eliminate discrimination  social inequity and prejudice.  The United Nations must assert its unique capability as the world’s premier multinational organization to address the challenges and meet the needs of the poor and most vulnerable. We need  therefore  to urgently correct and reverse the tendency towards inaction  inertia and indifference which has so far frustrated efforts to address the development agenda. This would be in keeping with the ideals of the Charter and our shared vision for the fulfilment of the hopes  aspirations and expectations of all our citizens across the globe. We dare not fail to live up to those expectations  as to do otherwise would seriously impair the very credibility and relevance of the United Nations  particularly during this time of crisis."
"86",3591,"JOR",64,2009,"First of all  I would like very warmly to congratulate you  Sir  on your election to preside over the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. I am certain that  thanks to your recognized experience and wisdom  you will be able to enrich our discussions and provide an appropriate framework for our deliberations. That will ensure that  through our joint efforts  this session is a productive and special one that strengthens the role and improves the work of the Organization as the principal international body for multilateral action and the fulcrum of our joint efforts. I should also like to commend your predecessor  Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann  for his efforts during the previous session  which we appreciate. I also thank and commend His Excellency Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.  We are pleased to see concrete trends towards enhancing multilateralism in the United Nations. We are convinced that such a course of action is the best and most effective way to reach agreement and take up the complex international challenges we face. These challenges cannot be confronted by one country on its own  because they are transnational and complex in nature and require concerted international action under the auspices of a single international organization in which all participate. Although some have doubted the effectiveness of the United Nations and its ability to address the challenges and problems of the twenty-first century  there is no doubt that  because of the universality of its membership  it remains the ideal forum to address the current challenges facing peoples and Governments  of which we are all aware. As we are all aware  the current tendency to marginalize multilateral efforts — particularly those of the United Nations — has negative effects that only make problems more complex  instead of helping to overcome or resolve them.  The United Nations and its subsidiary organs require reform  including financial and administrative reform  so that the Organization can be fully effective in addressing present and future international challenges. Such challenges have arisen as a result of structural and systemic changes since the establishment of the Organization  as well as technological advancements  such as the information and communications revolution  and the well-known effects of globalization. All of this has made the world a global village in which everybody feels the negative effects of problems and challenges such as desertification  climate change  terrorism  poverty  pandemics and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.   Among the major achievements of the United Nations is its pioneering role in seeking to eliminate colonization and occupation in order to ensure the right of all peoples to self-determination. Although the Organization has assumed ongoing responsibility for the question of Palestine  Israel has  unfortunately  been occupying Palestinian and Arab territories since 1967 to prevent the Palestinian people from exercising their right to self-determination by creating an independent State on their national soil in the West Bank and Gaza  with East Jerusalem as its capital  on the basis of the line of 4 June 1967. Israel continues also to occupy the Syrian Golan and some Lebanese territory. For their part  the Arabs adopted the Arab Peace Initiative at the 2002 Beirut Summit and have reaffirmed its principles at all subsequent Arab summits  including that held in Doha last spring.  Discussions continue on the two-State solution and on a comprehensive peace  which would permit the establishment of an independent Palestinian State and enable Syria and Lebanon to recover their occupied territories. That would provide a just and agreed solution to the question of Palestinian refugees in accordance with the provisions of resolution 194 (III)    45 09-52586  which would ensure peace and security  with recognition of Israel by all Arab States. Israel continues to reject the Arab and international option of a just and comprehensive peace and a two-State solution under the international terms of reference and the Arab Peace Initiative. Therefore  a good-faith response reflecting genuine and positive political will must be forthcoming.  There has been unprecedented support in the international community — including in the Arab world and among the Palestinians — for the considerable and sincere efforts being made by United States President Barack Obama and his Administration with a view to the holding of serious negotiations leading to the two-State solution and the establishment of a comprehensive peace in the Middle East  which would be in the interest of the United States  Palestine  the Arabs  the Israelis and the entire world. We in Jordan  under the auspices of His Majesty King Abdullah Bin Al Hussein  son of His late Majesty King Hussein  continue to strive tirelessly to attain that noble objective  which our people deserve.  The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan fully supports the statement made by United States President Barack Obama on 23 September (see ). It provided a clear vision of a definitive solution and of terms of reference that would end the 1967 Israeli occupation in order to permit the establishment of a viable  independent Palestinian State with contiguous territory  living side by side in peace and security with Israel  and achieve peace among Syria  Lebanon and Israel. With regard to the political terms of reference for negotiations between the Palestinians and the Israelis  President Obama stated that the final-status issues of security for Israelis and Palestinians  borders  refugees and Jerusalem were key to successful negotiations. We appreciate the importance of his comments regarding the illegality of the settlements.   Thus  President Obama has demonstrated his firm commitment to a two-State solution and a comprehensive peace in the Middle East. Since his first day in office  he has continued to seek to create a constructive atmosphere conducive to the swift resumption of serious negotiations  on all issues and on all tracks.  The international community as a whole must also shoulder its responsibility to ensure the swift resumption of negotiations and their success. In that connection  I wish to express our appreciation and full support to His Excellency President Mahmoud Abbas for his commitment to peace based on genuine partnership  fundamental Palestinian and Arab principles and the international framework  as well as his sincere engagement on behalf of the Palestinian Authority in all efforts to achieve a two-State solution  which was demonstrated once again at the tripartite meeting organized by President Obama in New York at the beginning of this week.  This constructive and appropriate atmosphere has been marred by the actions of Israel  which refuses to halt its settlement activities  including in occupied East Jerusalem  where it continues to take unilateral action. Its excavations continue under and around the Al-Aqsa mosque and other areas that are part of the Islamic and Christian cultural heritage. It continues to demolish the homes of Arabs and to expel them. Israel is doing this in order to alter the demographic character of East Jerusalem  which has an Arab religious and historical identity. It is at the heart of the occupied territories and is inextricable from them. The Security Council and the General Assembly have declared those Israeli actions null and void.   From this rostrum today  we ask Israel to return to the peace process that everyone supports and to put an end to its illegal measures  including its settlement activities  in order to create an atmosphere conducive to the resumption of serious and productive peace negotiations on all tracks  in particular on such issues as monitoring mechanisms that include clear timetables and benchmarks for assessing the status of mutual implementation once negotiations have ended.   There can be no doubt that the United Nations has a direct role and an obligation in this regard  given its permanent responsibility for the question of Palestine  alongside the role of the Quartet  which we fully support. The Organization could also play a bigger part in the negotiations and verification mechanisms  as well as on other crucial issues.   We reaffirm the importance of the role of the members of the Quartet — the European Union  the Russian Federation  the United States and the United Nations. The blockade on Gaza must be lifted. Every day  our people there are suffering tragically  and they lack basic commodities. It is unacceptable and unreasonable that the siege should continue and the    09-52586 46  situation persist. The inhumane blockade must be ended and Gaza must be rehabilitated.   We hope that Palestinian reconciliation efforts are successful  and we fully support Egypt’s efforts in that regard. We should pay particular attention to the report of the United Nations Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict (A/HRC/12/48)  and we hope that it will promote the necessary follow-up.   The United Nations has played a central role in establishing an international human rights protection system and international mechanisms for promoting human rights and fundamental freedoms. The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan is honoured to have been a member of the Human Rights Council twice since its establishment. We appreciate the international recognition of our policies on the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms  adopted by my country under King Abdullah II.   In addition  the United Nations provided the impetus for international efforts to establish the International Criminal Court as a permanent international judicial body to try cases of war crimes  crimes against humanity and flagrant violations of human rights. Jordan actively participated in the Rome Diplomatic Conference that brought about the adoption of the Court’s Statute. We had the privilege of chairing the first meeting of States members of the Court.   The United Nations has also played a significant role in codifying international humanitarian law: its Charter prohibits recourse to the use or the threat of use of force in international relations. The Organization subsequently supported the adoption of the major international conventions on that issue  in particular the four Geneva Conventions  of which we are marking the sixtieth anniversary  as well as the 1954 Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict.   The United Nations has made great progress on the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction  in particular nuclear weapons  through the unlimited extension in 1995 of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). Here  we call for compliance with the other decisions accompanying the decision to extend the NPT from 1995 and for recognition of the Middle East region as a zone free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction.  We affirm our country’s commitment to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  while also reaffirming our legitimate right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy and to strengthening control mechanisms that would prevent peaceful programmes from being used as a cover for military ones. We are resolved to make peaceful use of nuclear energy  and we have adopted all the agreements  documents and verification mechanisms of the International Atomic Energy Agency.  The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan supports all international efforts to bring into force the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. We encourage countries to adopt and ratify the Treaty so that it may enter into force as soon as possible  which would be a step forward towards nuclear disarmament. We call for adherence to Security Council resolution 1887 (2009)  adopted on 24 September.   My country has always been and will remain at the forefront in the fight against terrorism and extremism and in working to bring religions and civilizations closer together  as well as in transmitting the true and admirable essence of Islam and its noble human values. We have therefore adopted important initiatives  including the Amman Message issued by His Majesty the King  and its accompanying document  the Good Word.   Jordan supports comprehensive national reconciliation in Iraq among all segments of the population  with no exception. It supports efforts to consolidate peace and security in Iraq in all spheres so as to ensure civil peace  territorial integrity  political independence and sovereignty and to stop all external interference in its internal affairs so that that brother country can fully recover its place in the region and in the world at large.   Finally  Jordan is committed to international peace and security. We participate actively in peacekeeping operations. The number of personnel that we contribute to the various peacekeeping operations in which we are taking part is growing and becoming geographically broader. This demonstrates that we are truly playing an active role in the United Nations  because we are backing up our words with action. It also shows our clear political resolve to contribute to serious multilateral action within the United Nations system.   47 09-52586   I would like to reiterate that we will do what is necessary  and more  to strengthen multilateral international action for efforts to implement a two-State solution and to achieve comprehensive peace in the Middle East  and for anything that contributes to international cooperation and to bringing together diverse civilizations  which would enrich the lives of our societies in the world that we share."
"87",3638,"JPN",64,2009,"I should like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to His Excellency Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki on his assuming the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. I should also like to express my respect to His Excellency Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann for his excellent leadership at the previous session. I also highly commend the dedication and leadership of His Excellency Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in tackling the various challenging issues that the United Nations faces at the present time.  It was 120 years ago  in 1889  that an electoral system  while limited  was initiated in Japan. From that time forward  the change of governments through elections has been a matter of course in Japan. Japan also enjoyed a period in the early twentieth century known as the Taisho democracy.  Japan is thus a nation with a solid heritage of democracy and elections. Since the Second World War  however  Japan has not experienced changes of power through the ballot box. Tensions between politicians and bureaucrats disappeared. It cannot be denied that as a result  Japan’s foreign policy has been somewhat deprived of vitality.  However  on 30 August this year  the Japanese people finally chose  through a general election  to have a change of power. This is a triumph for democracy in Japan and a victory for the Japanese people.   Last week  on 16 September  I assumed the office of Prime Minister of Japan  and thus I stand before you today. My new Administration embodies the dynamism of democracy and will exert all efforts to address both domestic affairs and foreign policy challenges through our all-Japan agenda.  Japan’s membership in the United Nations was approved on 18 December 1956. The Prime Minister at the time was Ichiro Hatoyama  my grandfather. At the eleventh session of the General Assembly  where Japan made its maiden speech  then-Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu stated:   “The substance of Japan’s political  economic and cultural life is the product of the fusion within the last century of the civilizations of the Orient and the Occident. In a way  Japan may well be regarded as a bridge between the East and the West. It is fully conscious of the great responsibilities of such a position.” (A/PV.623  para. 80)  My grandfather Ichiro  Prime Minister at that time  was an advocate of the concept of “yu-ai”  or fraternity. This “yu-ai” is a way of thinking that respects one’s own freedom and individual dignity while also respecting the freedom and individual   29 09-52320  dignity of others. There is a remarkable resonance between the concept of the bridge in Mamoru Shigemitsu’s address and Ichiro’s concept of “yu-ai”  or fraternity.   Now  53 years later  here before the very same General Assembly  I declare with firm determination that Japan will again play the role of a bridge. Today  the world faces numerous arduous challenges. This is not an easy era by any means  but the new Japan will not turn its back on such challenges. Based upon the spirit of “yu-ai”  or fraternity  Japan will make utmost efforts to become a bridge for the world  between the Orient and the Occident  between developed and developing countries and between diverse civilizations.   Today  I should like to address the Assembly regarding five challenges that Japan intends to take on in serving as this bridge.  The first is seeking measures to respond to the global economic crisis. While the global economy appears to have emerged from the worst stage of the crisis  it is still difficult to predict its future prospects  including the issue of employment. What Japan must do in this area is  first of all  to revive its own economy. The new Japan has a plan for achieving this. Child allowances totalling 5.5 trillion yen per year will serve not only as an investment in education but also as a means of stimulating consumption and addressing the low birth rate in Japan.  The abolishment of provisional rates on auto-related taxes will provide tax relief amounting to 2.5 trillion yen per year and at the same time is expected to enhance the cost competitiveness of Japanese industries through the revitalization of the distribution infrastructure.  On a topic I will return to later  we are setting a very ambitious target to tackle climate change  which should result in the creation of new markets  including for electric vehicles  solar power generation and clean energy businesses. Furthermore  we will ensure stable potential for growth through the creation of new industries and new technologies in maritime  space  next-generation information technology and other fields.  By reviewing economic policies through this change of power  Japan is sending a clear signal of the forthcoming revival of its economy.   The new Japan will also need to respond appropriately to globalization. The deepening of worldwide interdependence described by the term “globalization” includes aspects of both light and shadow. Expanding the light while controlling the shadow has become a task on a global scale for today’s world. As we advance the liberalization of trade and investment  international coordination is necessary to forge systems to rein in the issues of poverty and economic disparity — which are difficult to coordinate by simply leaving them to market mechanisms — and excessive money-making games. Japan will play a role as a bridge in international forums  including the Group of 20  towards the formulation of common rules to that end.  The second challenge is to address the climate change issue. As is apparent from the increased incidence of extreme weather events  rising sea levels and other phenomena  climate change is a danger that is already confronting us. Furthermore  efforts by one country can produce only limited effects. However  due to differences in short-term interests between developed and developing countries  and among developed countries as well as among developing countries  the path towards creating a post-2012 framework will be anything but smooth. The new Japanese Government has set a very ambitious target for a greenhouse gas emissions reduction of 25 per cent by 2020  as compared to the 1990 level.  It has also made it clear that it is prepared to provide more financial and technical assistance to developing countries than in the past  in accordance with the progress of international negotiations. This international commitment is premised on the formulation of a fair and effective international framework by all major economies and agreement on their ambitious targets. Japan has announced this ambitious pledge because it wishes to serve as a bridge among countries with varied interests and to preserve the planet for future generations. I would like to appeal strongly to the representatives present today — let us work together to ensure the success of the upcoming Copenhagen meeting.  The third challenge is that of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. I welcome the progress being made in the negotiations on nuclear weapons reduction between the United States and the Russian Federation. I also commend the United Kingdom and France for their initiatives. It is urgent   09-52320 30  that all nuclear-weapon States take concrete measures on nuclear disarmament. There are States currently engaged in efforts to develop nuclear weapons. Furthermore  there is an increasingly greater risk that nuclear materials and nuclear technologies will be passed onto terrorists or even actually used.  In this area as well  Japan has the potential to become a promoter of nuclear disarmament and to serve as a bridge between States possessing nuclear weapons and those without them. Japan can speak with the greatest persuasiveness in urging nuclear-weapon States towards nuclear disarmament and non-nuclear-weapon States to avoid the temptation to acquire nuclear weapons. Japan can do so because it is the only country which has ever suffered the devastation of atomic bombs and  as such  has never ceased to appeal for no more Hiroshimas and no more Nagasakis. Japan has also continued to maintain its three non-nuclear principles  despite its potential capability to acquire nuclear weapons.  In April this year in Prague  President Barack Obama articulated a vision of a world without nuclear weapons  inspiring people throughout the globe. I am one of those people. In order to ensure the success of the Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  to be held next year in May  we must take action now towards the early entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and the early commencement of negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty.  Here  I must touch upon the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. Its nuclear tests and missile launches are a threat to the peace and stability not only of the region  but also of the international community as a whole  and cannot be condoned under any circumstances. It is imperative that the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea comply fully with the relevant Security Council resolutions and that the international community implement these resolutions.  Japan will continue its efforts to realize the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula through the Six-Party Talks. Japan seeks to normalize relations with the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea  in accordance with the Pyongyang Declaration issued by our two countries  through the comprehensive resolution of the outstanding issues of concern with the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea  including the abduction  nuclear and missile issues  as well as by sincerely moving beyond the unfortunate past.  In particular  regarding the abduction issue  constructive actions by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea  including swiftly commencing a full investigation as agreed last year  will be an avenue towards progress in relations between our two countries. If the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea takes such constructive and sincere actions  Japan is ready to respond positively.  The fourth challenge is posed by issues related to peacebuilding  development and poverty. Even in the twenty-first century  the world has not been liberated from the problems of poverty  infectious diseases  health  education  water and sanitation  food and illegal drugs. The situation is particularly serious in developing countries.  I am also compelled to point out the unfortunate reality that fragile or failed States can become breeding grounds for terrorism. The global economic crisis that began last year has exacerbated the situation. The new Japan should also become a bridge in this area. Japan will work in partnership with international and non-governmental organizations and strengthen its assistance to developing countries in terms of both quality and quantity.  Japan intends to continue and strengthen the Tokyo International Conference on African Development process  and redouble its efforts towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals and the promotion of human security.  For the stability and reconstruction of Afghanistan  Japan has provided assistance in a broad range of fields  such as strengthening the security sector  including through assistance for police  and developing social infrastructure. Japan has also extended agricultural assistance and capacity-building support  including vocational training  through the Japan International Cooperation Agency  its aid implementation agency.  Japan will proactively support Afghanistan’s own efforts to ensure its stability and reconstruction  in conjunction with the international community. It goes without saying that the primary actors in achieving peace in Afghanistan and in advancing national   31 09-52320  reconstruction are the people of Afghanistan themselves.  As progress is made  the reconciliation and reintegration of insurgents will become critical issues. Japan will make vital contributions in these areas  including possible reintegration assistance  such as vocational training aimed at providing a means of livelihood to people who have undergone reconciliation. The stability of the surrounding region is also important  and Japan is steadfastly providing support for Pakistan and other countries in the area.  In the world in which we now live  national security and human security are becoming increasingly intertwined. The path forward that will save humanity is one which can bring about shared security in which various nations  ethnicities  races and religions coexist while acknowledging the differences among them. In other words  it is to bring about shared security through the principles of yuai  or fraternity.   The fifth challenge is to build an East Asian community. Today  there is no way that Japan can develop without deeply involving itself in the Asia and Pacific regions. Reducing the region’s security risks and sharing in one another’s economic dynamism  based on the principle of open regionalism  will result in tremendous benefits not only for Japan but also for the region and the international community. Given the historical circumstances arising from its mistaken actions in the past  Japan has hesitated to play a proactive role in this region. It is my hope that the new Japan can overcome this history and become a bridge among the countries of Asia.  I look forward to an East Asian community taking shape as an extension of the accumulated cooperation built up step by step among partners who have the capacity to work together  starting with fields in which we can cooperate — free trade agreements  finance  currency  energy  the environment  disaster relief and more. Of course  Rome was not built in a day  so let us seek to move forward steadily on this  even if at a moderate pace.  In closing  I would like representatives to recall that the United Nations is the forum in which bridging diplomacy is made manifest. In resolving various issues of international peace and stability  development and the environment  among others  the United Nations has an immense role to play. I intend to make greater use of the Organization and to work to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the United Nations as a whole.  I firmly believe that Japan has the capacity to play an even greater role in the United Nations  and above all at the Security Council  as a bridge between various countries. Japan will continue to participate actively in the intergovernmental negotiations on Security Council reform  pursuing the expansion of both permanent and non-permanent membership and of Japan’s permanent membership in the Council. This concludes my message from the new Japan."
"88",3663,"KAZ",64,2009,"At the outset  I would like to congratulate Mr. Treki on his election to the high post of President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session and wish him every success as he presides over the session.   Eight years ago  on 11 September  Ms. Zhannetta Tsoy  a citizen of Kazakhstan  having kissed her daughter and husband  left for her first day at a new job in New York’s tallest building. Two hours later  she perished  along with 3 000 Americans and citizens of other 91 countries. She was buried under the debris of what had once been the World Trade Centre’s Twin Towers. On that day  as Kazakhstan’s ambassador in Washington D.C.  along with all Americans and others  I felt acutely how fragile  vulnerable and interdependent our world had become. This terrorist act and the world’s unity in its strict condemnation showed that only together can we make our present and our future safer and better. Indeed  the key to the successful resolution of today’s most acute problems lies precisely in the world’s unity and understanding.  President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan and our entire people have supported the global fight against terrorism from the start by assisting the efforts of the international coalition in Afghanistan. However  there has never been and there will never be a purely military solution to the Afghan problem. We note with satisfaction that coalition members have begun to pay more attention to non-military aspects of security.  To the best of its ability  Kazakhstan is also assisting the international efforts to rehabilitate Afghanistan. We provide considerable humanitarian aid to that country. Moreover  we are developing a long-term educational programme to train qualified Afghan   53 09-52470  specialists  and are also considering other forms of assistance to that country.  Long-term stability in Afghanistan is impossible without effective measures to tackle illicit drug trafficking. The Central Asia Regional Information and Coordination Centre has been established in Almaty  with the support of the United Nations  to fight illicit drug trafficking. As the Chairperson-in-Office of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in 2010  I intend to make the stabilization of the situation in Afghanistan — a regional neighbour of the OSCE — one of the organization’s greatest priorities.  The prospect of the proliferation of nuclear weapons  along with the risk of their acquisition and use by terrorist organizations  remains one of the most serious threats to mankind. As a country that has experienced the horrors of nuclear tests  shut down the world’s second-largest nuclear testing site  at Semipalatinsk  and voluntarily renounced the world’s fourth-largest nuclear and missile arsenal  Kazakhstan has an absolute moral right to call for more decisive action in the area of disarmament and for the radical strengthening of the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction regime. In particular  Kazakhstan deems it important to ensure the soonest possible entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. We welcome the efforts of United States President Barack Obama to give new impetus to the non-proliferation process and to eliminate the nuclear threat.  Kazakhstan is in favour of strengthening and ensuring the universality of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). We must recognize that the Treaty is asymmetric in that it provides for sanctions only against non-nuclear-weapon States  whereas the nuclear Powers themselves should set the example of reducing and renouncing their nuclear arsenals. In this regard  Kazakhstan welcomed the unanimous adoption yesterday of Security Council resolution 1887 (2009) and believes that this historic decision opens a new era in humankind’s efforts to create a world without nuclear weapons. It is gratifying that the measures being undertaken today by the international community reflects the principled position that President Nazarbayev has expressed more than once from this rostrum and in bilateral meetings with heads of nuclear-weapon States and of States with nuclear ambitions.  It is necessary now more than ever to take even more decisive actions. Our President has proposed the development of a new universal treaty on comprehensive horizontal and vertical nuclear non-proliferation. The configuration of the new treaty and its contents will largely depend on the proposals of all interested States. An effective measure to strengthen the non-proliferation regime could be the establishment of an international nuclear fuel bank under the auspices of the International Atomic Energy Commission. Kazakhstan is ready to consider the possibility of locating it on our territory.  One important contribution made by Kazakhstan and other States of Central Asia to the implementation of the NPT was the entry into force in March of the Treaty on a Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in Central Asia. The peculiarity of the Zone is that it is located between two of the world’s largest nuclear Powers. The Zone could play a large practical role in preventing the uncontrolled proliferation of nuclear materials and in countering nuclear terrorism. We count on support for the Central Asian Zone  above all from the nuclear Powers  including their possible extension of negative security guarantees. We support the United States of America’s initiative to convene a global nuclear security summit next year.  I wish to draw the attention of the General Assembly to a proposal of the President of Kazakhstan on declaring 29 August international day for a world free of nuclear weapons. That date has deep symbolical meaning. On that day in 1949  the Soviet Union conducted its first nuclear test at the Semipalatinsk test site in Kazakhstan  and on the same day in 1991 the test site was shut down forever by decree of our Government. We hope that the General Assembly will support this initiative.  Today  humankind is experiencing the most serious global financial and economic crisis in decades. According to the International Monetary Fund  approximately 50 States have edged to the brink of an economic catastrophe. At the same time  the present crisis was largely inevitable. Unfortunately  the world’s economic development and the great leap forward in technology over the past 60 years could not solve such eternal problems as poverty and hunger. The gap between the rich and the poor continues to grow. More    09-52470 54  than a billion people live on less than $1 a day. Despite our exceptional achievements in modern science and medicine  almost 10 million children under five die every year of curable diseases. More than 30 million people worldwide live with HIV  while only 3 million of those have access to antiretroviral therapy.  The economic crisis has forced us to rethink and revisit many conceptual approaches that earlier seemed etched in stone. It has demonstrated once again the urgency of unifying all States’ efforts in addressing modern challenges. The leader of our country was among the first to share his vision for the world’s post-crisis development. He proposed drafting an international law on a single world currency  and the eventual establishment of a world emissions centre  a world anti-monopoly currency committee and a world committee on market freedom. The United Nations with its structural bodies and specialized agencies is the only global organization capable of addressing such large-scale issues.  At a time of acute social and economic breakdowns  the danger of inter-ethnic and inter-religious conflicts increases considerably. Located at the confluence of Asia and Europe and having maintained peace and harmony in a multi-ethnic and multireligious country throughout its years of independence  Kazakhstan is ready to act as a bridge of mutual understanding and tolerance between the East and the West.  As Chair of the OSCE in 2010 and of the 2011 ministerial conference of the Organization of the Islamic Conference  Kazakhstan is eager fully to use this unique opportunity to strengthen constructive cooperation between diverse cultures and civilizations and to take concrete measures on this issue. Furthermore  since 2003 our country has hosted three Congresses of Leaders of World and Traditional Religions  supported by the United Nations.  At Kazakhstan’s initiative  the General Assembly adopted resolution 62/90 at its sixty-second session  declaring 2010 the International Year for the Rapprochement of Cultures. We call on United Nations Member States to participate actively in celebrating the Year. Kazakhstan fully supports the goals of the Alliance of Civilizations and calls on all Member States and agencies of the United Nations system to contribute to strengthening tolerance and mutual understanding in the world.  In the current circumstances  the regional aspect of solving global problems takes on added importance. Our country is firmly committed to the consistent strengthening of regional cooperation for security and development in Central Asia. A unique security architecture is being created in Eurasia  its most important elements being organizations such as the OSCE  the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-building Measures in Asia (CICA)  the Shanghai Cooperation Organization  the Collective Security Treaty Organization and NATO. In that regard  CICA  convened as a result of an initiative introduced by President Nazarbayev from this rostrum in 1992  has become an effective mechanism for strengthening regional security and cooperation. In 2010  as our country takes up the chairmanship of the OSCE  we intend to work for the good of all its member States to strengthen the organization’s effectiveness in addressing new challenges and threats  as well as to further strengthen confidence-building and security measures in the Euro-Atlantic community.  In today’s rapidly changing world  the adaptation of the United Nations to modern realities is an important task for all Member States. Kazakhstan supports the reform process for the United Nations and its main bodies based on the principled position of the need to increase the effectiveness  authority and relevance of our global Organization. We are convinced that there is no alternative to the United Nations in the modern world  and there never will be. We support reforms on three principal tracks: revitalization of the work of the General Assembly  reform of the Security Council and coherence of the United Nations system.  Fifty years ago  Martin Luther King Junior said:  “Men often hate each other because they fear each other; they fear each other because they do not know each other; they do not know each other because they cannot communicate; they cannot communicate because they are separated.” Regrettably  those words are often true today  but they should not be so tomorrow. In an age of globalization and unprecedented interdependence in the world  there should no longer be mistrust  fear and hatred  but the principles of trust  understanding and cooperation should triumph. Only together can we properly address the difficult challenges facing humankind today and make our world safer and better."
"89",3710,"KEN",64,2009,"I should like to congratulate the President on the singular honour of having been chosen for the presidency of the United Nations General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. I would like to assure him of my delegation’s fullest support as he undertakes his momentous responsibility to unite Member States in pursuing the common goal of a more humane  secure  united and prosperous world.  There was a time recently when that elusive goal finally appeared within reach  but multiple new challenges have coalesced to render the goal even more distant. It is therefore most encouraging that the world is turning to the United Nations to find a common  global path to resolving the most intractable difficulties facing humanity. There is a clear recognition emerging that together we can all rise  but that separately  we can only sink.  There was a time when the powerful disdained this institution’s ability to be a unifying player. That is now changing  and in this regard  I would like to commend the President of the United States  who holds    09-52470 28  a very special place in the hearts of Africans  Kenyans in particular  for having on Wednesday so eloquently indicated the centrality of the United Nations in charting common solutions.  In order to better equip the United Nations for meeting these challenges  we must continue to press for reform in the Organization. The Security Council  in particular  must be enlarged and made more democratic and representative of current day reality. Part of the enlargement must include permanent  veto-bearing seats for Africa.  The world can no longer continue to marginalize a continent that is home to nearly one billion people. That is wrong in principle  but even more  it is wrong in practice. We cannot find sustainable solutions to our challenges when such a large part of humanity is given so little voice and role in that quest for peace.  The world is now acutely aware that the quest for peace begins with ensuring the survival of the planet. I would  therefore  like to thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for having convened the high-level meeting on climate change  which has put that issue squarely onto the world’s centre stage. There is no issue that so clearly unites the population of the entire world as climate change does.  Regrettably  the far-sighted decision at the 2005 United Nations World Summit to explore the possibility of a more coherent institutional framework for international environmental governance has not borne any fruit. This is particularly unacceptable now when climate change is indeed the most pressing challenge of our times. We therefore call for the upgrading of the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) in Nairobi  so that it can become the central environmental institution handling the numerous conventions.  We have noted with regret the emergence of multiple centres dealing with environmental issues. That dissipates their impact and sometimes even leads to contradictory actions. The United Nations Office in Nairobi should now be elevated to the same level United Nations Offices in Geneva and Vienna to enable it to provide comprehensive support to all Member States and organizations struggling to adjust to a new paradigm of a sustainable and dynamic green economy.  Without that  the lives of billions will be imperilled. Already  as the Secretary-General pointed out on Wednesday  another 100 million people may fall below the poverty line this year owing to climate change setbacks. Markets may be bouncing back  but incomes and jobs are not. These developments do not augur well for the future.  I regret to say that my own country is emblematic of the woes unleashed by years of rampant excesses in the global and local mismanagement of our environment. The melting of the famed ice caps of Mt. Kenya and nearby Mt. Kilimanjaro  the destruction of vast swathes of our once beautiful forests  the drying of fast-flowing rivers  the intensifying cycles of drought and floods  the spread of malaria to highland regions as temperatures rise — these are all consequences of human action within and outside our borders. And so the solution also must also entail action on both fronts.  The greater challenge for us  I am afraid  is the external one. We  like the rest of Africa  produce only a tiny proportion of the emissions that are rapidly warming the planet and wreaking havoc with our capacity to produce adequate amounts of food and energy and husband sustainable water supplies. Our economies are in disarray. We are victims of the richer world’s acts and omissions  and therefore we need large amounts of funds in assistance and private-sector investment to reverse the course of events. The world community must agree on concrete actions in Copenhagen.  But we in Kenya are not interested in playing the blame game or waiting for international action to materialize. We have already begun to make very tough political decisions to reverse the ravages. Our immediate goal is to fully restore our largest water tower  the famed Mau Forest complex  as well as Kenya’s other four water towers  and are embarking on a huge reforestation drive to plant seven billion trees  which will restore the carbon-taming sinks that once made us self-sufficient in food and energy. We are also undertaking a crash programme designed to rapidly shift energy production to green technologies that use assets in which we are naturally rich — wind and sun  but most important of all  geothermal energy  which could more than double our current energy production within the next four years.  For all of these programmes  we are mobilizing local resources  but we will need significant assistance and investment to succeed in our goal of achieving   29 09-52470  self-sufficiency in a green way. The rich nations have recognized that their own self-interest is served in promoting such green commitments in developing countries  but the existing mechanisms through which they can support such programmes need to be refined and made more effective in quickly releasing resources.  We therefore support British Prime Minister Gordon Brown’s proposal for a $100 billion facility  and at the same time urge that the $20 billion pledged by the Group of Eight (G-8) for enhanced food production be speedily mobilized and disbursed. We need immediate assistance in feeding the 10 million Kenyans who are now living in hunger and will otherwise face starvation shortly. Just last week we declared this situation a national disaster requiring $500 million to rectify  of which $250 million will be mobilized from our own resources  while we urgently appeal to our development partners to furnish the other $250 million.  Tens of thousands of livestock animals have died. This devastation is the result primarily of climate change. We have had droughts before  but they now recur much more frequently and with greater severity. One drought year is difficult enough  but the rains have now failed us for the past four consecutive seasons. I appeal to our well-wishers  who are many  to assist us in this dire emergency. To mitigate the suffering  we have carried out a massive mobilization — including of the military — in providing relief and in drilling boreholes and transporting water to areas in acute need.  I am very proud to say that despite the terrible post-election violence and the subsequent multiple reverses that made reconciliation and reconstruction even more difficult  our people have shown an extraordinary maturity and resilience in rising to unprecedented challenges. We were able to overcome the bitterness over the election with an accord that we signed with the help of the African Union and the mediation of Kofi Annan  as well as with the support of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon  who personally visited Kenya at the height of the crisis — for which we are deeply grateful.  Let me now turn to an area where peace does not prevail and which is a source of immense concern to the entire international community — and that is Somalia. As its immediate neighbour and with a large population of Kenyan Somalis  we have done more than any other country to assist Somalia in overcoming its divisions and conflicts. No one is more eager than we are to help defeat the forces of extremism in Somalia  which have so much sway because of the help of external elements. The continuing inflow of refugees  small arms and light weapons from Somalia is the major source of insecurity in our country.  The latest setback resulting from that insecurity is disruption through piracy against international trade in one of the busiest sea routes in the world. Despite the risks incurred by doing so  Kenya has offered facilities for the detention and prosecution of suspected pirates  as part of our international obligation to promote peace. We have also offered to host a United Nations-organized conference in Kenya on how to coordinate and more effectively deal with the scourge of piracy. In return  we ask the international community to recognize our many sacrifices and assist us in dealing with our major refugee and security burdens.  The Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) and the African Union have recommended to the United Nations Security Council that it impose a no-fly zone and a blockade of airports and seaports held by insurgents so as to prevent the influx of arms. Kenya fully supports their position. It is now incumbent upon the United Nations Security Council to take decisive action to forestall further anarchy in Somalia.  To succeed in the quest for peace in Somalia  we must recognize that the present focus primarily on the use of force has not led to any curbing of extremism. Indeed  the security and humanitarian crises are worse than ever. We must therefore take a more comprehensive approach in tackling the extremists — an approach that includes encouraging the Transitional Federal Government to much more aggressively pursue its commitment to a more inclusive political process  by bringing into the Government all forces that eschew violence. Such outreach to all moderates can succeed only with much greater international support. It is regrettable that many pledges made at the Brussels donors conference have yet to be honoured. I call upon all those who have not honoured their pledges to do so immediately.  Turning back to the global economic crisis  it is now recognized that one of its principal causes is the weakness of the international financial system. We should strengthen and promote effective multilateralism with the United Nations at the centre. We need to reform    09-52470 30  the international financial governance institutions  so that they can prevent crises and develop more effective and equitable responses to them.  The ideals and principles of the United Nations are  today more than ever  the surest hope for a more prosperous and equitable world. Multilateralism in this globalized age is the only sure way to ensure that peace  development and unity prevail at a time when the world is riven with so many divisions. We need a genuine partnership among all nations and peoples  so that everyone feels that he or she is a critical stakeholder in national and international decision-making. Finally  within democratic nations  each person’s vote is equal to those of all others  regardless of their power or wealth. That is the principle that must finally be applied to the workings of the entire international system."
"90",3734,"KGZ",64,2009,"At the outset  I should like to express our congratulations to Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki on his election to preside over the General Assembly. We wish him the best for his work in leading the Assembly at its sixty-fourth session.  Given the sweeping changes occurring at all levels of global development  the role of the United Nations as a universal international forum is difficult to overstate. The contribution of all Member States to increasing the effectiveness of the United Nations can considerably contribute to strengthening international peace and security  development  human rights  environmental protection and sustainable development.  We believe continuing United Nations reform to establish an efficient mechanism to address contemporary challenges and threats is important for the further strengthening of the Organization’s capacities and credibility. We call for broader representation in the Security Council and for improvement in its working methods. We propose expanding the number of permanent members of the Council by giving seats to Asia  Africa  Latin America and the Caribbean.  I would like to confirm that my country  being cognizant of our full responsibilities  is for the first time nominating itself as a candidate to become one of the non-permanent members of the Security Council  for the period 2012 to 2013. The Kyrgyz Republic  located in the heart of Central Asia  is taking an active part in maintaining peace and security  economic cooperation and environmental stability at both the global and regional levels. We are prepared to contribute as much as we can to the work of that key body of the United Nations.  The election of the Kyrgyz Republic to the Human Rights Council in 2009 illustrated the international community’s recognition of our achievements in building a developed society. I should like to take this opportunity to thank Member States for their support of the candidacy of the Kyrgyz Republic. I assure them that Kyrgyzstan stands ready to make every effort to promote issues related to the protection of human rights and respect for the rule of law and   11 09-52586  international law  as well as other issues on the Council’s agenda.  The Kyrgyz Republic welcomes the decision of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to visit the Central Asian countries. We look forward to great results from that visit.  The overall situation in Central Asia remains complicated. In many respects  it depends on developments taking place in neighbouring Afghanistan. No one would today dispute the fact that there is a need to work out and apply fundamentally new comprehensive and viable approaches in the humanitarian  politico-anthropological and socio-economic sectors  which will ultimately contribute to the building of a strong and prosperous Afghan State. It does not appear to be possible to achieve a final and complete stabilization of Afghanistan by military means alone.  On 4 March 2009  President Kurmanbek Bakiev of the Kyrgyz Republic announced an initiative to establish at Bishkek  capital of the Kyrgyz Republic  a permanent forum and centre for hosting international conferences on security and stability in Afghanistan and Central Asia. This was called the “Bishkek initiative”. We are convinced that this “Bishkek initiative” will become a forum of practical cooperation in the area of security  with priority on the problems of jointly bringing about peace  security and stability in the region  combating terrorism  separatism and extremism and countering illegal drug trafficking and cross-border organized crime.  Along with global challenges  every country faces its own specific problems. Addressing them will ensure that we move steadily towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.  At the same time  in this era of globalization  existing problems have proven to be very closely interrelated. The Kyrgyz Republic  as a landlocked mountainous country and one of the world’s developing nations  believes that the world community  under the leadership of the United Nations  can and must more actively assist in using the foreign-debt-swap mechanism to achieve sustainable development.  With respect to Kyrgyzstan  given the global economic crisis  we propose considering several options  namely  a swap of the Republic’s debt for providing assistance to Afghanistan in pursuit of its socio-economic development  and a debt swap for the sustainable development of poor mountainous countries and the rehabilitation of uranium tailing ponds.  The Kyrgyz Republic calls for the active involvement in Afghanistan’s recovery of neighbouring States that possess relevant scientific  industrial and agricultural capacities. Kyrgyzstan stands ready to take part in the restoration of communications  construction and the training of medical  educational and agricultural specialists. We are pleased to inform the Assembly that our country and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) signed an agreement on the development of a customs centre in the city of Bishkek for training Afghan specialists.  The General Assembly has adopted a number of resolutions on mountainous countries that contain analyses of their socio-economic situations and recommendations to international financial institutions  relevant United Nations agencies and Governments on how to assist them in overcoming obstacles to their sustainable development. The delegation of the Kyrgyz Republic  one of the initiators of a draft resolution on sustainable mountain development  would be grateful for support for that draft at the sixty-fourth session of the General Assembly.  We discussed problems related to planetary climate change at the high-level Summit of the General Assembly. Kyrgyzstan shares the opinion that environmental and ecological security problems are posing new challenges and risks in the twenty-first century. Kyrgyzstan will give highest priority to active preventive measures in the sphere of environmental protection as a foundation of its sustainable development and to maintain the balance between human rights  society  nature and the preservation of unique natural sites for our descendants.  The numerous uranium tailing dumps containing large volumes of the toxic waste of uranium production and other harmful technological wastes are of great concern to our region. They pose a grave danger to the health of the people and to the cleanliness of transboundary river basins and arable lands.  Kyrgyzstan is working tirelessly with other countries of Central Asia to draft international legal documents on the prevention of radiation pollution in Central Asia. Two framework documents have been adopted within the framework of the Treaty on the    09-52586 12  Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons — one on the environmental danger of tailing dumps and the other on the creation of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Asia. I would like to inform the Assembly that the Treaty on a Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in Central Asia entered into force on 21 March 2009  and we appeal to nuclear Powers to support this Central Asian initiative and to sign the protocol on negative security assurances.  I am pleased to note that the High-Level International Forum held in Geneva on uranium tailings in Central Asia demonstrated a new model of effective regional cooperation aimed at practical resolution of this urgent issue. The great interest and concern expressed by all participants — including representatives of Central Asian and other States  international organizations and donors at the national  regional and international levels — give us cause for optimism. I take this opportunity once again to express my gratitude to all our partners at the Forum  the United Nations system  the United Nations Development Programme  the International Atomic Energy Agency  the European Commission  the Eurasian Economic Community  OSCE and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.  In furtherance of the Forum agreement  the countries of Central Asia shall submit a draft resolution for consideration by the General Assembly on the role of the international community in the prevention of the radiation threat in Central Asia. We hope for timely action on the part of our international partners  donors and international organizations to address the problem of uranium tailing dumps and to provide sufficient financial  technical and other assistance to the region.  The challenges facing the United Nations are complex and demand consolidated efforts from all States. The representatives of the United Nations provide broad assistance to countries on a wide variety of issues. We appreciate their constructive cooperation on and support for Members’ initiatives. The United Nations Regional Centre for Preventive Diplomacy for Central Asia  established in Ashgabat in December 2007  has already proven itself in a short period of time. The issues raised by the Centre are relevant and require prompt responses. We support the intention of the Centre to expand its representation in each country of Central Asia and request the appropriate committees take our views into consideration.  Central Asian countries pay considerable attention to water and energy problems. Despite the activities to increase the effectiveness of water and energy regulation in Central Asia  pursued within the framework of integration organizations and regional structures  rallying countries around this issue remains the most pressing problem in our region.   We believe that mutually beneficial cooperation is the basis for long-term intergovernmental cooperation in the water and energy spheres. It is essential to create conditions to improve incentives to store water in reservoirs during the winter and then to make it available for irrigating fields in the summer. If this proposal were pursued  the largest reservoir in Central Asia  on the Naryn and Syr Darya Rivers  the largest watershed of the region  would have the required stocks of water in times of drought and be able to provide water at least to maintain food and energy security for all the countries of Central Asia.  If decisions are taken only for short-term benefit  and water is depleted and regulating capacities are lost  that would inevitably have dangerous consequences for the entire region. These strategic issues can be solved only by merging the irrigation and energy schedules for supplying water and providing compensation fuel deliveries that should be the subject of intergovernmental cooperation among stakeholders. Water conservation technologies should also be exploited.   In conclusion  I would like to reaffirm the adherence of the Kyrgyz Republic to the goals and objectives of the United Nations aimed at ensuring peace and security and the welfare of all nations and peoples on the Earth."
"91",3777,"KHM",64,2009,"First  I echo previous speakers in warmly congratulating Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki  of the Socialist People’s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya  on his election to preside over the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. I am confident that under the able stewardship of Mr. Treki  a veteran of the United Nations  the Assembly will make significant progress on many critical issues of common concern.  Our tribute also goes to Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann  of Nicaragua  who successfully presided over the General Assembly at its sixty-third session.  Everyone is concerned today about the considerable challenges that our world confronts  challenges such as the current global economic and financial crisis  climate change  food and energy insecurity  and the threats of terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. I hope that in its deliberations the Assembly will come up with new ideas to cope with those global challenges.  There is no doubt that the present global economic and financial crisis will go down in history as a landmark case of world economic meltdown. This global crisis has clearly undermined the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). While the developed countries have more possibilities and resources to cope with the slowdown  the developing countries have suffered the most  with huge losses of national income  as their economic growth is expected to fall sharply due to a drastic reduction in exports  which they have largely depended on  falling investments  rising unemployment and so forth.  In order to help mitigate the impact of this economic and financial disaster on developing countries  we should do everything possible to get the Doha Round negotiations back on track for a successful conclusion in order to break down barriers to trade  improve market access  particularly in agricultural goods  and reduce agricultural subsidies.  In this regard  Cambodia greatly appreciates the commitment that the Group of 20 (G-20) made in Pittsburgh  just two days ago  to “bringing the Doha Round to a successful conclusion in 2010”. At the same time  the Monterrey Consensus should be invigorated in order to help developing countries to alleviate poverty and meet the MDGs.  Under these terrible circumstances  we warmly welcome the G-20’s commitment  made in London in April 2009  to address the impact of the global financial crisis with the injection of $50 billion to support social protection  boost trade and sustain development in low-income countries  and with an additional $6 billion concessional and flexible financing over the next two or three years for social protection  including through investing in long-term food security in the poorest countries.  Today  everyone in the world is increasingly concerned about climate change  which is another very serious threat to humanity. Global warming has triggered more and more frequent cyclones  typhoons  extreme floods and droughts. Our planet is now confronted  more than ever  with increasing natural disasters. The worsening impact of climate change has now reached an alarming level everywhere around the planet. The shrinking of the Arctic summer sea ice should be an alarm signal for everyone that global warming is inexorably advancing  and with perilous speed.  South-East Asia  according to the Asian Development Bank (ADB)  will be the most affected region. Its vulnerability to climate change is largely a result of its geography  with low-lying nations and long coastlines. The negative impact of climate change on farming in South-East Asia would seriously jeopardize the production of rice and other agricultural products  and consequently would have ripple effects on food security  as South-East Asia is one of the world’s most important rice crop regions.  Based on the estimate by the ADB  the total cost of loss in agricultural production and other negative aspects of climate change would be equivalent to as much as 6.7 per cent of the region’s gross domestic product compared with the 2.6 per cent loss estimated for the world as a whole.  Cambodia is essentially an agrarian country  with the livelihood of more than 80 per cent of its population depending on farming. Therefore  it is very    09-52592 16  vulnerable to weather-related disasters. Fully aware of that danger and the serious consequences of climate change and global warming for the well-being  livelihoods and development of peoples around the world  Cambodia has been assuming its share of responsibility in the matter of global warming since 2003.  We have made the utmost effort to implement the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol by promoting Clean Development Mechanism projects and implementing our National Adaptation Programme of Action on climate change.  We have also launched a major campaign of reforestation all over the country; more than 49 000 hectares of trees have been planted. We have also banned timber exports.   In this context  Cambodia warmly welcomes the recent United States initiative to engage with the lower Mekong basin countries by sharing with the Mekong countries its best practices and experience on climate change and flood and water resource management. At the same time  the Mekong countries and Japan are now looking into an approach for the future to achieve sustainable development of the Mekong basin potential  with better respect for the environment of the mighty Mekong River.  Furthermore  Cambodia commends the recent promise of the Group of Eight (G-8) at its summit in July to work towards an 80 per cent reduction in heat-trapping pollution by 2050. Nonetheless  since climate change is evolving steadily with time  we may question whether the pledged reduction can match the speed of global warming. I believe that the industrialized countries  which produce 80 per cent of the greenhouse gases  should share greater responsibility and take more drastic and urgent measures to reduce emissions of those deadly gases.  Governments around the world have just over three months to craft a new treaty to deal with global warming. It will be a historic treaty for generations to come. The United Nations Climate Change Conference to be held in Denmark in December could secure a milestone plan to really slow down climate change for the safety of all humankind. Therefore  Cambodia believes that all countries and all actors should join hands to reach an agreement in Copenhagen in December. The international community has an obligation to roll back global temperatures before it is too late. The future generations of our children and grandchildren are at stake.  I turn to the subject of food and energy security. The sharp increase in oil prices last year prompted a number of countries to turn to the production of bioenergy crops as an alternative source of energy  thus reducing the available cultivated land  while the world’s population continued to grow day by day  increasing demand for food. The combination of those realities underlines the importance of a comprehensive approach to tackle the planet’s food crisis.  The challenge we now confront is  on the one hand  how to produce enough food to feed the growing world population  and  on the other hand  how to respond to the increased need for clean energy to save the global environment and stop the advancing climate change. The solution to this twin problem is to find a balanced approach between food crop and bioenergy culture  and to develop alternative energy sources to meet the growing demand. We should avoid any short-term solution to the energy problem that would have harmful consequences for food security worldwide in the long term.  Finally  Cambodia welcomes the outcome of the G-8 meeting in L’Aquila  Italy  with the commitment to mobilize $20 billion over the next three years to support agricultural production in poor countries. We hope that the commitment will be translated into concrete and timely action.  In parallel to all the serious global challenges that I have mentioned  there remain political and security problems causing great concern. Terrorism is a threat everywhere and has caused the death of innocent people. To fight terrorism more effectively  we need stronger and closer cooperation between the many authorities concerned in order to face up to such criminal acts against humanity. Moreover  some countries with the capacity to produce nuclear weapons have not yet signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).   The dissemination of weapons of mass destruction constitutes another massive  deadly menace to humanity. In this context  Cambodia highly values the call by United States President Obama on 23 September to “stop the spread of nuclear weapons and seek the goal of a world without them” (). Cambodia also warmly welcomes the   17 09-52592  Security Council’s resolve  expressed at its summit (see S/PV.6191) on 24 September  “to seek a safer world for all” (Security Council resolution 1887 (2009)  first preambular paragraph).  Within the framework of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)  we have the Treaty on the Southeast Asia Nuclear Weapon Free Zone  which is an important instrument to keep South-East Asia free of nuclear weapons in order to ensure peace and security in that part of the world. It is also a good confidence-building mechanism  which needs to be adhered to by all  especially the nuclear-weapon States. In recent years ASEAN has actively encouraged the nuclear-weapon States to accede to the Treaty  but there has been no concrete result or effect yet. Here also we appeal to all nuclear-weapon States to engage more constructively with the Treaty.  I come now to the Korean Peninsula issue. We are all concerned about the rising tension in that part of the world  which can affect peace and security in the region. Cambodia urges all parties concerned to exercise the utmost restraint and re-engage in peaceful negotiations in the six-party talks aimed at the early denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. We should call upon the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to keep in mind that the six-party talks remain an appropriate forum to contribute to the settlement of the overall problem in the Korean Peninsula.  While talking about threats to international peace and security  we should also keep an eye on the Middle East situation. The never-ending cycle of violence of the Israel-Palestine conflict must be broken. One of the most pressing issues is to achieve a just  comprehensive and sustainable solution to the problem of Palestine in accordance with the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people and the relevant Security Council resolutions. Cambodia strongly urges all parties involved to cease using military force and violence  in order to foster a peaceful and lasting settlement through the establishment of a State of Palestine living side by side with the State of Israel in a spirit of peaceful coexistence and close cooperation between the two peoples.  Before concluding  I should like to say a few words about United Nations reform. For many years now  almost all delegations to the General Assembly have voiced their demand for reform of the United Nations. But when it was time to act a conflict of interest arose. In my view  the reform of the United Nations should be in the interest of peace  security and development for the whole international community  and not just the particular interests of a country. The reform should also go beyond the restructuring of the United Nations organs  in order to enable this world body to engage itself more actively in revitalizing the primary role of the United Nations in world affairs. "
"92",3791,"KIR",64,2009,"I am indeed honoured to address this body on behalf of the people of Kiribati  but let me start by congratulating Mr. Ali Treki on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at this session. The tasks ahead of him and indeed ahead of us all are challenging. I am confident  however  that with cooperative efforts and commitment from all of us and with the President’s able leadership of this session  we should be able to rise to the challenge before us. I also take the opportunity to thank the President’s predecessor  Mr. D’Escoto Brockmann  for his commendable leadership during the previous session.  Every year  we gather in this Hall to deliberate on the daunting challenges that continue to confront us as citizens of the international community. We gather as leaders to find solutions to these challenges that will ensure the survival of humanity not just today but tomorrow and beyond.  Climate change is indeed the greatest moral challenge to humanity in our time  and I fear that our children and grandchildren will look back and ask us the question: “How is it that they knew what they knew yet they did so little?” We simply cannot afford the consequences of inaction. The people of my country are already feeling the impacts of climate change  which will only worsen over time. We  together with those of other low-lying States  will become victims of climate change.  I have been advocating a combination of pragmatic adaptation strategies for my people. It is our overwhelming desire to maintain our homeland and our sovereignty. However  with the inevitable decline in the ability of our islands to support life — let alone increasing populations — due to rising sea levels  we must also provide opportunities for those of our people who wish to migrate to be able to do so on merit and with dignity. Our approaches will be time-relevant  responding to the different levels of threat and impacts of climate change on our islands and our people as time goes by.   We expect greenhouse gas emitters to take appropriate action to mitigate these negative effects. We ask for assistance with our adaptation efforts and we ask those who might need our labour to be able to open their doors. It is important to stress that these options are not mutually exclusive.  The President returned to the Chair.  Our relocation strategy requires the support of the international community. On previous occasions  I have referred to existing initiatives with our regional development partners  and I wish to say again that I am grateful to the Governments of New Zealand and Australia for their support through the Pacific Access Category scheme  the Kiribati Australia Nursing Initiative and the Australia-Pacific Technical College programme. These are models that we believe can be implemented more broadly as a win-win option for all concerned. Pacific leaders have agreed to work together to address climate change through the 2008 Niue Declaration on Climate Change.   Internationally  the declaration adopted by Alliance of Small Island States leaders a few days ago outlines the issues of importance to small island developing States and calls for action on climate change  particularly leading up to Copenhagen. Resolution 63/281 on climate change and its possible security implications is a landmark decision of the General Assembly that acknowledges the link between climate change and security. I commend our Pacific ambassadors in New York for initiating and driving that resolution  and I thank the sponsors for their support.  I appreciate that reaching consensus in Copenhagen will not be an easy task  but I do believe that it is possible and that it is imperative that we do so. If we can mobilize trillions of dollars to address the challenges of the global economic crisis  then we must be equally capable of taking the action necessary to   27 09-52463  deal with the challenges of the global environment. Over the past few days  I have been deeply heartened to see leaders’ strong commitment to tackling this common challenge together  to hear leaders resolve to look beyond national interests and focus on the global interest  and by their understanding of the predicament of those on the front line of climate change.   To be able to see leaders’ strong determination to seal the deal in Copenhagen — a deal that  among other things  will address the plight of the most vulnerable — has given me hope and restored my faith in humanity and in the relevance of our global community and our global leadership. I take this opportunity to strongly commend the Secretary-General for his initiative in organizing the high-level Summit on Climate Change. That Summit provided us with the opportunity as leaders to talk face to face and to agree on a way forward for the climate change negotiations. I also thank my fellow leaders for their understanding  compassion and political will collectively to address this crisis and its impacts.  It is now absolutely necessary that we capitalize on this collective political will. We must direct our negotiators to act accordingly to ensure that our common resolve as leaders is in fact given effect. I know that we will not be able to agree on all issues  but at the same time I am sure there are some fundamental issues that we cannot afford not to agree on. Let us not waste any more time on diplomatic talk  language  drafting of amendments  posturing and empty platitudes. We know what needs to be done. It has been called many things — a new world order  the grand bargain  a new green deal — but Copenhagen gives us the opportunity to enter into a global compact for action on climate change between developed and developing countries  North and South  East and West. This might be our last chance. If we do not act now  who the hell is going to do it?  We have declared the Phoenix Islands Protected Area (PIPA)  the largest marine protected area in the world  covering more than 400 000 square kilometres of ocean area. It constitutes something like 11 per cent of our exclusive economic zone. PIPA is a collective partnership between my Government  Conservation International and New England Aquarium. The preservation of the Phoenix Islands and the surrounding ocean is our gift  our statement to humanity  in the face of climate change. It is our contribution to international efforts to significantly reduce biodiversity loss by the year 2010. Even now as we confront the possibility that our islands will become uninhabitable within this century due to rising sea levels  we recognize the value of protecting something that we firmly believe to be the common heritage of all mankind.  We are indeed encouraged to see the emergence of ocean conservation and management initiatives in the Pacific. Such initiatives include the Micronesia Challenge  the Coral Triangle Initiative and the Nauru Agreement. Kiribati and the Pacific are committed to the sustainable conservation and management of its oceans. At the Pacific Islands Forum in Australia last month  the leaders of the Pacific adopted the Pacific Oceanscape initiative  aimed at promoting collaboration and exchanges between marine protected areas in the region and with other partners. We call for support for this initiative from the international community.  The impacts of the climate crisis  the international financial crisis and the food and energy crisis have ended our efforts to achieve sustainable development and our way forward towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals. The particular economic and environment vulnerability of Kiribati as a small island developing State should be taken into account when considering us for graduation from least developed country status. Assistance provided to the least developed countries helps us at this point in time in our efforts to address challenges we face as a nation. To lose that assistance would be detrimental to our efforts and to the livelihood of our people. We reiterate our call to the United Nations to reconsider the listing for the graduation of Kiribati and other countries in the Pacific.  On the issue of global governance  the United Nations is undergoing change to adapt to the realities of our time. It must maintain its relevance if it is to address the security challenges that the world continues to face. We believe that the United Nations should be an inclusive Organization  particularly for States such as Taiwan that make a contribution to world harmony and have demonstrated time and again their willingness and ability to contribute positively to international cooperative efforts. Taiwan has demonstrated its commitment to international peace and security through its contributions to national  regional and international development programmes. It is only fair and fitting  therefore  that Taiwan should be allowed to    09-52463 28  participate meaningfully in meetings and activities of the United Nations organs. Given the impact of climate change and the demands of aviation safety and security on its development and the well-being of its people  we now appeal for the meaningful participation of Taiwan in the work and activities of the International Civil Aviation Organization and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.  In concluding  in the face of the common challenges facing the global community  it is encouraging to hear leaders call for a new global order in which our interests as fellow citizens of the planet override our national interests  particularly where global human security and lives are under serious threat. This goal reaffirms the principle of collective responsibility for the common challenges that we face.   The United Nations will and must continue to play a significant role in the new world order  particularly in mobilizing the political will and the necessary action and resources required to implement it. Copenhagen will be the test of the political will and commitment that we have declared over the past few days as leaders. It will determine the fate of the most vulnerable and eventually the whole of humanity."
"93",3822,"KNA",64,2009,"It is indeed an honour to address the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. Today  we converge in this Hall to outline how  from the perspective of our respective nations  this esteemed body might uphold the rights of all mankind  secure world peace and indeed  ensure the very survival of planet Earth.  We converge here in order to arrive at some collective insight regarding the interests of the world’s various peoples as well as the interests of humankind itself. We have come here not only to be heard  but more importantly to listen and ultimately to commit ourselves  both as a body and as independent  sovereign States  to constructive  ameliorative action.  I congratulate the President on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session and assure him of my Government’s full support; and if I may  through him thank his predecessor  His Excellency Father Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann of Nicaragua for his leadership during his presidency of the sixty-third session.  Our world is defined by issues of politics  the environment  trade and finance at the global level. Last year’s financial crisis  which continues to reverberate throughout the world  stands as a sobering reminder of the interconnectedness of our economies and the knowledge that multilateralism is indispensable. Whether we are speaking about global trade  monetary and fiscal policies  human rights protection  health and public security or protecting the environment  these issues have become interlinked. And their complexity means that no country can act alone.  The circumstances that precipitated the virtual collapse of several financial institutions were not created by small States such as St. Kitts and Nevis. Yet  as in the case of climate change  their consequences have been forced upon us and we are left to fend for ourselves. But  if we are to learn anything from the crises we face today  it should be that collective action and partnership are necessary not only in the management of conflicts but also in building effective  comprehensive and sustainable infrastructure to protect our citizens’ future. The ever-changing global landscape will require that Governments and institutions work to establish common regimes and international regulatory frameworks for some time to come.  To that end  my Government will support an enhanced role for political forums such as the United Nations to strengthen multilateralism. We owe this much to the citizens around the world  who still look to the United Nations for hope — rooted in the belief that through our efforts their aspirations will be realized.   We live in complex times  and unexpected developments challenge our resolve daily. But we cannot and must not relent. We must double our efforts and use the convening power and political authority of this Organization and others like it to find common ground  even in the face of strident and sometimes divergent views. That is how we build that indispensable architecture so as to create a legacy worthy of future generations. And that is no small feat; it is  in fact  a monumental task. But the Government of St. Kitts and Nevis is confident that the President’s central role in the coming year will help us to craft a template for collective action.  I would like this General Assembly to be able to see the world from the perspective of a small middle-income heavily indebted country. The country that I    09-52586 26  have the honour of leading is a small one — the smallest nation in the Western hemisphere. Despite the recent downturn  small economies like ours continue to display resilience and to make the sacrifices necessary to sustain ourselves.   As far as our access to capital is concerned  our hard work and sound management have had unexpected  harsh and destabilizing implications  with unwelcome restrictions vis-à-vis debt relief and other key matters. The international economic crisis has made clear the urgent need for the restructuring and repair of the global economic system. As this moves forward  I urge that the very real vulnerabilities of small States that happen to have high per capita gross domestic product be more clearly considered and reflected in multilateral policies  deliberations and procedures.   We seek support for a new debt forgiveness initiative within the framework of the reform of the international financial institutions and through the materialization of a concept of middle-income highly indebted countries  in which peculiarities and vulnerabilities no longer trigger punitive actions such as premature graduation from concessionary financing.  In addition  the global economic crisis  which began far beyond our shores  has nonetheless made its way to us and made it necessary for my country to develop and introduce its own stimulus package  thus forcing us to sacrifice urgently needed tax revenues in the interest of protecting employment and to find the means to shore up and advance the viability of our own private sector.  Nevertheless  we are continuing to invest in our people through education and retraining programmes and by working to attract international investments in critical sectors to generate employment and other business opportunities. By doing this  we hope to prepare for the future  when the global economy eventually rebounds.  It is no secret that our efforts can sometimes amount to very little  because  through no fault of our own  it is a fact that when global crises occur  small vulnerable economies tend to pay a disproportionately high price. But under my leadership  Saint Kitts and Nevis will not play victim or assign blame. We prefer instead to work vigorously at the national level and to collaborate actively internationally so as to introduce measures and systems that transform our economy and improve the lives of our citizens.  Going forward  we want our voices and ideas to inform whatever new architecture is developed  so as to avoid the mistakes of the past. Therefore  we will support the measures established to follow up on issues pertaining to recovery from the global financial and economic crises. And we intend to participate enthusiastically in the process to ensure that the recovery is comprehensive.  We have common challenges and a shared responsibility to tackle them. We in the Caribbean have repeatedly called on the international community to recognize the special circumstances attending the realities of small island developing States  not as a favour to us  but as a practical way of addressing the multifaceted and complex issues that we face. For instance  on the issue of environmental protection  the Government of Saint Kitts and Nevis has always urged a multilateral approach.  The interconnectedness of our planet  then  is indeed real  and nowhere is it more so than on the issue of climate change. Whereas small countries such as Saint Kitts and Nevis have tiny carbon footprints with negative environmental impact  global warming and climate change  with their effects  do not discriminate. We can all agree that the incidence of catastrophic climatic events  such as hurricanes  floods and mudslides  continue to cause more destruction and claim more and more lives each year.  The geography of our small islands is changing. Sea levels are rising  and the marine life on which many of our citizens depend for their livelihoods is fast diminishing. Our coastlines are being affected. Our reefs are paying a high price. The long-term implications for food production are dire indeed. Again  though those changes began far beyond our shores  climate change has been inflicting a massive and disproportionate blow on nations such as mine  causing us now to urge  in the strongest possible terms  timely and effective action. Saint Kitts and Nevis is not interested in stale debates about blame; we are interested in action  and we want to play our own part.  In the interest of advancing global stability  therefore  we urge unrelenting commitment to emission targets by industrialized nations. We urge that the major global emitters take the lead in ensuring that the resources are in place so that small island developing   27 09-52586  States can meet our adaptation  mitigation  technology transfer and capacity-building goals. And we urge that the emitters embrace the measures needed to compensate for the risks and the losses resulting from climate change.  We continue to collaborate regionally and to work towards efforts in the areas of disaster preparedness  reduction and mitigation. We recognize that high dependence on fossil fuels is untenable. Therefore  with support from the Organization of American States and private enterprise  we are exploring renewable sources of energy  including geothermal energy  in the Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis.  As the expiration of the Kyoto Protocol approaches  my Government welcomes the recent commitments by some industrialized countries to do more to address harmful emissions. I hope that that will be translated into concrete results on the environment and climate change at the Copenhagen summit later this year.  I also wish to urge the United Nations to strengthen the Small Island Developing States Unit with additional resources to make it more effective in addressing the concerns of Member States. I look forward to the Unit’s assistance as we work towards the five-year review of the Mauritius Strategy for the Further Implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States at the current sixty-fourth session. I urge Member States to ensure that the agreed goals of the Mauritius Strategy and the commitments made are implemented and to support initiatives proposed during the review exercise.  In multilateralism  constructive partnership is an effective strategy. In such an approach  we are forced to appreciate the value of belonging: the need for all peoples of the world to be embraced within the fraternity of nations and to be allowed to contribute to the common good. The Republic of China on Taiwan  a constructive partner to a range of countries around the world for so long  has a great deal to contribute to specialized agencies and programmes of the United Nations  such as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the International Civil Aviation Organization  given that climate change and aviation safety affect its own development  as well as the well-being of all mankind.  The issue of security continues to be prominent on the international agenda  and the global anti-crime campaign intensifies  as concern heightens in the face of emerging threats to our citizens and to society. This development is the result of a new wave of crime and violence  especially among the youth population. In the hemisphere  there is increased focus on human security in relation to the transnational nature of the categories of crime — especially illicit trafficking in drugs and firearms — that are linked to anti-social behaviour  particularly among our youth.   An emerging trend in the global analysis of crime points to a new variable: young people as victims of crime. Studies show that  in increasing numbers  the victims and perpetrators of crime are young men. The reality of coexisting in a global village  the prevalence and sophistication of modern technology  the enhanced communication infrastructure and the free movement of capital and people have given rise to an unprecedented escalation in crime and violence.  Youth alienation  youth rage and youth brutality are troubling global phenomena in urgent need of global analysis and action. And so  this moment demands that this body  with its unique capacities and capabilities and as part of its quest for international societal stability  marshal all available resources to better identify the underlying causative factors and come to a clear agreement as to how  individually and collectively  we can halt and reverse this destabilizing trajectory.  Violence is a multisectoral public-policy challenge. It spans several areas  including public security  governance  development and public health. The human  social and financial costs of violence are unacceptably high. In addition to physical injury and death  violence has a serious and lifelong impact on mental and physical health  including non-communicable diseases and HIV/AIDS  and damages the social fabric  leading to unsafe communities. Ultimately  violence slows economic and social development in those countries that can least afford it. However  scientific evidence amassed in recent years clearly demonstrates that violence and its consequences can be successfully prevented. But  at present  an integrated approach to violence prevention is lacking.  An attempt to define a regional response to the problem was made at a recent two-day regional    09-52586 28  symposium  held on 22 and 23 June 2009 in Saint Kitts and Nevis  on the theme “Confronting the challenges of youth crime and violence: Defining a multisectoral response”. We would like to call upon Member States to join us today in submitting a draft resolution in support of an integrated approach and multisectoral response to violence prevention  which we would wish to place on the agenda of the sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly.  My Government strongly condemns all forms of violence  including transnational organized crime and terrorism. And while we commend the United Nations for its continued assistance to Member States in our crime-fighting efforts  we urge that it extend its support by reopening  in the spirit of developing an effective multilateral approach  the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime regional office in the Caribbean.  The challenges we must meet are vast. The non-proliferation of nuclear weapons today and a world free of nuclear weapons tomorrow should be the goals of us all.  Within the Pan-Caribbean Partnership  we continue to develop and expand regional responses to the HIV/AIDS epidemic. The problems posed by the HIV/AIDS pandemic are a real and growing threat  not only in terms of loss of life and livelihood  but also to the extent that the disease eliminates the most productive groups in our society and demands outlays of capital that would otherwise be allocated to economic and social development. The Caribbean Community  through the Pan-Caribbean Partnership  has made gains in tackling the medical aspects of the disease.  The President returned to the Chair.  But we need to do much more to fight stigma and discrimination and to increase access to inexpensive antiretroviral drugs and treatment for those infected with the disease. With the help of the international community  we can reconcile the objective need of pharmaceutical companies to receive proper compensation for their research  development and investment without prejudice to those who are in urgent need of care and without politicizing the issue.  We  too  are very concerned about the challenges that non-communicable chronic diseases pose to small countries like ours and to mankind in general. In this regard  we join with the Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago in calling on the United Nations to convene at the earliest opportunity a special summit on non-communicable chronic disease.  In conclusion  Mr. President  my Government applauds your initiative to pursue effective responses to global crises and strengthen multilateralism. For Saint Kitts and Nevis  multilateralism is a sine qua non and the only effective approach to lasting peace  effective security and sustainable development. We have seen the fallout from unilateral action. Many of us have paid the price for the decisions and actions made in isolation by a few.  I emphasize that it is the fundamental right of all humankind to choose its own destiny. At the same time  we have a collective duty to act responsibly and to work in the interest of the common good. That is the premise of multilateralism. That is the promise of my Government  and  Mr. President  my delegation stands prepared and willing to support you in this cause.  I recall that it was Hubert H. Humphrey  former Vice-President of the United States of America  who felt it necessary to emphasize to individuals  like those of us in this Hall today  our responsibility to ensure that the United Nations is a force for verifiable  constructive change in the world. In reminding us and those who will come after us of what is expected of us  he said:   “The heroes of the world community are not those who withdraw when difficulties ensue  not those who can envision neither the prospect of success nor the consequence of failure — but those who stand the heat of battle  the fight for world peace through the United Nations.”  This we must do today and forever. "
"94",3848,"KOR",64,2009,"First of all  let me extend my sincere congratulations to the President  Mr. Ali Treki  on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. I am confident that under his able leadership  meaningful progress will be made during this session. I also wish to express my appreciation and support to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his tireless efforts in reforming the United Nations.  I would first like to recall the special historic ties between the Republic of Korea and the United Nations. The contemporary history of the Republic of Korea began with the United Nations. Under the auspices of the United Nations  we held our first democratic elections in 1948  and with the approval of the United Nations we became the only legitimate Government on the Korean Peninsula.   Indeed  the Republic of Korea is a country that has been championed by the United Nations. Men from 16 United Nations Member States came to our support when the Korean War broke out in 1950  only two years after the founding of the Republic. Fallen heroes of the Korean War from 11 countries are buried in the only United Nations cemetery in the world  located in Busan  the second largest city in Korea. To this day  the cemetery serves as a place for the Korean people to commemorate their noble sacrifices.  At the time of the Korean War  Korea was among the least developed countries in the world  with a per capita income of less than $50. But to everyone’s surprise  Korea was able to achieve both industrialization and democratization in a single generation. Korea has transformed itself from an aid-recipient country to a donor country.  While this achievement is the fruit of the Korean people’s toils and tears  the invaluable support of the United Nations has been a great source of strength. For this reason  Korea observed United Nations Day even before becoming a Member State in 1991. Building on such achievements  Korea is now embarking on a path of actively contributing to the international community. That is the goal that a global Korea aims to achieve.  We wish to share our past development experiences in order to help developing countries lift themselves out of famine and poverty. While financial support to developing countries is important  it is even more important to find the right development model to fit each country.   Today  the unprecedented financial crisis is compounding the difficulties of developing countries. As a member of the G-20 Troika   Korea is making the utmost effort to strengthen the free trade system which powers global economic growth  while also ensuring that the voices of developing countries are heard.  The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) set forth by the United Nations must be realized. Development cooperation and humanitarian assistance need to increase  especially for the developing countries most severely affected by the economic crisis. Korea will fulfil its pledge to triple the volume of its 2008 official development assistance (ODA) by 2015. And in 2011  we will be hosting the Fourth High-level Forum on Aid Effectiveness in Seoul. By ensuring its success  we will enhance aid effectiveness for the achievement of the MDGs by 2015 and contribute to strengthening the global partnership for a more comprehensive and effective development cooperation.  Today  young Korean volunteers  under the name of World Friends Korea  are doing volunteer work throughout the world to put into practice the spirit of love and giving. Currently  more than 3 000 volunteers have been dispatched to some 40 countries  and we will continue to send more volunteers  focusing on sharing our areas of strength in information technology  medicine and agricultural technologies as well as our experience in governance development.  Among other efforts  Korea is also actively engaging in promoting international peace and security   43 09-52179  and preventing terrorism through its participation in peacekeeping operations. Currently  Koreans are serving in 13 missions around the world. Since last March  we have also been taking part in multinational efforts to protect commercial vessels of all flags from acts of piracy in the waters off the coast of Somalia.  Korea will faithfully fulfil its responsibilities as expected by the international community  including in the areas of preventing conflicts  countering terrorism and responding to natural disasters.  Responding to climate change has become an indispensable and urgent item on the agenda for all of humanity. Climate change poses a common challenge to all humankind and thus requires the concerted efforts of developed and developing countries as well as newly industrialized countries. For this reason  all countries need to take part and be prepared in addressing this challenge.  Korea greatly appreciates the role of the United Nations in placing climate change high on the agenda as an urgent priority and in galvanizing global efforts to address this critical issue. At the Copenhagen Conference  to be held in December 2009  the international community is expected to deliver a very important decision with great implications for the future. At this very place yesterday  we reaffirmed our commitment to making the Copenhagen Conference a success.  Korea  while not included in annex I of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)  plans to make a voluntary announcement before the end of this year stating its midterm emissions-reduction target for 2020. Korea has proposed the establishment of a registry of nationally appropriate mitigation actions at the secretariat of the UNFCCC  with a view to inviting developing countries to voluntarily participate in mitigation actions and to providing the international support that they need. We hope that our proposals and efforts will contribute positively to the attainment of successful outcomes at Copenhagen.  To respond proactively to climate change  Korea has adopted low carbon green growth as a guiding vision for our nation and a strategy for further development. We are currently working to enact a framework law on green growth and establish a five-year plan for green growth. Thereby  we will not only transform our economic and industrial structures  but also change our very lifestyles to become more future-oriented. Under this plan  Korea will invest about 2 per cent of its gross domestic product in the field of green growth every year over the next five years. This is twice the level recommended by the United Nations.  The underlying objective of the low carbon green growth strategy is to promote sustainable development by putting in place a positive cycle in which the environment revives the economy and the economy preserves the environment. This strategy is the most effective way to address global climate change and to overcome the economic crisis at the same time. By pursuing a green growth policy that makes assertive fiscal investments in areas of green growth  Korea is preparing for the future  while also responding to the immediate economic crisis.  The development of green technologies and international cooperation are key factors in ensuring success in responding to climate change. At the expanded Group of Eight Summit last August  Korea was designated as a leader in transformational technology  including the area of smart grid technology. Korea will strengthen global partnership for cooperation on green technology and share the ensuing benefits of this partnership with the rest of the world.  While fossil energy is replaceable  water is not. Water is the most important resource in our lives. Accordingly  I wish to urge the President of the General Assembly  world leaders and the Secretary-General to take a special interest in the issues concerning water  since it is also a crucial factor in achieving the MDGs.  Today  close to half of the world’s population face water-related problems  and most of the climate change-related natural disasters  including floods  drought and rising sea levels  are water-related disasters. In the course of launching the East Asia Climate Partnership  the Korean Government reviewed water-related issues in Asia. We have come to the conclusion that the provision of clean water and the development of policies and infrastructure for inundation and disaster prevention are the most pressing issues at hand.  Korea possesses cutting-edge desalination technology and has been improving its integrated water resource management system. The restoration of Cheong Gae Cheon in Seoul  which had been a    09-52179 44  concrete-covered dry stream for several decades  has provided more than 10 million residents with a pleasant recreation site and a clean stream. This was an environmentally friendly greening project that helped the city to overcome the heat island phenomenon  not to mention rendering it more attractive at the same time.  Such experiences and achievements have led us to launch a four major rivers restoration project  involving the four rivers that traverse our country from north to south and from east to west. This project not only provides a fundamental solution for securing water and controlling flooding  but also enables us to revive the ecosystem of these rivers.  The time has come for the international community to establish a system of governance that addresses water-related issues effectively. I am aware that some 20 United Nations agencies have been working in earnest on water issues. Issues concerning water are complex  as they have a bearing on a wide range of areas. To establish a more effective system of international cooperation on water  I would like to propose a specialized integrated water management cooperation initiative.  Global peace and security form the cornerstone for maintaining the stability and prosperity of all mankind. Today  global peace is threatened by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery. To respond to these challenges  strong determination and cooperation among all countries are essential in strengthening the international non-proliferation regime  including the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Last October  Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon put forward a five-point proposal for nuclear disarmament. And  in his speech in Prague in April  United States President Barack Obama set out his vision for a world free of nuclear weapons. Through sufficient discussions  we anticipate that these initiatives  which embody the hopes and desires of humanity  will enhance a common understanding on nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.  In particular  a nuclear weapons-free Korean Peninsula must be realized in order to attain peace in North-East Asia and beyond. Denuclearization is a prerequisite to laying a path towards genuine reconciliation and unification in the Korean peninsula  which is the only remaining divided region in the world.  The Republic of Korea will play an active part in the concerted international efforts to dismantle the nuclear programmes of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. We urge the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to join in these efforts and to return to the Six-Party Talks forthwith and without precondition.  The 1992 Joint Declaration on the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula  to which both Koreas committed themselves  must be observed. On that basis  the Republic of Korea will increase dialogue and exchanges with the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea  and strengthen cooperation with the international community towards that country’s development. I have proposed a grand bargain that would involve dismantling the core components of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s nuclear programme and the concomitant provision of security assurances and intensified economic support within the framework of the Six-Party Talks. We are currently engaged in consultations with the concerned parties. I want to make it clear that now is the time for the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to make the decision to achieve genuine peace on the Korean peninsula  and for its own sake as well.  We are confronted with diverse and complex challenges that can be met only through international cooperation. In meeting the expectations of the international community  we hope that a renewed and strengthened United Nations will assume a greater role. To that end  it is important now more than ever for the United Nations to demonstrate efficient and effective management. We hope that the United Nations reform initiatives in the various areas will yield concrete results.  As a responsible State Member of the United Nations  Korea will continue to render its close cooperation so that the Organization can play a lead role in bringing progress to all humankind and the international community at large. Korea seeks to be a friend to the world that is considerate of others and contributes to global society."
"95",3894,"KWT",64,2009,"It is my pleasure  Sir  to convey to you on behalf of the State of Kuwait and on my own account our most sincere congratulations on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. Undoubtedly  your long regional and international experience will be an important asset in achieving the success we desire in the work of this important session of the General Assembly. I also wish to pay tribute to the presidency of your predecessor  His Excellency Father Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann  former Minister for Foreign Affairs of Nicaragua  during the sixty-third session. I cannot fail to express also our appreciation for the efforts and good offices of His Excellency Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and of the entire Secretariat staff. We thank them for all their efforts in the service of peace and security and in improving the performance and the programmes of United Nations bodies with a view to enhancing and developing their capacities to keep pace with new developments on the international scene and to respond effectively to the challenges and dangers of today’s world.  Never before has the world been in such need of a strong  effective global organization. The diversity and complexity of the challenges  crises and new developments which confront our world today  in addition to regional and international questions that have remained unresolved for a long time  require Member States to shoulder their responsibilities in supporting this Organization  providing it with the financial resources it needs to perform its duties and discharge its responsibilities effectively and with innovative methodology. Also  the United Nations itself has a responsibility to improve its own administrative structure and its performance in the field  and to enhance its capacity to detect and monitor developing challenges. This must be commensurate with the current dangers  which require bold initiatives  quick action and effective treatment.   Combating terrorism; eradicating poverty and hunger; combating dangerous diseases such as HIV/AIDS  malaria and the A (H1N1) influenza virus  which of late has spread in a frightful manner all over the world; and dealing with the spread of the scourge of illegal drugs: these are all challenges that require from our Organization innovative joint action that recognizes the dangers  diagnoses the crises  prepares the resources and intervenes effectively in a radical and collective fashion. Also  mobilizing specialized regional organizations to act in a concerted and organized effort is an important element in addressing these challenges.  Moreover  there are other challenges and threats from which the international community still suffers  the most prominent being the financial and economic crisis and the phenomenon of climate change. The financial crisis has had a negative impact on the economies of the developing countries and has impeded their efforts to attain the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). This has resulted in the emergence of economic and social problems such as a high rate of unemployment  deceleration in the rate of economic growth  the collapse of financial markets and an obvious contraction in regional and world trade.  In this regard  we welcome the Outcome Document adopted by the high-level meeting convened by the President of the General Assembly last June (see resolution 63/303)  where commitments were made to help developing countries overcome the effects of the financial crisis  through an increase in official development assistance  and to improve the international trade system. It also emphasized the need to continue the reform of the international financial institutions to ensure equitable representation on their executive boards and to enhance their oversight role  as well as to improve the conditions for providing financial and technical assistance for the developing and least developed countries.   37 09-52463   That effort  along with joint arrangements  led to the emergence of signs of global economic recovery during the last few weeks. It is our hope that such action will continue in order to address a no less dangerous crisis  that of climate change and the degradation of the environment. This problem requires an urgent global response. In this regard  we look forward to the success of the important Climate Change Conference  to be held in December in Copenhagen  Denmark.   Kuwait will be honoured to host in mid-December their Majesties and Highnesses  the leaders of the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf  at their thirtieth Summit Conference  where they will have a full agenda. Foremost of the many issues before them will be a project of vital importance: the electric grid linking their States. We hope that this strategic step will be the first of many  including the monetary unification project and the issuance of a unified Gulf currency.  The State of Kuwait is proud to top the list of Arab States  and to hold thirty-third position overall  in human development. As indicated in the Arab Human Development Report 2009  “Challenges to Human Security in the Arab Countries”  issued by the United Nations Development Programme  Kuwait scored the highest marks among the Arab States in the fields of education  health and general freedoms. Let there be no doubt that the Government of Kuwait will continue its efforts to improve economic and social conditions  and to achieve all the Millennium Development Goals even before the target date  which will provide a better life for its citizens and residents.  Kuwait is proud  too  that the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime  located in Vienna  has listed Kuwait as first among Arab States  and third globally  in combating illegal drugs and drug trafficking. That was possible only through a focused national effort and broad regional cooperation  which achieved outstanding results.  The State of Kuwait will continue steadily to meet all its financial commitments to international and regional institutes  funds and programmes in the field of development assistance as well as to support infrastructure projects in the developing and least developed countries. Kuwait will also continue to contribute to development projects through the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development  which since its establishment in 1961 has provided assistance amounting to more than $14.5 billion to more than a hundred countries.   The State of Kuwait has also taken initiatives to stimulate economic growth  raise living standards and reduce poverty in States suffering from the increase in prices of basic food commodities. For this purpose  Kuwait has established the Decent Living Fund  with $100 million capital  and has allocated $300 million to fight poverty in Africa through the Islamic Development Bank.  Although Kuwait is a developing country  the percentage of humanitarian development aid that it provides exceeds the target adopted at international conferences  reaching 1.31 per cent of its gross national product  compared with 0.45 per cent of the gross national product of States members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).  Based on the State of Kuwait’s realization of the importance of economic cooperation and trade in consolidating relations between States  His Highness the Emir of the State of Kuwait  Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah  convened the first Arab Economic Summit  focusing on development  which Kuwait hosted last January. The Conference adopted a number of important and ambitious economic projects aimed at reaching new horizons of partnership and cooperation. Also adopted was the proposal by the State of Kuwait to establish a $1 billion fund  to which we will contribute $500 million  to support and finance small and medium-size development projects  which will help raise the standards of living of Arab citizens.  The June parliamentary elections in my country represented a qualitative transformation in Kuwaiti parliamentary life  with four women obtaining the trust and support of the Kuwaiti voters. They now join their brothers in representing the Kuwaiti people and expressing their ambitions under the dome of the National Assembly. This civilized accomplishment comes after Kuwaiti women have achieved success in the fields of private and public enterprise  as well as government work  including holding ministerial positions in the Kuwaiti Cabinet. We express our pride in  and appreciation of  the significant achievements of Kuwaiti women and will continue to support their role as active partners in the political  economic and social fields.    09-52463 38   We express much sorrow and pain that the question of Palestine has remained unresolved for over six decades  despite numerous international efforts and initiatives by a number of international and regional parties. A source of major concern is the deteriorating political  economic  social and humanitarian situation in the occupied Palestinian territories  including Jerusalem  as a result of the continued exercise by Israel  the occupying Power  of its illegal policies and practices  contrary to international law and relevant United Nations resolutions.  In this regard  we renew our condemnation of repeated Israeli aggression against the occupied territories  in particular  the military aggression against Gaza last December  in which more than 1 400 Palestinians  among them women  children and the elderly  were killed. That aggression also resulted in the unjustifiable destruction of homes  property and civilian infrastructure.   We call upon the international community  the Security Council in particular  to assume its responsibilities and take all necessary measures to stop Israel’s violation of international humanitarian law and its settlement activities as well as the policy of collective punishment it imposes on the Palestinian people. That policy is applied through its blockade of Gaza and its restriction of the freedom of access and movement of persons in all areas  including in the occupied territories. We also call for an immediate halt to Israel’s settlement activities  which are carried out under unacceptable pretexts.  The State of Kuwait also wishes to refer to the report (A/HRC/12/48) of the United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict  which clearly proves that the Israeli forces committed war crimes during the brutal aggression against Gaza last year. This represents a grave violation of international humanitarian law. Therefore  it is incumbent upon the Security Council and the broader United Nations to assume their responsibility to stop these crimes against humanity and to punish the perpetrators in accordance with international law.  Because of its moral and national responsibilities  as well as its steady support for the Palestinian cause  the State of Kuwait  in addition to supporting international efforts to improve living conditions in Gaza and to rebuild what the Israeli aggression against Gaza destroyed  has voluntarily pledged to donate $500 million  $200 million of which is to rebuild Gaza. This is a portion of its commitments within the context of the League of Arab States to support the Palestinian Authority.  Kuwait also took the initiative of responding to the appeal that the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) launched last December by donating the entire amount sought  $34 million  to cover the cost of urgently needed relief aid.  In this context  we believe that the suffering of the Palestinian people will continue until there is a permanent  just and comprehensive peace  which must mean ending the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories  the establishment of a Palestinian State  with Jerusalem as its capital  and total Israeli withdrawal from all Arab territories it has occupied since 4 June 1967  in implementation of relevant Security Council resolutions  the Road Map and the Arab Peace Initiative.  As for Iraq  the State of Kuwait commends the speedy efforts of the Iraqi Government to achieve peace  security  stability and prosperity for the Iraqi people. Kuwait supports every action that will preserve the sovereignty  national unity and territorial integrity of brotherly Iraq and ensure non-interference in its internal affairs. The State of Kuwait also condemns all acts of terrorism in Iraq aimed at destabilizing its security and stability and instigating detestable violent sectarianism.  To put an end to the so-called sectarian violence  it is important to resume the policy of dialogue and national reconciliation in order to ensure ample participation by all sectors of society in all phases of the political process  including the parliamentary elections to be held next January. The State of Kuwait will continue to support every effort to assist brotherly Iraq to regain its standing and natural position in its regional and international environment  in order to build a democratic  unified and peaceful Iraq  living in peace internally and with its neighbours  committed to fulfil its obligations as laid down in resolutions of international legitimacy.  The State of Kuwait hopes that the conflict over the occupied United Arab Emirates islands will be resolved by peaceful means. It calls upon the friendly Islamic Republic of Iran to settle the question through   39 09-52463  direct brotherly negotiations or by recourse to the International Court of Justice.  The resolution of conflicts and the settlement of differences between States  particularly in our region  must depend on a set of firm principles  deeply rooted in international relations  and emanating from resolutions of international legitimacy and the rules of international law. If necessary  a decision of the International Court of Justice must be sought to preserve good-neighbourly relations. That basis and those legal principles cannot be sidestepped to achieve the self-interests of one side at the expense of the other. In no case would that serve good-neighbourly relations or the building of mutual trust  and therefore it would affect the peace and stability of the parties  as well as international peace and security.  We followed with great interest yesterday’s Security Council summit (see S/PV.6191) addressing one of the most important matters affecting international peace and security  nuclear disarmament  in order to create a world free of nuclear weapons. We noted with satisfaction the unanimous adoption of Security Council resolution 1887 (2009)  which sets the stage for a world free of nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction  a world that fulfils the hopes of humanity and ensures the safety and prosperity of the world’s peoples.  While Kuwait supports the right of all States to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes  it reiterates its deep-rooted belief in the important need for disarmament of all weapons of mass destruction and for declaring the Middle East region a zone free from nuclear weapons. We renew our call to deal seriously with Israel  the only country in the region that did not adhere to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty  and call upon Israel to adhere to the Treaty and subject all its facilities to comprehensive International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards.  Kuwait also hopes that negotiations between the friendly Islamic Republic of Iran  the IAEA and other countries concerned will continue  with a view to reaching a peaceful solution to the Iranian nuclear issue in order to dispel the fears and doubts surrounding the nature and purpose of its programme.  In conclusion  it is our hope that joint political will can be mustered to achieve the noble purposes and principles of the Charter and to confront the serious challenges facing our world today.   There is also an urgent need to redouble our efforts to reject fanaticism and xenophobia  and to continue strengthening the dialogue between different civilizations and religions as the ideal mode for achieving understanding between cultures. This will create an appropriate environment to consolidate the principle of mutual respect and build bridges between societies."
"96",3940,"LAO",64,2009,"At the outset  on behalf of the Lao delegation  I would like to congratulate you  Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki  on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. I trust that  under your able presidency  our session will be guided to a successful outcome. Let me also take this opportunity to express our deepest appreciation to His Excellency Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann  who presided over the sixty-third session with dedication and distinction. By the same token  I convey our great appreciation to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his leadership and his commitment to the work of the Organization at a time when our world is facing numerous grave challenges.  In recent years  the international situation has undergone rapid changes and faced various challenges. The United Nations  a unique world body  has been playing an increasingly important role in maintaining international peace and security and promoting the peaceful settlement of disputes and international cooperation for development. In this rapidly changing world  it is our common duty and responsibility as Members of the United Nations to ensure that the Organization carry out its mandate effectively. To this end  United Nations reform is crucial and should be comprehensive  transparent and balanced  while the Organization should maintain its intergovernmental  universal and democratic character  consistent with the Charter.  The revitalization of the General Assembly  reform of the Security Council and the strengthening of the Economic and Social Council and specialized agencies should be guided by the principles of democracy  transparency and accountability with a view to making this universal Organization a body that truly represents the interests of all Member States and seeks their benefit. In this context  the Lao People’s Democratic Republic welcomes the launching of intergovernmental negotiations on Security Council reform and will continue to contribute to these important efforts in this new phase of the Security Council reform process.  The ongoing impasse within the multilateral disarmament machinery continues to undermine international peace and security. The existence of nuclear weapons remains a grave threat to the existence of all humankind. It is therefore vital to reaffirm the importance of States honouring their nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation obligations. The upcoming 2010 Review Conference will be a great opportunity for the States parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to demonstrate strong political commitment by making a collective effort to resolve the current stalemate on the non-proliferation and disarmament agenda. In this regard  it is encouraging that the third session of the Preparatory Committee for the 2010 Review Conference successfully adopted the agenda and all significant procedural decisions  which will undoubtedly lay an important foundation for a productive and successful Review Conference in 2010.  In conjunction with arms reduction and nuclear disarmament  the issue of explosive remnants of war  including cluster munitions and unexploded ordnance (UXO)  continues to threaten and pose serious obstacles to socio-economic development and poverty eradication efforts in more than 80 countries across the world. Among these  the Lao People’s Democratic Republic is the most affected. The victims of cluster munitions in the Lao People’s Democratic Republic — where approximately 300 victims have been recorded every year for the 30 years since the war ended — account for 50 per cent of the global total of cluster munitions victims. This is due to the fact that 37 per cent of national territory remains contaminated by UXO. Enormous financial resources would be needed   39 09-52586  to resolve this problem  and it would take a great length of time to clear UXOs from those areas needed most for development and the everyday livelihoods of communities. However  a precise estimate has yet to be made as to how many hundreds of years it would take to clear all UXO-contaminated areas across the country.  In light of the adverse impact of cluster munitions  the Lao People’s Democratic Republic attaches great importance to the Convention on banning and eradicating cluster munitions. In this context  we welcome and commend those countries that have signed and ratified the Convention  and hope that other countries that have not done so will follow suit so that Convention may enter into force as soon as possible. In order to prepare for the future implementation of the Convention  the Lao Government has offered to host the first conference of States parties to the Convention on Cluster Munitions after it enters into force. We hope that our offer will receive broad support from all countries and international organizations.  Despite the fact that peace  development and cooperation are the lodestars of our times  tensions  conflicts  violence  terrorism and threats to security persist in various parts of the world. The Lao People’s Democratic Republic is deeply dismayed by the prolonged conflict in the Middle East  which continues to inflict immense suffering on millions of people in the region  in particular the Palestinian people  who have been struggling to exercise their legitimate and inalienable rights to self-determination and statehood. Although we have heard in the course of our general debate many expressions of encouragement and renewed hope for addressing the Middle East problem  this can be realized only if all parties concerned demonstrate their commitment to addressing the impasse with a view to realizing the vision of two States  Israel and Palestine  living side by side in peace and security within recognized borders  in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the Security Council.  We also remain concerned over the decades-long economic  commercial and financial embargo imposed on the Republic of Cuba. It is now time to end these sanctions.  Climate change continues to be a pressing concern and to pose enormous challenges to the survival of humankind. Against this backdrop  global measures that conform to the principle of common but differentiated responsibility are urgently required. To this end  the integration of the three pillars of sustainable development — economic development  social development and environmental protection — should be enhanced with a view to effectively implementing the Bali Action Plan.   In this context  we highly commend the Secretary-General for his initiative to convene the high-level Summit on Climate Change on 22 September 2009  at which world leaders had the opportunity to discuss concrete measures and potential solutions to the consequences of climate change  as well as to prepare for the Climate Change Conference to be held in Copenhagen  Denmark. Furthermore  world leaders have made strong commitments to taking the necessary action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions  promote the green economy  provide mitigation and adaptation assistance  and generate alternative energy  including through technology transfer from developed to developing countries  in order to enable the latter to adapt to the consequences and impacts of climate change.  The Lao People’s Democratic Republic welcomes and supports the recommendation to launch a new Global Compact entailing a green New Deal  which would no doubt provide an excellent platform for addressing the current global challenges  promoting investment in the green economy  laying the foundations to deal with the crucial long-term issues  and helping to create a future based on a low-carbon economy  renewable energy and energy efficiency.  The multiple global crises  especially the financial and economic crises  have had many adverse effects on developing countries  in particular on the most vulnerable groups. This is due primarily to the lack of basic infrastructure  access to markets  resources and modern technology  and to the fact that capacity to provide financing and investment remains low. In response  various forms of consultation and approach have been undertaken in an attempt to mitigate the long-term impacts of the crisis. In this regard  we welcome the initiatives of the Group of Eight  the Group of 20 and other international forums to build a mechanism that will help find solutions to the crisis  including the recommendations of the high-level Conference on the World Financial and Economic Crisis held here in June this year.    09-52586 40   As one of the most vulnerable countries in the world  the Lao People’s Democratic Republic is of the view that all initiatives and measures undertaken must be implemented effectively and in a timely manner. In particular  it is important to address the unpredictability and vulnerability of commodity markets  provide preferential treatment to goods from developing countries  especially those from the most vulnerable ones  ensure the smooth resolution of debt issues  improve technology transfer mechanism and reform the international financial system.   The fourth United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries  to be held in early 2011  will provide a good opportunity for the international community to review its responsibilities and commitments pledged to the least developed countries  as well as to identify obstacles and constraints and seek possible solutions to them  particularly in the wake of such a profound economic and financial crisis.  The solid political stability and social order in the Lao People’s Democratic Republic have provided favourable conditions for national economic development. Nevertheless  the Lao People’s Democratic Republic has also been adversely affected at a certain level by the recent global economic and financial crisis. The crisis has caused a slowdown in economic development  with growth of the main economic sectors such as industry  services and agriculture decreasing by 2 to 3 per cent. The trade sector was also affected  with exports dropping by 28 per cent.   Against this backdrop  the Lao Government has undertaken urgent action by identifying eight measures and 80 priority areas to address. As a result of such action  the Lao People’s Democratic Republic has been able to mitigate the adverse impact of the crisis to a certain degree. However  owing to the uncertainty of today’s global economy  the Lao People’s Democratic Republic  like other developing countries  remains vulnerable and still needs the support and cooperation from the international community to respond to the crisis  with a view to preventing long-term impacts  which may occur at any time  and to achieving the Millennium Development Goals and our ultimate national goal of being removed from the list of least developed countries by 2020.  Today  more than ever  the international community has the responsibility  as well as the opportunity  to promote solidarity and strengthen international cooperation in jointly addressing these global problems  as no country can weather alone the threats and challenges confronting it. In this spirit  the Lao People’s Democratic Republic reiterates its unshakable commitment to continue full cooperation with the international community in pursuit of a world free from fear and want  rooted in a new  just and equitable order. I believe that  with great solidarity  we will be able to achieve the aforementioned goals."
"97",3983,"LBN",64,2009,"I should like at the outset to congratulate Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session and to express my appreciation to his predecessor  Father Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann  for his efforts. I should also like to thank in particular His Excellency the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  for his comprehensive annual report on the work of the Organization (A/64/1) and for the special attention that he has consistently devoted to the concerns of Lebanon and its people.  Lebanon closely follows all political  economic  social and legal issues on the agenda of the General Assembly  and we are hopeful and confident that we will be elected as a non-permanent member of the Security Council for the period 2010-2011  with the full support of brotherly and friendly nations in that regard. Lebanon looks forward to that election with great confidence  because we are a founding member of this universal international Organization and contributed significantly to the drafting of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.   For thousands of years  the people of Lebanon have made vital contributions to the development of civilization  including innovations that have promoted communication  interaction and dialogue among nations and peoples. These are the same people who set sail in search of new horizons of cooperation and communication and have played a vital role in spreading the values of freedom and democracy  reinforcing the concept of Arab nationalism and establishing the pillars of the intellectual and literary renaissance of the Arab world.  Today  from this rostrum  Lebanon reaffirms its commitment to the Charter of the United Nations and to the resolutions of international legitimacy  in particular Security Council resolution 1701 (2006)  as well as its willingness to contribute seriously and responsibly to the deliberations and resolutions of the Council for the coming two years  especially those aimed at ensuring peace and security in the Middle East. Furthermore  Lebanon will give special consideration to the deliberations on reform of the United Nations and its organs that will enable it to become more effective in addressing the challenges of today’s world.  Therefore  it comes as no surprise that the Lebanese Constitution  which was adopted in 1926  two decades before the United Nations was established  stipulates that “There shall be absolute freedom of conscience. The State ... shall respect all religions and creeds and guarantees under its protection  and the free exercise of all religious rites”.     09-52463 16   The model of coexistence embodied by Lebanon  which allows various confessional communities to participate actively in its political life in an environment of democracy and freedom of thought and expression  runs counter to all trends towards ethnic or religious cleansing and doctrines of the single-thought theory. That is why  last year  I called for the establishment of Lebanon as an internationally recognized centre for dialogue among civilizations  cultures and religions  in keeping with our role as a bridge of communication between East and West and our message as a country in which 18 different communities interact in a unique and exemplary manner.  One of the primary tasks entrusted to the Security Council is to strive to maintain international peace and security. Indeed  it is very unfortunate that the Arab Middle East  a region that gave rise to the three monotheistic religions  has been an area of tension  conflict and war ever since the Nakba  the tragedy that befell Palestine in 1948 and displaced its people.  Any settlement of the Middle East crisis must be based on a predetermined and comprehensive plan whose basic elements have been set out in the resolutions of international legitimacy  at the Madrid Peace Conference and in the Arab Peace Initiative. Above all  such a settlement requires the genuine political will of the parties to commit themselves to peace and its obligations.   However  the Israeli side has not demonstrated such will  because the soundness and usefulness of a just peace are still being discussed both by the Government and at the grass-roots level in Israel. Furthermore  Israeli threats of attacks and wars continue as ways to exert control and hegemony and impose a fait accompli  if not to bring about expansion  displacement and further encroachment on the rights of Palestinians and Arabs. Meanwhile  Arab countries have together introduced a comprehensive Peace Initiative  which was unanimously adopted at the 2002 Arab League Summit  held in Beirut.   It is thus essential that the international community take appropriate measures to compel Israel to fulfil its international obligations under the peace process within a specific and reasonable time frame  in accordance with the Declaration of the recent Arab League Summit held in Doha  Qatar. How can we persuade our peoples that the international community is capable of achieving a just and comprehensive peace and thus of putting an end to the various aspects of the Middle East conflict  including through an Israeli withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories and the establishment of an independent and sovereign Palestinian State with Al-Quds as its capital  if it cannot force Israel to halt its settlement construction  lift its unjust siege on Gaza and stop the Judaization of Jerusalem?  In that context  it is important to note that people have the right to reclaim their occupied territories by all legitimate and available means  in accordance with the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations and the relevant United Nations resolutions. Everyone here knows how Lebanon was able to liberate most of its territories occupied by Israel in the spring of 2000 after Israel had refused to implement resolution 425 (1978)  which called for its immediate and unconditional withdrawal from all Lebanese territories. That occupation lasted 22 continuous years.  Our meeting this year coincides with the sixtieth anniversary of the establishment of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA). On this occasion  Lebanon would like to stress that the Palestinian refugees’ solution is first and foremost a political solution. We fully support all efforts aimed at reinforcing the programmes and capabilities of UNRWA  enabling it to improve the living standards and human conditions of the refugees  in collaboration with the host countries  until a just and final solution to the tragedy of the Palestinians has been reached.  Clearly  such a just and final solution for the Palestinian refugees cannot deny them their natural and legitimate right of return to their lands and homes  nor can it be achieved without the host countries’ participation or in violation of their sovereignty  their special circumstances and their national interests. This is why Lebanon rejects any form of settling Palestinian refugees on its territories  for by such rejection it upholds the Palestinian refugees’ right of return  in accordance with Lebanon’s Constitution and national pact. Let it be clear that such a position will not be reversed. Nor will it be subject to compromise or negotiation. I take this opportunity to express our gratitude to the countries that have lent their support to the Lebanese position on this issue and shown a willingness to defend it.   17 09-52463   Throughout last year  Lebanon was able to maintain its internal stability and dismantle many Israeli spy networks and terrorist cells while striving to implement resolution 1701 (2006) and strengthen its relations with brotherly and friendly countries. Furthermore  Lebanon was able to hold parliamentary elections. The world witnessed the transparency and integrity of those elections  and the results were accepted by all competing parties. Lebanon has also been able to improve its credibility  avoid the aftermath of the global financial crisis  attract many tourists and investors  and raise its economic growth rate to almost 6 per cent. It is now preparing to host the sixth Francophone Games in a few days.  While parliamentary consultations are taking place in accordance with constitutional provisions and the requirement to forge a national consensus  we are looking forward to forming a national unity government very soon. Such a government would reinstate government dynamics and launch the political  administrative and judicial reform process the Lebanese people aspire to. The fruits of such a process will serve the people and the authorities  thus ensuring its success and continuity.  In parallel  and on the third anniversary of the adoption of resolution 1701 (2006)  Lebanon stresses that Israel should be forced to comply with all the provisions of that resolution  especially its withdrawal from all the Lebanese occupied territories  including the Shaba’a farms  the Kfarshouba hills and the northern part of the village of Ghajar  to stop its daily violations of Lebanon’s sovereignty and its persistent threats against Lebanon  its institutions and infrastructure.  In this context  Lebanon would like to commend the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) for the role it is playing in the south of the country  in accordance with the rules of engagement agreed upon and in full coordination with the Lebanese Army. In addition  Lebanon would like to reaffirm that it remains keen to preserve the safety of this Force and reiterates its appreciation for the efforts deployed by its commander and soldiers and for their sacrifices in the service of peace and stability.  Lebanon will pursue its international efforts to force Israel to pay due compensation for the enormous damage it caused through its repeated acts of aggression against Lebanon  including the damage caused by the oil slick resulting from the Israeli bombardment of the Jiyeh power plant in the summer of 2006.  The experience acquired over the past 61 years has confirmed a set of truths. First  the Palestinian cause is at the core of the Middle East conflict. Secondly  Israel’s resorting to force to impose a fait accompli is futile and will weaken neither the will nor the determination of the Arab people to restore their rights. Thirdly  partial and unilateral solutions will not achieve genuine peace  and unjust solutions are short-lived.  Since the middle of the last century  the world has witnessed fundamental political  intellectual and ideological shifts that have had a profound impact on nations and their interactions  along with a troubling accumulation of economic  social and environmental predicaments. No matter how local or regional some conflicts and crises have been in the past  in the current era of globalization they have become global in nature or acquired a global dimension. Such has been the case for the phenomenon of international terrorism  the global financial crisis and the contagious diseases that are spreading across continents.  In ancient times  and now in the modern world  as told in the fiercest epic tales  wars beget tragic and painful events and give rise to costly and horrific experiences where endless blood and countless tears are shed and disappointment and tragedies prevail. We therefore hope that the United Nations  which from the outset was established to prevent wars and resolve conflicts through peaceful means  will persist in its endeavour to achieve righteousness and establish justice through active and unbiased international efforts."
"98",4029,"LBR",64,2009,"My delegation and I are honoured  for the second time  to address the General Assembly on behalf of President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and the Government and people of Liberia. We congratulate Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki and his country  the Socialist People’s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya  on his election as President of the Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. We are convinced that  as a consummate diplomat  Mr. Treki will bring his wealth of experience into play as we tackle the complex issues on the current session’s agenda  while entertaining hopes for a resounding success. In this context  my delegation and I assure the President of our full cooperation.  Permit me  therefore  to seize the opportunity to pay a well-deserved tribute to the preceding President  His Excellency Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann of the Republic of Nicaragua  for the very able and effective manner in which he steered the affairs of the Assembly’s sixty-third session. His sound and shrewd leadership was critical in steadying the turbulence occasioned by the severe global economic and financial crisis. Likewise  we commend the Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon  a visionary statesman  for the unfaltering efforts with which he continues to administer the affairs of this Organization. His renewed dynamism and sense of purpose serve as an impetus to our collective aspirations for the attainment of global peace  security and development.  Liberia continues to make steady progress under the excellent  indefatigable leadership of Her Excellency President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf. Since her inauguration in January 2006 as the first democratically elected woman head of State of an African country  the Government has undertaken a number of important initiatives aimed at enhancing national dialogue and reconciliation.   On 30 June 2009  the Truth and Reconciliation Commission submitted an unedited report  which did not gain the unanimous consent of the Commission  since two members issued dissenting views. Nonetheless  since its release the report has spurred national debate  and the President has committed herself to working with all stakeholders towards implementation of the recommendations  which must be in consonance with the Commission’s mandate  the wishes of the Liberian people and the laws of our country.  In order to protect the fundamental rights of the Liberian people  the President has also nominated the members of the Independent Human Rights Commission  which will have the responsibility of monitoring the implementation of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission report. Under the Liberian Constitution  the nominees must meet the consent of the Liberian Senate  and that process is currently under way. We have also established the Land Commission  and its Commissioners have been appointed to address the explosive issues of land disputes and the need for land reform.  We note with satisfaction the achievement of the national disarmament  demobilization  rehabilitation and reintegration programme  carried out in conjunction with the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL). That programme was successfully concluded in July of this year. However  high unemployment  especially among the youth  remains a major challenge.   Liberia is pleased with the progress being made in the reconstitution of its armed forces  which includes the training of the 2 000-strong army with the assistance of our development partners  particularly the United States of America. We continue to encourage gender sensitivity in this important area of our national endeavours  considering that at present there are only 58 women in the new force.  Improvements have also been registered in the performance of the reorganized Liberia National Police force  with the establishment of an emergency unit. The police  however  continue to face difficulties in achieving full operational capability in the areas of infrastructure  equipment  logistics and other requirements. Two weeks ago  successful partnership consultations were held at United Nations Headquarters here in New York on the strategic plan   25 09-52470  for the Liberia National Police. The responses of our partners  especially India  were encouraging. The objective of the strategic plan is to introduce an integrated programme that would ensure a consistent doctrine and training philosophy to enhance continuity. A similar strategic plan is also required for the Bureau of Immigration and Naturalization to improve its efficiency and effectiveness in border control.  We are pleased to report that Liberia has continued to make significant strides in the administration of justice and rule of law  in spite of daunting obstacles. We have established a special sexual and gender-based violent crimes court  which has begun hearing cases and encouraging victims to come forth and report on those crimes in the spirit of confidentiality and justice. Concomitantly  the Government has further adopted several gender-sensitive policies and frameworks in pursuance of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000).  Post-conflict reconstruction and development require all Liberians to participate in the ongoing recovery and sustainable development efforts. The Government is therefore promoting and encouraging women’s involvement at the leadership level and in all other spectrums of society  with emphasis on the education of the girl child.   In this connection  I wish to refer to the International Colloquium on Women’s Empowerment  Leadership Development  International Peace and Security  which was co-convened by the President of Liberia  Her Excellency Madam Ellen Johnson Sirleaf  and the President of Finland  Her Excellency Madam Tarja Halonen  in Monrovia on 7 and 8 March 2009. At that event  the Monrovia Declaration was adopted  calling for action on resolution 1325 (2000) on women  peace and security  and on climate change and gender. We want to thank all our partners and friends of the international community  including the institutions of the United Nations system and UNMIL  who contributed to the success of the programme.  In that regard  we reaffirm that resolution 1325 (2000) on women  peace and security recognizes that women  as civilians in conflict situations  are not only victims but also powerful agents for peace and the security for their communities.  We also recognize that Security Council resolution 1820 (2008) is an important component of resolution 1325 (2000) with regard to rape and sexual violence against women and girls. Therefore  we recommend that the Secretary-General appoint a special envoy on women  peace and security who would galvanize Member States to implement resolution 1325 (2000) and ensure that the path towards its tenth anniversary is well prepared in a coherent manner.  As a follow-up to the Monrovia extraordinary meeting  a side event to this sixty-fourth session of the General Assembly was jointly hosted yesterday by those two exemplary women leaders  here at United Nations Headquarters  to focus on the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) and climate change. In commending them for their excellent work  we join in their appeal to all Member States  Governments and non-governmental organizations to support the Monrovia Declaration. Liberia wishes to thank all the participants at that historic event for renewing their support of the Government of Liberia and for reform of the United Nations system  including the urgent need for gender equality in its organs and related agencies.  Liberia’s economic revitalization is shaping up to become a post-conflict success story  due to the combination of the disciplined leadership and prudent policies of Her Excellency President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf and the very constructive partnership with the international community. We remain cognizant of the fact that no amount of foreign assistance can transform a nation in the absence of sound moral leadership and technical competencies and of the commitment to improve the well-being of its citizens. It is out of this realization that we formulated the Government’s poverty reduction strategy and have cultivated a strategic partnership with friendly countries and organizations within the international community.  The country experienced 7 per cent growth in 2008 and is expected to register 5 per cent this year  largely as a result of the negative impact of the global economic meltdown on demand for our major commodities and decreased capital inflows. National revenue collection rose by 25 per cent last year. We have improved our business and investment climate by establishing the “One Stop Shop” concept to spur private sector growth and create jobs.   We have rehabilitated a total of 674 miles of primary and secondary roads to link communities that were isolated from the central administration as a result of the 14-year civil crisis. A robust and comprehensive    09-52470 26  civil service reform strategy has been instituted as a critical component of the public sector reform. Moreover  the President has promulgated a policy of mandatory free and compulsory primary education  with a special emphasis on girls  who are often victims of institutionalized bias and abuse.  We have undertaken several economic reform initiatives and have set up the Liberia Anti-Corruption Commission to create a transparent and predictable business and investment climate as well as to encourage greater foreign direct investment.  Liberia has also made noticeable progress towards reaching the targets for relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative. Qualifying under this process will open up the country to borrowing on the international financial markets and accepting loans.  While Liberia has made and continues to make impressive progress towards consolidating peace  the gains remain fragile. In post-conflict situations such as ours  stability is linked to development. Weak institutional capacity in the area of the rule of law  coupled with the absence of employment opportunities  especially for the youth  continue to threaten sustained progress.   As we expect to hold general elections in 2011  successful conduct of these undertakings will set the nation firmly on the path of stability and democracy. It is therefore envisioned that continued  sustainable socio-economic development will serve as the catalyst for a smooth electoral process.  The Mano River Union countries of Liberia  Sierra Leone  Guinea and Côte d’Ivoire continue to host significant numbers of each other’s refugees in the subregion. For instance  more than 65 000 Liberian refugees are reportedly spread throughout West Africa  posing humanitarian challenges that require urgent action for cross-border movements. This is why we continue to urge the fast-tracking and relaxation of the stringent conditions for development assistance  if Liberia is to truly remain a model for post-conflict reconstruction and democracy.  In this connection  Liberia requires the empathy and support of the international community for its young democracy as it improves the human rights situation  transparency  anti-corruption and good governance  which are important priorities of the Government.  In this vein  we wish to express the heartfelt gratitude of the Government and people of Liberia to the Security Council for extending the mandate of UNMIL for another year and further requesting it to provide a conducive security environment for the holding of general and presidential elections in 2011. The crucial nature of this democratic transition cannot be overemphasized as we commend the gallant men and women of UNMIL for their courageous and sacrificial services in keeping the peace.  The issue of cross-border movement mentioned above demonstrates that the security and stability of the countries of the Mano River Union subregion are inextricably linked and that progress in one country cannot be divorced from progress in any one of the member States. Elections are soon to be held in Côte d’Ivoire and Guinea. As Chair of the Mano River Union and a member of the International Contact Group on Guinea  President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf is urging the United Nations and the international community to stay constructively engaged with Guinea while urging adherence to the original agreement so as to ensure a smooth transition to democratic rule in that country.  Cross-border movements among the Mano River Union countries have become more complex and problematic due to the growing number of cases involving illicit drug trafficking  human trafficking and other organized transnational crime in the West African subregion and beyond. These problems necessitate the urgent need for collective international action to tackle these criminal activities  which are a menace to regional peace and security.  Liberia supports the decision of the leaders of the Southern African Development Community on the lifting of United Nations sanctions against Zimbabwe. We are encouraged that the power-sharing agreement between the parties continues to hold as the country tries to recover.  As regards Somalia  we note with regret the continuing deterioration of the situation in that country. In view of the unfortunate state of affairs there  Liberia calls for renewed commitment by the international community to provide logistical and financial support to the African Union peacekeeping initiatives to restore peace in that country. Liberia  as a beneficiary of   27 09-52470  peacekeeping operations  registers its strong condemnation of the recent barbaric killings of 17 African Union peacekeepers in Somalia.   On Darfur  we are heartened by the expressed willingness of all the parties to end armed hostilities and to find a political solution to the problem that will ensure lasting peace for all people in that region.  Liberia welcomes the just-ended Summit on Climate Change convened by the Secretary-General. We firmly believe that urgent action is needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to help all Member States  particularly developing countries  adequately respond to the harmful effects of this global phenomenon.  Liberia continues to join in the call for a democratic Security Council that reflects the realities of the twenty-first century. The world today is far different from and more complex than that of the 1940s  when this Organization came into being.  Liberia supports peacekeeping operations to put out the flames of war. However  we wish to underscore the benefits of establishing an early warning mechanism that will deal with potentially explosive situations before they escalate into full blown conflagrations that present only ghastly choices.  Additionally  it is important that the international community provides special assistance and dispensation to post-conflict countries to shield them from shocks in the worldwide system  such as the current global financial crisis. These upsets often have the effect of reversing the gains made in restoring peace to countries emerging from conflict.  That is why Liberia welcomes the empathy and support of the international community in rebuilding its institutions destroyed by protracted civil conflict. The current global financial crisis is impregnated with the potential to undermine donor support to our national renewal agenda  thus threatening much needed foreign direct investment and delivery of social services.  The result of the Government’s inability to provide these basic services to its people has the propensity to provide fertile ground for acts of destabilization from internal and external sources. It is cheaper to prevent these risks than to have to mobilize already diminishing resources at much higher cost  sometimes involving human lives and enormous resources  to react to them.  In conclusion  we pledge our unstinting support to your leadership and entertain the hope that together  we can advance the cause of humanity and make the world truly a better place to live."
"99",4074,"LBY",64,2009,"In the name of the African Union  I would like to greet the members of the General Assembly of the United Nations  and I hope that this meeting will be among the most historic in the history of the world.  In the name of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session  presided over by Libya  of the African Union  of one thousand traditional African kingdoms and in my own name  I would like to take this opportunity  as President of the African Union  to congratulate our son Obama because he is attending the General Assembly  and we welcome him as his country is hosting this meeting.  This session is taking place in the midst of so many challenges facing us  and the whole world should come together and unite its efforts to defeat the challenges that are our principal common enemy — those of climate change and international crises such as the capitalist economic decline  the food and water crises  desertification  terrorism  immigration  piracy  man-made and natural epidemics and nuclear proliferation. Perhaps influenza H1N1 was a virus created in a laboratory that got out of control  originally being meant as a military weapon. Such challenges also include hypocrisy  poverty  fear  materialism and immorality.   As is known  the United Nations was founded by three or four countries against Germany at the time. The United Nations was formed by the nations that joined together against Germany in the Second World War. Those countries formed a body called the Security Council  made its own countries permanent members and granted them the power of veto. We were not present at that time. The United Nations was shaped in line with those three countries and wanted us to step into shoes originally designed against Germany. That is the real substance of the United Nations when it was founded over 60 years ago.  That happened in the absence of some 165 countries  at a ratio of one to eight; that is  one was present and eight were absent. They created the Charter  of which I have a copy. If one reads the Charter of the United Nations  one finds that the Preamble of the Charter differs from its Articles. How did it come into existence? All those who attended the San Francisco Conference in 1945 participated in creating the Preamble  but they left the Articles and internal rules of procedures of the so-called Security    09-52179 16  Council to experts  specialists and interested countries  which were those countries that had established the Security Council and had united against Germany.   The Preamble is very appealing  and no one objects to it  but all the provisions that follow it completely contradict the Preamble. We reject such provisions  and we will never uphold them; they ended with the Second World War. The Preamble says that all nations  small or large  are equal. Are we equal when it comes to the permanent seats? No  we are not equal. The Preamble states in writing that all nations are equal whether they are small or large. Do we have the right of veto? Are we equal? The Preamble says that we have equal rights  whether we are large or small. That is what is stated and what we agreed in the Preamble. So the veto contradicts the Charter. The permanent seats contradict the Charter. We neither accept nor recognize the veto.   The Preamble of the Charter states that armed force shall not be used  save in the common interest. That is the Preamble that we agreed to and signed  and we joined the United Nations because we wanted the Charter to reflect that. It says that armed force shall only be used in the common interest of all nations  but what has happened since then? Sixty-five wars have broken out since the establishment of the United Nations and the Security Council — 65 since their creation  with millions more victims than in the Second World War. Are those wars  and the aggression and force that were used in those 65 wars  in the common interest of us all? No  they were in the interest of one or three or four countries  but not of all nations.   We will talk about whether those wars were in the interest of one country or of all nations. That flagrantly contradicts the Charter of the United Nations that we signed  and unless we act in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations to which we agreed  we will reject it and not be afraid not to speak diplomatically to anyone. Now we are talking about the future of the United Nations. There should be no hypocrisy or diplomacy because it concerns the important and vital issue of the future of the world. It was hypocrisy that brought about the 65 wars since the establishment of the United Nations.  The Preamble also states that if armed force is used  it must be a United Nations force — thus  military intervention by the United Nations  with the joint agreement of the United Nations  not one or two or three countries using armed force. The entire United Nations will decide to go to war to maintain international peace and security. Since the establishment of the United Nations in 1945  if there is an act of aggression by one country against another  the entire United Nations should deter and stop that act.   If a country  Libya for instance  were to exhibit aggression against France  then the entire Organization would respond because France is a sovereign State Member of the United Nations and we all share the collective responsibility to protect the sovereignty of all nations. However  65 aggressive wars have taken place without any United Nations action to prevent them. Eight other massive  fierce wars  whose victims number some 2 million  have been waged by Member States that enjoy veto powers. Those countries that would have us believe they seek to maintain the sovereignty and independence of peoples actually use aggressive force against peoples. While we would like to believe that these countries want to work for peace and security in the world and protect peoples  they have instead resorted to aggressive wars and hostile behaviour. Enjoying the veto they granted themselves as permanent members of the Security Council  they have initiated wars that have claimed millions of victims.  The principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of States is enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. No country  therefore  has the right to interfere in the affairs of any Government  be it democratic or dictatorial  socialist or capitalist  reactionary or progressive. This is the responsibility of each society; it is an internal matter for the people of the country concerned. The senators of Rome once appointed their leader  Julius Caesar  as dictator because it was good for Rome at that time. No one can say of Rome at that time that it gave Caesar the veto. The veto is not mentioned in the Charter.   We joined the United Nations because we thought we were equals  only to find that one country can object to all the decisions we make. Who gave the permanent members their status in the Security Council? Four of them granted this status to themselves. The only country that we in this Assembly elected to permanent member status in the Security Council is China. This was done democratically  but the other seats were imposed upon us undemocratically through a dictatorial procedure carried out against our will  and we should not accept it.   17 09-52179   The Security Council reform we need is not an increase in the number of members  which would only make things worse. To use a common expression  if you add more water  you get more mud. It would add insult to injury. It would make things worse simply by adding more large countries to those that already enjoy membership of the Council. It would merely perpetuate the proliferation of super-Powers. We therefore reject the addition of any more permanent seats. The solution is not to have more permanent seats  which would be very dangerous. Adding more super-Powers would crush the peoples of small  vulnerable and third world countries  which are coming together in what has been called the Group of 100 — 100 small countries banding together in a forum that one member has called the Forum of Small States.   These countries would be crushed by super-Powers were additional large countries to be granted membership in the Security Council. This door must be closed; we reject it strongly and categorically. Adding more seats to the Security Council would increase poverty  injustice and tension at the world level  as well as great competition between certain countries such as Italy  Germany  Indonesia  India  Pakistan  the Philippines  Japan  Brazil  Nigeria  Argentina  Algeria  Libya  Egypt  the Democratic Republic of the Congo  South Africa  Tanzania  Turkey  Iran  Greece and Ukraine. All these countries would seek a seat on the Security Council  making its membership almost as large as that of the General Assembly and resulting in an impractical competition.  What solution can there be? The solution is for the General Assembly to adopt a binding resolution under the leadership of Mr. Treki based on the majority will of Assembly members and taking into account the considerations of no other body. The solution is to close Security Council membership to the admission of further States. This item is on the agenda of the General Assembly during the present session presided over by Mr. Treki. Membership through unions and the transference of mandates should supersede other proposals.  We should focus on the achievement of democracy based on the equality of Member States. There should be equality among Member States and the powers and mandates of the Security Council should be transferred to the General Assembly. Membership should be for unions  not for States. Increasing the number of States Members would give the right to all countries to a seat  in accordance with the spirit of the Preamble of the Charter.   No country could deny a seat in the Council to Italy  for instance  if a seat were given to Germany. For the sake of argument  Italy might say that Germany was an aggressive country and was defeated in the Second World War. If we gave India a seat  Pakistan would say that it  too  is a nuclear country and deserves a seat  and those two countries are at war. This would be a dangerous situation. If we gave a seat to Japan  then we should have to give one to Indonesia  the largest Muslim country in the world. Then Turkey  Iran and Ukraine would make the same claim. What could we say to Argentina or Brazil? Libya deserves a seat for its efforts in the service of world security by discarding its weapons of mass destruction programme. Then South Africa  Tanzania and Ukraine would demand the same. All of these countries are important. The door to Security Council membership should be closed.  This approach is a falsehood  a trick that has been exposed. If we want to reform the United Nations  bringing in more super-Powers is not the way. The solution is to foster democracy at the level of the general congress of the world  the General Assembly  to which the powers of the Security Council should be transferred. The Security Council would become merely an instrument for implementing the decisions taken by the General Assembly  which would be the parliament  the legislative assembly  of the world.   This Assembly is our democratic forum and the Security Council should be responsible before it; we should not accept the current situation. These are the legislators of the Members of the United Nations  and their resolutions should be binding. It is said that the General Assembly should do whatever the Security Council recommends. On the contrary  the Security Council should do whatever the General Assembly decides. This is the United Nations  the Assembly that includes 192 countries. It is not the Security Council  which includes only 15 of the Member States.  How can we be happy about global peace and security if the whole world is controlled by only five countries? We are 192 nations and countries  and we are like Speakers’ Corner in London’s Hyde Park. We just speak and nobody implements our decisions. We are mere decoration  without any real substance. We are Speakers’ Corner  no more  no less. We just make    09-52179 18  speeches and then disappear. This is who you are right now.  Once the Security Council becomes only an executive body for resolutions adopted by the General Assembly  there will be no competition for membership of the Council. Once the Security Council becomes a tool to implement General Assembly resolutions  there will be no need for any competition. The Security Council should  quite simply  represent all nations. In accordance with the proposal submitted to the General Assembly  there would be permanent seats on the Security Council for all unions and groups of countries.  The 27 countries of the European Union should have a permanent seat on the Security Council. The countries of the African Union should have a permanent seat on the Security Council. The Latin American and ASEAN countries should have permanent seats. The Russian Federation and the United States of America are already permanent members of the Security Council. The Southern African Development Community (SADC)  once it is fully established  should have a permanent seat. The 22 countries of the Arab League should have a permanent seat. The 57 countries of the Islamic Conference should have a permanent seat. The 118 countries of the Non-Aligned Movement should have a permanent seat.  Then there is the G-100; perhaps the small countries should also have a permanent seat. Countries not included in the unions that I have mentioned could perhaps be assigned a permanent seat  to be occupied by them in rotation every six or twelve months. I am thinking of countries like Japan and Australia that are outside such organizations as ASEAN or like the Russian Federation that is not a member of the European or Latin American or African unions. This would be a solution for them if the General Assembly votes in favour of it.  The issue is a vitally important one. As has already been mentioned  the General Assembly is the Congress and Parliament of the world  the leader of the world. We are the nations  and anyone outside this General Assembly will not be recognized. The President of the Assembly  Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki  and Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon will produce the legal draft and set up the necessary committees to submit this proposal to a vote: that from now on  the Security Council will be made up of unions of nations. In this way  we will have justice and democracy  and we will no longer have a Security Council consisting of countries which have been chosen because they have nuclear weapons  large economies or advanced technology. That is terrorism. We cannot allow the Security Council to be run by super-Powers; that is terrorism in and of itself.  If we want a world that is united  safe and peaceful  this is what we should do. If we want to remain in a world at war  that is up to you. We will continue to have conflict and to fight until doomsday or the end of the world. All Security Council members should have the right to exercise the veto  or else we should eliminate the whole concept of the veto with this new formation of the Council. This would be a real Security Council. According to the new proposals submitted to the General Assembly  it will be an executive council under the control of the General Assembly  which will have the real power and make all the rules.  In this way  all countries will be on an equal footing in the Security Council just as they are in the General Assembly. In the General Assembly we are all treated equally when it comes to membership and voting. It should be the same in the Security Council. Currently  one country has a veto; another country does not have a veto; one country has a permanent seat; another country does not have a permanent seat. We should not accept this  nor should we accept any resolution adopted by the Security Council in its current composition. We were under trusteeship; we were colonized; and now we are independent. We are here today to decide the future of the world in a democratic way that will maintain the peace and security of all nations  large and small  as equals. Otherwise  it is terrorism  for terrorism is not just Al-Qaida but can also take other forms.  We should be guided by the majority of the votes in the General Assembly alone. If the General Assembly takes a decision by voting  then its wishes should be obeyed and its decision should be enforced. No one is above the General Assembly; anyone who says he is above the Assembly should leave the United Nations and be on his own. Democracy is not for the rich or the most powerful or for those who practise terrorism. All nations should be and should be seen to be on an equal footing.   19 09-52179   At present  the Security Council is security feudalism  political feudalism for those with permanent seats  protected by them and used against us. It should be called  not the Security Council  but the Terror Council. In our political life  if they need to use the Security Council against us  they turn to the Security Council. If they have no need to use it against us  they ignore the Security Council. If they have an interest to promote  an axe to grind  they respect and glorify the Charter of the United Nations; they turn to Chapter VII of the Charter and use it against poor nations. If  however  they wished to violate the Charter  they would ignore it as if it did not exist at all.  If the veto of the permanent members of the Security Council is given to those who have the power  this is injustice and terrorism and should not be toloerated by us. We should not live in the shadow of this injustice and terror.  Super-Powers have complicated global interests  and they use the veto to protect those interests. For example  in the Security Council  they use the power of the United Nations to protect their interests and to terrorize and intimidate the Third World  causing it to live under the shadow of terror.  From the beginning  since it was established in 1945  the Security Council has failed to provide security. On the contrary  it has provided terror and sanctions. It is only used against us. For this reason  we will no longer be committed to implementing Security Council resolutions after this speech  which marks the 40th anniversary.  Sixty-five wars have broken out: either fighting among small countries or wars of aggression waged against us by super-Powers. The Security Council  in clear violation of the Charter of the United Nations  failed to take action to stop these wars or acts of aggressions against small nations and peoples.  The General Assembly will vote on a number of historic proposals. Either we act as one or we will fragment. If each nation were to have its own version of the General Assembly  the Security Council and the various instruments and each were to have an equal footing  the Powers that currently fill the permanent seats would be confinded to use of their own soverign bodies  whether there be three or four of them  and would have to exercise their rights against themselves. This is of no concern to us.  If they want to keep their permanent seats  that is fine; permanent seats will be of no concern to us. We shall never submit to their control or to their exercise of the veto that was given to them. We are not so foolish as to give the right of veto to the super-Powers to use so they can treat us as second-class citizens and as outcast nations. It is not we who decided that those countries are the super-Powers and respected nations with the power to act on behalf of 192 countries.  You should be fully aware that we are ignoring the Security Council resolutions because those resolutions are used solely against us and not against the super-Powers which have the permanent seats and the right of veto. Those Powers never use any resolutions against themselves.  They are  however  used against us. Such use has turned the United Nations into a travesty of itself and has generated wars and violations of the sovereignty of independent States. It has led to war crimes and genocides. All of this is in violation of the Charter of the United Nations.  Since no one pays attention to the Security Council of the United Nations  each country and community has established its own security council  and the Security Council here has become isolated.  The African Union has already established its own Peace and Security Council  the European Union has already established a security council  and Asian countries have already established their own security council. Soon  Latin America will have its own Security Counci l as will the 120 non-aligned nations.  This means that we have already lost confidence in the United Nations Security Council  which has not provided us with security  and that is why we now are creating new regional security councils.  We are not committed to obeying the rules or the resolutions of the United Nations Security Council in its present form because it is undemocratic  dictatorial and unjust. No one can force us to join the Security Council or to obey or comply with resolutions or orders given by the Security Council in its present composition.  Furthermore  there is no respect for the United Nations and no regard for the General Assembly  which is actually the true United Nations  but whose resolutions are non-binding. The decisions of the International Court of Justice  the international judicial    09-52179 20  body  take aim only at small countries and Third World nations. Powerful countries escape the notice of the Court. Or  if judicial decisions are taken against these powerful countries  they are not enforced.  The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is an important agency within the United Nations. Powerful countries  however  are not accountable to it or under its jurisdiction. We have discovered that the IAEA is used only against us. We are told that it is an international organization  but  if that is the case  then all the countries of the world should be under its jurisdiction. If it is not truly international  then right after this speech we should no longer accept it and should close it down.  Mr. Treki  in his capacity as President of the General Assembly  should talk to the Director General of the IAEA  Mr. ElBaradei  and should ask him if he is prepared to verify nuclear energy storage in all countries and inspect all suspected increases. If he says yes  then we accept the Agency’s jurisdiction. But if he says that he cannot go into certain countries that have nuclear power and that he does not have any jurisdiction over them  then we should close the Agency down and not submit to its jurisdiction.  For your information  I called Mr. ElBaradei when we had the problem of the Libyan nuclear bomb. I called Mr. ElBaradei and asked him if the agreements by the super-Powers to reduce nuclear supplies were subject to Agency control and under inspection  and whether he was aware of any increases in their activity. He told me that he was not in a position to ask the super-Powers to be inspected.  So  is the Agency only inspecting us? If so  it does not qualify as an international organization since it is selective  just like the Security Council and the International Court of Justice. This is not equitable nor is it the United Nations. We totally reject this situation.  Regarding Africa  Mr. President  whether the United Nations is reformed or not  and even before a vote is taken on any proposals of a historic nature  Africa should be given a permanent seat on the Security Council now  having already waited too long.  Leaving aside United Nations reform  we can certainly say that Africa was colonized  isolated and persecuted and its rights usurped. Its people were enslaved and treated like animals  and its territory was colonized and placed under trusteeship. The countries of the African Union deserve a permanent seat. This is a debt from the past that has to be paid and has nothing to do with United Nations reform. It is a priority matter and is high on the agenda of the General Assembly. No one can say that the African Union does not deserve a permanent seat.  Who can argue with this proposal? I challenge anyone to make a case against it. Where is the proof that the African Union or the African continent does not deserve a permanent seat? No one can possibly deny this.  Another matter that should be voted on in the General Assembly is that of compensation for countries that were colonized  so as to prevent the colonization of a continent  the usurpation of its rights and the pillaging of its wealth from happening again.  Why are Africans going to Europe? Why are Asians going to Europe? Why are Latin Americans going to Europe? It is because Europe colonized those peoples and stole the material and human resources of Africa  Asia and Latin America — the oil  minerals  uranium  gold and diamonds  the fruit  vegetables and livestock and the people — and used them. Now  new generations of Asians  Latin Americans and Africans are seeking to reclaim that stolen wealth  as they have the right to do.  At the Libyan border  I recently stopped 1 000 African migrants headed for Europe. I asked them why they were going there. They told me it was to take back their stolen wealth — that they would not be leaving otherwise. Who can restore the wealth that was taken from us? If you decide to restore all of this wealth  there will be no more immigration from the Philippines  Latin America  Mauritius and India. Let us have the wealth that was stolen from us. Africa deserves $777 trillion in compensation from the countries that colonized it. Africans will demand that amount  and if you do not give it to them  they will go to where you have taken those trillions of dollars. They have the right to do so. They have to follow that money and to bring it back.  Why is there no Libyan immigration to Italy  even though Libya is so close by? Italy owed compensation to the Libyan people. It accepted that fact and signed an agreement with Libya  which was adopted by both the Italian and Libyan Parliaments. Italy admitted that its colonization of Libya was wrong and should never be repeated  and it promised not to   21 09-52179  attack the Libyan people by land  air or sea. Italy also agreed to provide Libya with $250 million a year in compensation over the next 20 years and to build a hospital for Libyans maimed as a result of the mines planted in Libyan territory during the Second World War. Italy apologized and promised that it would never again occupy the territory of another country. Italy  which was a kingdom during the Fascist regime and has made rich contributions to civilization  should be commended for this achievement  together with Prime Minister Berlusconi and his predecessor  who made their own contributions in that regard.  Why is the Third World demanding compensation? So that there will be no more colonization — so that large and powerful countries will not colonize  knowing that they will have to pay compensation. Colonization should be punished. The countries that harmed other peoples during the colonial era should pay compensation for the damage and suffering inflicted under their colonial rule.  There is another point that I would like to make. However  before doing so — and addressing a somewhat sensitive issue — I should like to make an aside. We Africans are happy and proud indeed that a son of Africa is now President of the United States of America. That is a historic event. Now  in a country where blacks once could not mingle with whites  in cafés or restaurants  or sit next to them on a bus  the American people have elected as their President a young black man  Mr. Obama  of Kenyan heritage. That is a wonderful thing  and we are proud. It marks the beginning of a change. However  as far as I am concerned  Obama is a temporary relief for the next four or eight years. I am afraid that we may then go back to square one. No one can guarantee how America will be governed after Obama.  We would be content if Obama could remain President of the United States of America for ever. The statement that he just made shows that he is completely different from any American President that we have seen. American Presidents used to threaten us with all manner of weapons  saying that they would send us Desert Storm  Grapes of Wrath  Rolling Thunder and poisonous roses for Libyan children. That was their approach. American Presidents used to threaten us with operations such as Rolling Thunder  sent to Viet Nam; Desert Storm  sent to Iraq; Musketeer  sent to Egypt in 1956  even though America opposed it; and the poisonous roses visited upon Libyan children by Reagan. Can you imagine? One would have thought that Presidents of a large country with a permanent seat on the Security Council and the right of veto would have protected us and sent us peace. And what did we get instead? Laser-guided bombs carried to us on F-111 aircraft. This was their approach: we will lead the world  whether you like it or not  and will punish anyone who opposes us.  What our son Obama said today is completely different. He made a serious appeal for nuclear disarmament  which we applaud. He also said that America alone could not solve the problems facing us and that the entire world should come together to do so. He said that we must do more than we are doing now  which is making speeches. We agree with that and applaud it. He said that we had come to the United Nations to talk against one another. It is true that when we come here  we should communicate with one another on an equal footing. And he said that democracy should not be imposed from outside. Until recently  American Presidents have said that democracy should be imposed on Iraq and other countries. He said that this was an internal affair. He spoke truly when he said that democracy cannot be imposed from outside.  So we have to be cautious. Before I make these sensitive remarks I note that the whole world has so many polarities. Listen: should we have a world of so many polarities? Can we not have nations on an equal footing? Let us have an answer. Does anyone have an answer as to whether it is better to have a world of so many polarities? Why can we not have equal standing? Should we have patriarchs? Should we have popes? Should we have gods?  Why should we have a world of so many polarities? We reject such a world and call for a world where big and small are equal.   The other sensitive point is the Headquarters of the United Nations. Can I have your attention  please? All of you came across the Atlantic Ocean  the Pacific Ocean  crossing the Asian continent or the African continent to reach this place. Why? Is this Jerusalem? Is this the Vatican? Is this Mecca? All of you are tired  have jet lag  have sleepless nights. You are very tired  very low  physically. Somebody just arrived now  flying 20 hours. Then we want him to make a speech and talk about this.  All of you are asleep  all of you are tired. It is clear that all of you are lacking energy because of    09-52179 22  having to make a long journey. Why do we do that? Some of our countries are in nighttime and people are asleep. Now you should be asleep  because your biological clock  your biological mind is accustomed to be asleep at this time. I wake up at 4 o’clock New York time  before dawn  because in Libya it is 11 in the morning. When I wake up at 11 o’clock it is supposed to be daytime; at 4 o’clock I am awake.  Why? Think about it. If this was decided in 1945  should we still retain it? Why can we not think about a place that is in the middle  that is comfortable?  Another important point is that America  the host country  bears the expenses and looks after the Headquarters and diplomatic missions and looks after the peace and security of the heads of State who come here. They are very strict; they spend a lot of money  New York and all of America being very tight.   I want to relieve America of this hardship. We should thank America; we say to America  thank you for all the trouble that you have taken on yourself. We say thank you to America. We want to help reassure America and New York and keep them calm. They should not have the responsibility of looking after security. Perhaps some day a terrorist could cause an explosion or bomb a president. This place is targeted by Al-Qaida  this very building. Why was it not hit on 11 September? It was beyond their power. The next target would be this place. I am not saying this in an offhand manner. We have tens of members of Al-Qaida detained in Libyan prisons. Their confessions are very scary. That makes America live under tension. One never knows what will happen. Perhaps America or this place will be targeted again by a rocket. Perhaps tens of heads of State will die. We want to relieve America from this worry. We shall take the place to where it is not targeted.  Now after 50 years United Nations Headquarters should be taken to another part of the hemisphere. After 50 years in the western hemisphere  for the next 50 years it should be in the eastern hemisphere or in the middle hemisphere  by rotation. Now  with 64 years we have an extra 14 years over the 50 that Headquarters should have been moved to somewhere else.  This is not an insult to America; it is a service to America. We should thank America. This was possible in 1945  but we should not accept it now. Of course this should be put to the vote in the General Assembly — only in the Assembly  because in section 23 of the Headquarters Agreement it says that the United Nations Headquarters can be moved to another location only by a resolution of the General Assembly. If 51 per cent of the Assembly approve relocation of Headquarters  then it can be moved.  America has the right to make security tight because it is targeted by terrorists and by Al-Qaida. America has the right to take all security measures; we are not blaming America for that. However  we do not tolerate these measures. We do not have to come to New York and be subjected to all these measures. One president told me that he was told that his co-pilot should not come to America because there are restrictions. He asked how he could cross the Atlantic without a co-pilot. Why? He does not have to come here. Another president complained that his honour guard could not come because there was some misunderstanding regarding his name when it came to granting a visa. Another president said his own doctor could not get a visa and could not come to America.  The security measures are very strict. If a country has any problem with America  they will set up restrictions on the movements of member delegations  as if one is in Guantanamo. Is this a Member State of the United Nations  or is it a prisoner in the Guantanamo camp that cannot be allowed free movement?  This is what is submitted to the General Assembly for a vote — moving the Headquarters. If 51 per cent agree  then we come to the second vote: to the middle of the globe  or to the eastern part. If we say that we must move the Headquarters to the middle of the hemisphere  why do we not move to Sirte or Vienna? One can come even without a visa. Once you come as a president  Libya is a secure country. We are not going to restrict you to 100 or 500 metres. Libya has no hostile actions against anybody. I think the same holds true of Vienna.  If the vote says we should move Headquarters to the eastern part  then it will be Delhi or Beijing  the capital of China or the capital of India.  That is logical  my brothers. I do not think there will be any objection to that. Then you will thank me for this proposal  for eliminating the suffering and the trouble of flying 14  15 or 20 hours to come here. No one can blame America or say that America will reduce its contributions to the United Nations. No one should   23 09-52179  have that bad thought. America  I am sure  is committed to its international obligations. America will not be angry; it will thank you for alleviating its hardship  for taking on all that hardship and all the restrictions  even though this place is targeted by terrorists.   We come now to the issues that will be considered by the General Assembly. We are about to put the United Nations on trial; the old organization will be finished and a new one will emerge. This is not a normal gathering. Even son Obama said that this is not a normal gathering. It is a historic meeting.  The wars that took place after the establishment of the United Nations — why did they occur? Where was the Security Council  where was the Charter  where was the United Nations? There should be investigations and judicial intervention. Why have there been massacres? We can start with the Korean War because it took place after the establishment of the United Nations. How did a war break out and cause millions of victims? Nuclear weapons could have been used in that war. Those who are responsible for causing the war should be tried and should pay compensation and damages.  Then we come to the Suez Canal war of 1956. That file should be opened wide. Three countries with permanent seats on the Security Council and with the right of veto in the Council attacked a member State of this General Assembly. A country that was a sovereign State — Egypt — was attacked  its army was destroyed  thousands of Egyptians were killed and many Egyptian towns and entities were destroyed  all because Egypt wanted to nationalize the Suez Canal. How could such a thing have happened during the era of the United Nations and its Charter? How is it possible to guarantee that such a thing will not be repeated unless we make amends for past wrongs? Those were dangerous events and the Suez Canal and Korean war files should be re-opened.  Next we come to the Viet Nam war. There were 3 million victims of that war. During 12 days  more bombs were dropped than during four years of the Second World War. It was a fiercer war  and it took place after the establishment of the United Nations and after we had decided that there would be no more wars.  The future of humankind is at stake. We cannot stay silent. How can we feel safe? How can we be complacent? This is the future of the world  and we who are in the General Assembly of the United Nations must make sure that such wars are not repeated in the future.  Then Panama was attacked  even though it was an independent member State of the General Assembly. Four thousand people were killed  and the President of that country was taken prisoner and put in prison. Noriega should be released — we should open that file. How can we entitle a country that is a United Nations Member State to wage war against another country and capture its president  treat him as a criminal and put him in prison? Who would accept that? It could be repeated. We should not stay quiet. We should have an investigation. Any one of us Member States could face the same situation  especially if such aggression is by a Member State with a permanent seat on the Security Council and with the responsibility to maintain peace and security worldwide.  Then there was the war in Grenada. That country was invaded even though it was a Member State. It was attacked by 5 000 war ships  7 000 troops and dozens of military aircraft  and it is the smallest country in the world. This occurred after the establishment of the United Nations and of the Security Council and its veto. And the President of Grenada  Mr. Maurice Bishop  was assassinated. How could that have happened with impunity? It is a tragedy. How can we guarantee that the United Nations is good or not  that a certain country is good or not? Can we be safe or happy about our future or not? Can we trust the Security Council or not? Can we trust the United Nations or not?  We must look into and investigate the bombing of Somalia. Somalia is a United Nations Member State. It is an independent country under the rule of Aidid. We want an investigation. Why did that happen? Who allowed it to happen? Who gave the green light for that country to be attacked?  Then there is the former Yugoslavia. No country was as peaceful as Yugoslavia  constructed step by step and piece by piece after being destroyed by Hitler. We destroyed it  as if we were doing the same job as Hitler. Tito built that peaceful country step by step and brick by brick and then we arrived and broke it apart for imperialistic  personal interests. How can we be complacent about that? Why can we not be satisfied? If a peaceful country like Yugoslavia faced such a tragedy  the General Assembly should have an    09-52179 24  investigation and should decide who should be tried before the International Criminal Court.  Then we have the war in Iraq — the mother of all evils. The United Nations should also investigate that. The General Assembly  presided over by Mr. Treki  should investigate that. The invasion of Iraq was a violation of the United Nations Charter. It was done without any justification by super-Powers with permanent seats on the Security Council. Iraq is an independent country and a member State of the General Assembly. How could those countries attack Iraq? As provided for in the Charter  the United Nations should have intervened and stopped the attack.  We spoke in the General Assembly and urged it to use the Charter to stop that attack. We were against the invasion of Kuwait  and the Arab countries fought Iraq alongside foreign countries in the name of the United Nations Charter.  In the first instance  the Charter was respected  The second time when we wanted to use the Charter to stop the war against Iraq  no one used it and that document was ignored. Why did that occur? Mr. Treki and the General Assembly should investigate to determine whether there was any reason at all to invade Iraq. Because the reasons for that attack remain mysterious and ambiguous  and we might face the same destiny.  Why was Iraq invaded? The invasion itself was a serious violation of the United Nations Charter  and it was wrong. There was also a total massacre or genocide. More than 1.5 million Iraqis were killed. We want to bring the Iraqi file before the International Criminal Court (ICC)  and we want those who committed mass murder against the Iraqi people to be tried.  It is easy for Charles Taylor to be tried  or for Bashir to be tried  or for Noriega to be tried. That is an easy job. Yes  but what about those who have committed mass murder against the Iraqis? They cannot be tried? They cannot go before the ICC? If the Court is unable to accommodate us  then we should not accept it. Either it is meant for all of us  large or small  or we should not accept it and should reject it.  Anyone who commits a war crime can be tried  but we are not livestock or animals like those that are slaughtered for the Eid. We have the right to live  and we are ready to fight and to defend ourselves. We have the right to live in dignity  under the sun and on earth; they have already tested us and we have withstood the test.  There are other things as well. Why is it that Iraqi prisoners of war can be sentenced to death? When Iraq was invaded and the President of Iraq was taken he was a prisoner of war. He should not have been tried; he should not have been hanged. When the war was over  he should have been released. We want to know why a prisoner of war should have been tried. Who sentenced the President of Iraq to death? Is there an answer to that question? We know the identity of the judge who tried him. As to who tied the noose around the President’s neck on the day of sacrifice and hanged him  those people wore masks.  How could this have happened in a civilized world? These were prisoners of war of civilized countries under international law. How could Government ministers and a head of State be sentenced to death and hanged? Were those who tried them lawyers or members of a judicial system?  Do you know what people are saying? They are saying that the faces behind the masks were those of the President of the United States and the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and that it was they who put the President of Iraq to death.  Why do the executioners not unmask their faces? Why do we not know their ranks? Why do we not know whether they were officers  judges  soldiers or doctors? How does it come about that the President of a State Member of the United Nations was sentenced to death and killed? We do not know the identity of the executioners. The United Nations is duty-bound to answer these questions: who carried out the death sentence? They must have legal status and official responsibilities; we should know their identities and we should know about the presence of a physician and the nature of all the legal proceedings. That would be true for an ordinary citizen  let alone for the President of a State Member of the United Nations who was put to death in that manner.  My third point on the Iraq war relates to Abu Ghraib. This was a disgrace to humankind. I know that the United States authorities will investigate this scandal  but the United Nations must not ignore it either. The General Assembly should investigate this matter. Prisoners of war held in Abu Ghraib prison were torturers; dogs were set on them; men were raped.   25 09-52179  This is unprecedented in the history of war. It was sodomy  and it was an unprecedented sin  never before committed by past aggressors or invaders. Prisoners of war are soldiers  but these were raped in prison by a State  a permanent member of the Security Council. This goes against civilization and humankind. We must not keep silent; we must know the facts. Even today  a quarter of a million Iraqi prisoners  men and women alike  remain in Abu Ghraib. They are being maltreated  persecuted and raped. There must be an investigation.  Turning to the war in Afghanistan  this too must be investigated. Why are we against the Taliban? Why are we against Afghanistan? Who are the Taliban? If the Taliban want a religious State  that is fine. Think of the Vatican. Does the Vatican pose a threat to us? No. It is a religious  very peaceful State. If the Taliban want to create an Islamic Amirate  who says that this makes them an enemy? Is anyone claiming that Bin Laden is of the Taliban or that he is Afghan? Is Bin Laden of the Taliban? No; he is not of the Taliban and he is not Afghan. Were the terrorists who hit New York City of the Taliban? Were they from Afghanistan? They were neither Taliban nor Afghan. Then  what was the reason for the wars in Iraq and in Afghanistan?  If I truly wanted to deceive my American and British friends  I would encourage them to send more troops and I would encourage them to persist in this bloodbath. But they will never succeed in Iraq or Afghanistan. Look what happened to them in Iraq  which is a desert. It is even worse in mountainous Afghanistan. If I wanted to deceive them I would tell them to continue the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. But no  I want to save the citizens of the United States  the United Kingdom and other countries who are fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. So I tell them: leave Afghanistan to the Afghans; leave Iraq to the Iraqis. If they want to fight each other  they are free to do so.  America had its Civil War  and no one interfered in it. There were civil wars in Spain  China and countries all over the world — no place on Earth has been free of civil wars. Let there be a civil war in Iraq. If the Iraqis want to have a civil war and fight each other  that is fine. Who says that if the Taliban form a Government they would possess intercontinental missiles or the kind of aeroplanes that hit New York? Did those aeroplanes take off from Afghanistan or Iraq? No; they took off from American airports. So why is Afghanistan being struck? The terrorists were not Afghans or Taliban or Iraqis.  Why are we silent? We must never be war devils: anyone who does not speak the truth is a silent devil. We are committed to international peace and security. We do not wish to scorn or ridicule humankind. We want to save humanity.  As President of the General Assembly  Mr. Ali Treki should open an investigation of the assassinations file — in addition to the war files. Who killed Patrice Lumumba  and why? We merely want to record it in the annals of African history; we want to know how an African leader  a liberator  came to be assassinated. Who killed him? We want our sons to be able to read the history of how Patrice Lumumba  the hero of Congo’s liberation struggle  was assassinated. We want to know the facts  even 50 years on. That is one file that should be reopened.  And who killed Secretary-General Hammarskjöld? Who fired on his aeroplane in 1961  and why?  Then  there is the assassination of United States President Kennedy in 1963. We want to know who killed him and why. There was somebody called Lee Harvey Oswald  who was then killed by one Jack Ruby. Why did he kill him? Jack Ruby  an Israeli  killed Lee Harvey Oswald  who killed Kennedy. Why did this Israeli kill Kennedy’s killer? Then Jack Ruby  the killer of the killer of Kennedy  died in mysterious circumstances before he could be tried. We must open the files. The whole world knows that Kennedy wanted to investigate the Israeli Dimona nuclear reactor. This involves international peace and security and weapons of mass destrucion. That is why we should open this file.  Then there is the assassination of Martin Luther King  the black reverend and human rights activist. His assassination was a plot  and we should know why he was killed and who killed him.  Then Khalil Wazir  or Abu Jihad  a Palestinian  was attacked. He was living peacefully in Tunisia  a Member State  and that country’s sovereignty was not respected. We cannot keep silent. Even though submarines and ships were detected along the coast of Tunisia  where he was killed  no one was accused or tried. Abu Iyad was also killed  and we should know how he was killed. He was killed in ambiguous circumstances. In Operation Spring of Youth  Kamal    09-52179 26  Nasser  a poet  Kamal Adwan and Abu Youssef al-Najjar  three Palestinians  were killed in Lebanon  a country that is a free  sovereign State member of the General Assembly. They were attacked and killed while sleeping peacefully. We should know who killed them  and he should be tried so that those crimes against humanity are not repeated.  We have already talked about the size of the force used in the invasion of Grenada — 7 000 troops  15 battleships and dozens of bombers — and President Bishop was killed even though Grenada was a Member State. Those are crimes  and we cannot keep silent. Otherwise  we will look like sacrificial beasts. We are not animals. Year after year  we are attacked. We defend ourselves  our sons and our children  and we are not afraid. We have the right to live  and the Earth is not destined for violence  but for us all. We can never live on this Earth in such humiliation. So those are the wars.  The last file is that of the massacres. In the Sabra and Shatila massacre  3 000 people were killed. That area  under the protection of the occupying Israeli army  was the site of a huge and calamitous massacre in which 3 000 Palestinian men  women and children were killed. How can we keep quiet? Lebanon is a sovereign State; a member of the General Assembly was occupied  Sabra and Shatila were under Israeli control  and then the massacre took place.  Then there was the 2008 massacre in Gaza. There were 1 000 women and 2 200 children among the victims killed in the massacre in Gaza in 2008. Sixty United Nations facilities and another 30 belonging to non-governmental organizations were damaged. Fifty clinics were destroyed. Forty doctors and nurses were killed while carrying out humanitarian activities. This took place in Gaza in December 2008.  The perpetrators are still alive  and they should be tried by the International Criminal Court (ICC). Should we try only the underdogs  the weak and the poor of third-world countries  and not important and protected figures? Under international law  they should all face trial for the consequences of the crimes that they have committed. Otherwise  the role of the ICC will never be recognized. If the decisions of the ICC are not respected or implemented  if the General Assembly and the Security Council mean nothing  and if the International Atomic Energy Agency serves only certain countries and organizations  then what is the United Nations? It would mean that the United Nations is nothing and is insignificant. Where is it? There is no United Nations.  Then  while piracy may be a phenomenon of the high seas  a form of terrorism  we talk about the piracy in Somalia. Somalis are not pirates. We are the pirates. We went there and usurped their economic zones  their fish and their wealth. Libya  India  Japan and America — any country in the world — we are all pirates. We all entered the territorial waters and economic zones of Somalia and stole. The Somalis are protecting their own fish  their sustenance. They have become pirates because they are defending their children’s food. Now  we seek to address that matter in the wrong way. Should we send warships to Somalia? We should send warships to the pirates who have attacked and seized the economic zones and wealth of the Somalis and the food of their children.  I met the pirates  and I told them that I would negotiate an agreement between them and the international community that respects the 200-mile exclusive economic zone under the law of the sea  that protects all marine resources belonging to the Somali people  and that stops all countries from disposing of toxic waste along the Somali coast. In return  the Somalis would no longer attack ships. We will propose and draft such an international treaty and submit it to the General Assembly. That is the solution. The solution does not lie in sending more military ships to fight the Somalis. That is not the solution.   We are addressing the phenomena of piracy and terrorism in the wrong way. Today there is swine flu. Perhaps tomorrow there will be fish flu  because sometimes we produce viruses by controlling them. It is a commercial business. Capitalist companies produce viruses so that they can generate and sell vaccinations. That is very shameful and poor ethics. Vaccinations and medicine should not be sold. In The Green Book  I maintain that medicines should not be sold or subject to commercialization. Medicines should be free of charge and vaccinations given free to children  but capitalist companies produce the viruses and vaccinations and want to make a profit. Why are they not free of charge? We should give them free of charge  and not sell them. The entire world should strive to protect our people  create and manufacture vaccinations and give them free to children and women  and not profit by them. All those items are on   27 09-52179  the agenda of the General Assembly  which has only to exercise that duty.  The Ottawa Convention on Landmines forbids the production of landmines. That is wrong. Landmines are defensive weapons. If I place them along the border of my country and someone wants to invade me  they may be killed. That is all right  because they are invading me. The Convention should be reconsidered. I am not taking that defensive weapon to another country. The enemy is coming to me. On the Al-Qadhafi website  I call for that treaty to be modified or annulled. This treaty should be modified or annulled. I want to use anti-personnel mines to defend my home against invasion. Eliminate weapons of mass destruction  not landmines  which are defensive weapons.  With regard to the Palestinian situation  the two-State solution is impossible; it is not practical. Currently  these two States completely overlap. Partition is doomed to failure. These two States are not neighbours; they are coextensive  in terms of both population and geography. A buffer zone cannot be created between the two States because there are half a million Israeli settlers in the West Bank and a million Arab Palestinians in the territory known as Israel.  The solution is therefore a democratic State without religious fanaticism or ethnicity. The generation of Sharon and Arafat is over. We need a new generation  in which everyone can live in peace. Look at Palestinian and Israeli youth; they both want peace and democracy  and they want to live under one State. This conflict poisons the world.  The White Book actually has the solution; I hold it here. The solution is Isratine. Arabs have no hostility or animosity towards Israel. We are cousins and of the same race. We want to live in peace. The refugees should go back.  You are the ones who brought the Holocaust upon the Jews. You  not we  are the ones who burned them. We gave them refuge. We gave them safe haven during the Roman era and the Arab reign in Andalusia and during the rule of Hitler. You are the ones who poisoned them; you are the ones who annihilated them. We provided them with protection. You expelled them. Let us see the truth. We are not hostile; we are not enemies of the Jews. And one day the Jews will need the Arabs. At that point  Arabs will be the ones to give them protection  to save them  as we have done in the past. Look at what everybody else did to the Jews. Hitler is an example. You are the ones who hate the Jews  not us.  In brief  Kashmir should be an independent State  neither Indian nor Pakistani. We must end that conflict. Kashmir should be a buffer State between India and Pakistan.  With regard to Darfur  I truly hope that the assistance provided by international organizations can be used for development projects  for agriculture  for industry and for irrigation. You are the ones who made it a crisis; you put it on the altar; you wanted to sacrifice Darfur so that you could interfere in its internal affairs.  You have turned the Hariri problem into a United Nations problem. You are selling Hariri’s corpse. You just want to settle scores with Syria. Lebanon is an independent State; it has laws  courts  a judiciary and police. At this stage  it is no longer the perpetrators that are being sought; the real wish is to settle scores with Syria  not ensure justice for Hariri. The cases of Khalil al-Wazir  Lumumba  Kennedy  and Hammarskjöld should also have been turned over to the United Nations  if the Hariri case merits such attention.  The General Assembly is now under the presidency of Libya. This is our right. Libya hopes that you will assist in making the transition from a world fraught with crises and tension to a world in which humanity  peace and tolerance prevail. I will personally follow up on this issue with the General Assembly  President Treki and the Secretary-General. It is not our habit to compromise when it comes to the destiny of humanity and the struggles of the third world and the 100 small nations  which should live in peace always."
"100",4107,"LCA",64,2009,"I wish to express the warm congratulations of the delegation of Saint Lucia to Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki on his election to serve as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. With his vast diplomatic experience  we are most confident that this session will yield significant results in advancing the agenda of the international community through this most universal of institutions  the General Assembly  which has been rightly described by his predecessor  Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann  as the “Group of 192”. We express our appreciation for the work of Mr. D’Escoto Brockmann  who succeeded in further elevating the Assembly so that it could regain its rightful place as the parliament of the world. We pledge to work with Mr. Treki in the furtherance of that approach. We also thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his tireless efforts on behalf of us all.  When developing countries agreed to the ambitious but necessary Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the internationally agreed development goals  few  if any  foresaw that the winds would be contrary  the storms fierce and the course ahead so challenging. We are more than halfway to the 2015 deadline for achieving the Millennium Development Goals  and Governments in the developing world are still struggling to meet their objectives. That situation  of course  is the result of developing countries facing unforeseen economic hardship as a result of crisis after crisis that for the most part are not of our own making. While the developed world appears to be in the infant stages of recovery  the developing countries are still in the wake of this crisis and are struggling to find calmer waters.  In that connection  it is important that the Doha Round of trade negotiations be reshaped as a development round  with emphasis on substantially reducing the tariff and non-tariff barriers that have been imposed by developed countries  especially regarding agricultural products.  The matter of substantive debt relief to permit the developing countries to utilize their limited resources for national development must also be given the most serious consideration. The MDGs are still achievable  but the developed countries must meet their agreed commitments if those objectives are to be attained in a manner consistent with the global timetable.  While all of the MDGs are relevant to the development aspirations of the people of my country and of the region  we believe that education  poverty alleviation and the strengthening of institutions for good governance are pivotal to this process. These must form the bedrock for overall development. So  despite sluggish advancement towards the achievement of all the Goals  we have made significant progress in the areas of poverty and hunger  universal education and gender equality. My own country boasts gender parity in wage employment in the non-agricultural sector  a long-standing problem in our region.   Despite such progress  continued improvement is required in the other priority areas of reducing child mortality and promoting maternal health. Unfortunately  as I speak here  my Government is grappling with the loss of a hospital on the southern part of the island that burned down two weeks ago  with loss of life. We have launched an appeal for assistance and hope that those most able to do so will help generously.  We in Saint Lucia are observing the current global state of affairs through bifocal lenses; we see both challenges and opportunity — an opportunity to take bold new steps and think outside the box in tackling the issues that confront us. The right mix of appropriate policy interventions  strong political will and strategic partnerships supported by development stakeholders is certain to help countries such as Saint Lucia achieve the Millennium Development Goals in a timely manner. Therefore  hope is not completely lost.   Higher prices for food  fuel and other essentials forced most Governments of developing countries to divert already scarce resources in order to subsidize those commodities for the poorest in our societies. That then put pressure on their ability to repay debts and  together with mismanagement within the world financial sector  triggered a global financial and economic crisis.  The world conference held here at United Nations Headquarters last June to assess the worst global economic downturn since the Great Depression succeeded in identifying immediate and long-term measures to mitigate the impact of the crisis  especially on developing countries  and to begin the necessary    09-52604 24  international deliberations on the restructuring of the international financial architecture. Saint Lucia and the rest of the Caribbean Community welcomed the initiative  and we participated fully in the deliberations.   Saint Lucia therefore supports the measures called for in the outcome document (resolution 63/303  annex) to sustain the initiative while also providing the machinery necessary for the continued monitoring of the world economy. To that end  we emphasize the importance of strengthening the capacity  effectiveness and efficiency of the United Nations and of making the international financial institutions more compassionate in their responses and their assistance to national development strategies. We look forward to analysing the report of the ad hoc open-ended working group of the Assembly on the implementation of the mandate  as well as the reports of the Secretary-General on the global food security crisis  the International Labour Organization report on the Global Jobs Pact and the contributions of the Inter-Parliamentary Union to the new development financing agenda.   The most pressing issue and challenge facing Saint Lucia  and indeed the rest of the world  is climate change. It has emerged as the most serious developmental challenge facing mankind today — hence  the demands for collective action and an urgent response. We are extremely concerned that the adverse effects of climate change are constantly altering access to basic resources such as land  water and food. Decreased accessibility threatens social security  a daily reality for many of us around the world. We may not disappear  as the Maldives will  if nothing is done  but it will certainly be expensive to survive.  On 21 September 2009  heads of member States of the Alliance of Small Island Developing States (AOSIS) adopted a declaration on climate change that spelled out some of the pressing issues that need to be addressed by all States. Before that we had the 1994 Barbados Programme of Action; the final communiqué of the 1999 AOSIS Heads of Government Meeting; the outcome document of the General Assembly’s special session held in 1999 to review and assess the Barbados Programme (resolution S-22/2)  and the adoption in 2005 of the Mauritius Strategy for Further Implementation. All represented extensive legislative authority for concerted international action and clearly set forth the position of the most vulnerable States.   That extensive mandate provides the framework for a strategy to arrest the impact of climate change that can lead to the emergence of a sustainable world for present and future generations. The 2007 high-level event on climate change  held to discuss “The future in our hands: addressing the leadership challenge of climate change”  was also instructive in reinforcing the mandates of earlier sessions. Alas  it seems the rest of the world has not seen the urgency for action.  For our part  Saint Lucia and other Caribbean States have pledged to take voluntary mitigation measures to ensure our collective survival. We are working assiduously to formulate policies and review legislation to develop our renewable energy potential in wind  solar and geothermal power. We will intensify efforts to preserve our limited forest cover  which serves to protect our water supply and biodiversity and is an important factor in carbon sequestration. For us these are critical survival measures.  Saint Lucia has joined with other CARICOM member States to establish early-warning systems for predicting disasters such as floods and hurricanes. CARICOM heads of Government have also adopted the Liliendaal Declaration on Climate Change and Development  which expressed the commitment to protect the region’s marine resources and ecosystems and work towards fulfilling the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change objectives.  While these sustainable development practices have long-term benefits  the financial investment required to support them is very onerous for small island developing States. We have indicated that our Governments have been proactive; however  the small island developing States still need financial support to enhance their capacity to respond to challenges brought on by climate change. Let me reiterate that these problems are not of our doing. Lack of access to cost-effective  affordable and environmentally sound technologies significantly threatens to stall or reverse progress already made. Nor will mitigation be enough if not supported by adaptation measures. We therefore urge States to fulfil their commitment to the Adaptation Fund  which will help us cope with changes that have made life difficult for many peoples.  We the small island developing States and least developed countries have joined together to demand  appeal and even beg  if necessary  that the new Copenhagen climate agreement limit temperature   25 09-52604  increases to the attainable level of 1.5 degrees Celsius  as it is possible that anything above that will be devastating to our very existence. We urge other inhabitants of planet Earth to be understanding and cooperative as we work to seal the deal in Copenhagen. If we cannot reverse or slow the effects of climate change  all other activities  as noble as they may be  will be useless to mankind.  Our efforts to advance our own development progress are sometimes derailed because of a lack of resources and a peculiar grouping that excludes many States from access to certain types of aid  loans and/or development assistance currently available only to least developed States — ironically  because of our success in managing our affairs. It would appear that we are being punished for being prudent in the management of our limited resources.  Middle-income countries like Saint Lucia continue to face significant challenges in reducing poverty  servicing debt and achieving the Millennium Development Goals. My Government is pleased to note that the United Nations and the international financial institutions have recognized that there is a need to address the development needs of middle-income countries and to reinforce global support for their development efforts. We are cognizant that this group of countries is not homogeneous and that individual economic and social circumstances must be taken into account. However  as a group  we deserve greater attention from the donor community and the United Nations system. We hope our pleas do not fall on deaf ears  and that assistance will not come too late.  While we bemoan the slow pace of assistance from the North  we appreciate the efforts of our traditional friends — the United Kingdom  the United States  Canada  France  the European Union  Japan  to name a few — to meet their official development assistance targets and agreed commitments. However  the significance of cooperation among developing countries cannot be overlooked. South-South cooperation has become an effective tool for economic development and foreign policy and constitutes one of the most important dimensions of international cooperation for development  particularly in the context of globalization and liberalization. South-South cooperation is also an imperative to complement North-South cooperation and strengthen the institutional capacities of the countries of the South to engage in sustainable development practices. An ever-changing global landscape has impelled developing countries to take initiatives to safeguard one another’s common interests  since they possess diverse assets that can nonetheless be complementary.  That has been our goal within CARICOM  and we thank the Government of Trinidad and Tobago for so often leading the way on such matters. The Government of Saint Lucia also wishes to express its gratitude for the assistance provided by the Republic of Cuba  whose international medical assistance programme has served the people of the region  the wider hemisphere and beyond. And we express our appreciation for the support we have received from other countries in our region  including the Latin American States of Brazil  Mexico and Venezuela  to name a few.  The historic cultural ties between Africa and the Caribbean are well known  and cooperation between our two regions is being strengthened through recent developments such as the African Union Diaspora Initiative and the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States Secretariat. We in Saint Lucia have received support from the Kuwaiti funds to assist in infrastructure development. In short  we are reaching out to the world for cooperation and collaboration in the advancement of our development efforts  within the framework of respect for each other and for humankind.  That is why the Government of Saint Lucia joins with other delegations in extending our deep condolences to the Government and people of Taiwan following the devastation and loss of life caused by the disastrous Typhoon Morakot in August. Taiwan has assisted Saint Lucia in the areas of education  agriculture  health and other fields critical to our development efforts. Their assistance in agriculture  especially  has enabled us to improve our output and position ourselves for breaking into the food export market. Taiwan has extended a helping hand to all those who have requested it. It seeks only to be part of the family of nations and to share its knowledge and expertise with the rest of the world. That is not too much to ask. We are pleased to note that some positive steps have been taken in this respect  and we hope they will continue  with other agencies opening their doors to participation and thus to enable 23 million people to make their contribution to their fellow human beings and to realize their aspirations  as we in Saint Lucia did 30 years ago.    09-52604 26   We also extend our sympathies to the Government and people of the Philippines for the loss of life and destruction caused by Typhoon Ketsana three days ago.  Saint Lucia joins with other CARICOM countries in expressing profound concern and deep disappointment with the decision by the Administering Power to dissolve the Government and legislature in the non-self-governing territory of the Turks and Caicos Islands  an associate member of CARICOM. We call for a speedy return to democratic governance  without which the territory’s participation in the regional integration process will be in jeopardy.  Economic diversification for small States is critical to their ability to remain competitive in an ever more globalized economy  and many small States have developed vibrant financial service industries that have evolved as clean  competitive industries in a world economy increasingly dependent on services. Clearly  the competitiveness of tax rates and international tax compensation are fundamental tools of globalization and represent one of the few areas where small States have been able to enter this new economy from a competitive position. To this end Saint Lucia joined with other CARICOM States last July in adopting the Liliendaal Declaration on the Financial Sector: A New Framework for Financial Regulation and Supervision in the Region.  It is important to note that the regional policy contains provisions for continued improvement in standards for disclosure  transparency and corporate governance for both public and private companies. However  despite our best efforts  international financial centres in the Caribbean and elsewhere have recently been under intense pressure from high-tax nations. Saint Lucia joins our regional partners in continuing to enhance transparency by the strengthening of regulatory frameworks. We stand with our CARICOM colleagues in calling for equitable treatment in accord with that granted to the developed countries and other preferential jurisdictions.  It matters little if we are rich if we are insecure in our homes and our country. And that is why in recent years the issue of small arms and light weapons has emerged as a major source of concern to us. Small developing States like Saint Lucia continue to be threatened by the disturbing spread of small arms. The illicit introduction of those weapons into our societies has created a heavy burden in our region  which has seen the emergence of an unacceptable level of gun violence  worsened by the social distress caused by the economic and financial crisis. Saint Lucia reiterates its support for the implementation of relevant General Assembly resolutions addressing the illicit trade of small arms and light weapons in all its aspects  most recently resolution 63/72 of 2 December 2008. Saint Lucia wishes also to express its continued support for the full implementation of the international instruments to enable States to identify and trace illicit small arms and light weapons in a timely and reliable manner.   On top of all our financial problems it seems we are asked to bear an unfair burden in relation to world peace and security. While ensuring an effective funding mechanism is the collective responsibility of the membership  we concur that the future scale of assessment should be constant  simple and transparent. We fully support the view of the Committee on Contributions that the scale should be based on gross national income data  as that is the most accurate reflection of one’s capacity to pay.  In the face of all the challenges outlined above and in this present state of world affairs  it is no longer pragmatic to utilize attenuated financial and technical assistance schemes designed many years ago. They have given way to development challenges that are often of astronomical size as well as nebulous  necessitating long-term  cumulative responses. In short  the world is in crisis-management mode  and that is seriously affecting the ability of developing countries to move forward and onward to progress.  However  crisis management must be undertaken with sustainable development in mind and integrated into the policymaking processes by both donor and recipient countries. Coordination and collaboration  therefore  are essential within and among Governments  organizations and local communities if a sustainable and forward-looking approach is to be achieved.  We chose as our theme for this session of the Assembly “Effective responses to global crises: strengthening multilateralism and dialogue among civilizations for international peace  security and development”. I hope that this body  made up of a diverse group of countries  will work together towards achieving the goals to which we all aspire.   27 09-52604   Like Jason in his good ship the Argo  fair Helen — Saint Lucia — will brave the seas  chart a new course and take our people to the heights of development and dignity that befit a country that has produced two Nobel Laureates."
"101",4134,"LIE",64,2009,"It is a great honour for me to address the General Assembly  a body that represents the heart of multilateral diplomacy  for the first time tonight. As such  it is called to fulfil the expectations and hopes of peoples and individuals around the world — hopes for peace  hopes for an end to poverty and suffering and hopes to see human rights respected.  Since my arrival in New York a couple of days ago  I have been encouraged by the multiple calls for international cooperation and the renewed commitment to multilateralism. For Liechtenstein  the United Nations has always been the epitome of multilateralism. We believe that genuine multilateralism is needed today in order to address the challenges before us.  On disarmament and non-proliferation  we seem to be finally about to enter a new era.  On climate change  the United Nations is working hard to seal the deal. Last Tuesday  an unprecedented number of heads of State or Government gathered in this Hall to discuss climate change threats. We applaud Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for this excellent initiative. The Liechtenstein delegation left that meeting with the belief that a breakthrough is possible because everybody seems to understand the gravity of the situation. We are approaching Copenhagen with the firm conviction that we must listen to the voices of those who are most at risk — those whose very survival is at stake. What is now required from us is a leap of faith — no half-hearted compromises  no more postponing  and no more talk about concessions either. Copenhagen is not about giving up something — other than our self-destructive habits. It is about investing into the future of our planet.  The global financial and economic crisis has rippled through our countries and disrupted the lives of people worldwide. It has also deeply affected our progress towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. While much attention has been paid and much money has been mobilized to keep the world economy afloat  another crisis has emerged in its wake. It is a crisis of global governance  and it may have lasting repercussions.  We acknowledge that there are times when concerted action by groups such as the Group of Eight and the Group of 20 (G-20) can bring us closer to solutions for everyone. But we cannot ignore the gap between those who are taking decisions and the rest of us. Good and effective solutions require the support of those who are to implement them. Most important  rules must apply to everyone equally  on the basis of a level playing field.  The notion of sovereign equality is one of the core principles of the United Nations Charter. Indeed  it is the main pillar of genuine multilateralism. I was therefore pleased to accept an invitation from the Foreign Minister of Singapore to discuss issues of global governance together with some other colleagues and friends. I look forward to continuing those exchanges and I hope that the G-20 and other partners will find interest in our input and ideas. Our goal is positive engagement  productive cooperation and the highest possible quality in decision-making.  The drafters of the United Nations Charter understood that the inclusion of all States was a prerequisite for effective multilateralism. In today’s interconnected world  we must uphold this principle more than ever. But the practice of the Organization has sometimes veered away from the ideals of inclusion  transparency and legitimacy.  On international peace and security  the Security Council is mandated to carry out its functions on behalf of all of us. Our understanding is therefore that the Council’s legitimacy depends on the extent to which its actions reflect a very wide political consensus. Often    45 09-52592  though  the Council shows little interest in including in its decision-making process those who are instrumental for implementation. Together with the other members of the Small Five Group  we will continue to work for inclusion and transparency in the Council’s work. We will also look for further improvements in the Council’s sanctions procedures. As numerous judicial challenges have shown  those procedures must be brought closer to international standards of human rights and due process. Such improvements would go a long way in improving the effectiveness  perception and legitimacy of sanctions.  The composition of the Security Council is outdated. This is sadly almost the only agreement we have found after many years of controversial discussions on its enlargement. Our position on the matter is clear. None of the proposals submitted at the 2005 World Summit  or variations thereof  will receive the necessary support in the Assembly  let alone in the ratification process. We see only two avenues towards expansion. We can wait for a massive institutional crisis to hit the Organization and then expand the Council under enormous public pressure  or we can work in a cooperative manner towards a solution that is both a compromise and politically sustainable. We believe that only the latter approach is in the best interest of the Organization. As a result of the last session  there are now clear ideas on the table on how to bridge the gap. They deserve a thorough review during the coming months.  Over the past two decades  multilateralism has perhaps been most successful in the area of international criminal justice. The first generation of international tribunals has had a tremendous impact  and is now approaching the conclusion of its work. Most important  we have created the International Criminal Court — an institution that seemed a distant dream not too long ago. During its first years in operation  the Court has been remarkably successful. It has also been subject to controversial political discussions. This is not surprising  because justice can be difficult and can seem inconvenient. That is particularly true in situations of ongoing conflict. But it is not a choice. To quote Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon  the debate is no longer between peace and justice but between peace and what kind of justice. Indeed  peace  development and justice go hand in hand. These tasks must be fulfilled  first and foremost  by States themselves. We must therefore galvanize efforts to strengthen national judiciaries  in accordance with the principle of complementarity.  The International Criminal Court will not be able to put on trial all perpetrators of the most serious crimes. But its work illustrates the world’s consensus that there must be accountability for these crimes and that impunity is no longer an option. The 2010 review conference will give us the opportunity to add the crime of aggression to the list of crimes under the active jurisdiction of the Court. We hope that we will find it in ourselves to seize this historic event.  The General Assembly remains the heart of genuine multilateral work. We must trust that the President will lead the Assembly in a manner that reflects the priorities of the membership as a whole. Important negotiations are ahead of us. We will prepare the 2010 summit on the Millennium Development Goals  continue discussions on the arms trade treaty  move ahead with various reform processes  negotiate both a new budget and a new scale of assessments  address human rights both in specific situations and thematically  keep working on the promotion of the rule of law at all levels  work to strengthen the framework for development and humanitarian assistance  and much more.   Looking at the work programme ahead  it seems to us that the General Assembly does not need much revitalization. There are numerous concrete challenges in front of us  to which we Member States must rise. We must look beyond our short-term domestic interests and work hard to make progress on our comprehensive agenda. The renewed expressions of commitment that we have witnessed in this Hall over the past days give us confidence. The Assembly will do its best to live up to the world’s expectations and  more than ever  strive in unison. "
"102",4181,"LKA",64,2009,"I take great pleasure in congratulating Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. Sri Lanka extends its fullest cooperation to him so that we can effectively conclude the work before us.  Significant developments have taken place in Sri Lanka since my President  Mahinda Rajapaksa  addressed the sixty-third session of the General Assembly last year (see A/63/PV.7). This year I take the floor with renewed hope and optimism for my country.  In May 2009  Sri Lanka was successful in defeating the scourge of brutal terrorism after almost three decades of conflict inflicted on us by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)  one of the most ruthless terrorist organizations known to the international community. Our recent anti-terrorist operations cost us only $2.8 billion in all  compared with other anti-terrorist operations elsewhere which are costing much more than that.  In an age when the international community has collectively acknowledged that terrorism threatens the very foundations of global and national security  our success in defeating terrorism will benefit  not only the people of Sri Lanka  but all our peace-loving partners in the international community.  Today  we have entered a forward-looking  post-conflict phase  recognizing at the same time the urgent need to deal with the scars and unresolved challenges of the past. In our unique victory in defeating terrorism  we are grateful for the assistance  encouragement and cooperation extended to us by friendly countries and we seek similar understanding in making a steady and stable transition from ending conflict to ensuring lasting peace and security.  We have shared our hopes and concerns with the United Nations. At the end of the conflict and at the invitation of my President  Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa  Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon was the first high-level dignitary to visit Sri Lanka.  With the defeat of the terrorists in May this year  approximately 290 000 civilians in the Vanni region were liberated from their decades-long subjugation. One of our highest priorities thereafter has been to meet the immediate humanitarian needs of these displaced civilians and to ensure their long-term  safe  voluntary and dignified return to their homes.  At present  the welfare of our people in temporary transit sites must keep up with standards that meet our own high expectations as well as accepted international norms. This task has been facilitated by the assistance we receive from United Nations agencies  international and local civil society partners and donors. More than 54 agencies are actively engaged with us in these welfare villages. In addition to providing food and transitional shelter  the welfare villages are equipped with facilities  such as schools  banks  post offices  and health-care centres  to meet the needs of the displaced civilians. In fact  children whose education had been denied them by the terrorists are now for the first time learning to read and write at these sites.  The Government reiterates its firm resolve to resettle the internally displaced persons expeditiously  in cooperation with our international partners. In that regard  we have learned valuable lessons from our own past experiences. In both the post-tsunami context and the successful resettlement programmes in the east of the country completed in the past two years  we realized that the pace of resettlement must not be forced  if it is to be truly safe and sustainable in the long term. For example  against all established humanitarian norms  the terrorist insurgents had indiscriminately scattered landmines and other explosives in every area of civilian habitation in the North. The time-consuming and meticulous process of    09-52592 12  demining is now under way. From another perspective  the stability and security that we have restored at great human cost cannot  and must not  be compromised  particularly when a large number of self-confessed ex-terrorist cadres continue to mix with internally displaced persons.  In the aftermath of conflict  peace cannot last without reconciliation. We have put in place a broad and comprehensive foundation for long-term peace and security encompassing reconstruction  development  political empowerment and reconciliation. Sri Lanka is committed to complying with its international obligations in the field of human rights and humanitarian standards  and will undertake further domestic measures aimed at reconciliation in the light of lessons learned. In less than three months since the conflict in August  we have made significant progress. For the first time in more than a decade  local-government elections were held in the north completely free of any violence and intimidation. In every area where the terrorists had suppressed all dissent in the past  democracy will be restored and electoral processes will be re-established  encouraging a local leadership to emerge.  We must enable those scarred by the conflict to lead productive lives and resume their roles as neighbours and productive citizens. Children were forced into combat by the terrorists’ abhorrent practice of using them as fighting cadres. President Mahinda Rajapaksa has personally launched a national campaign entitled “Bring Back the Child”  and an extensive rehabilitation programme is under way to provide new beginnings for former child combatants. In cooperation with United Nations agencies and donors  we have put in place a national framework for the reintegration of ex-combatants.  With the end of conflict  and for the first time in many decades  Sri Lanka is poised to harness the full human  political and economic potential of the country for the betterment of our people. Donors  international organizations and financial institutions have expressed their confidence in our reconstruction and development plans by making important contributions. After a lapse of many years  the Eastern province has already begun to contribute to the national economy under the Eastern Re-awakening Programme. The Waddakin Wasantham Programme was initiated by President Rajapaksa this year to establish a strong and modern economy in the Northern province. Civilian lives are being normalized with the restoration of former livelihoods  such as farming and fisheries. Already people and produce from the north and east of the country are being transported via previously inaccessible road and rail networks  facilitating people-to-people contact and integrating the economy of the north with that of the rest of the country. Police stations  courts  schools and infrastructure are being re-established.  The end of conflict provides us with a historic opportunity to address the grievances and aspirations of all communities in expediting a long-term political solution. Under the All-Party Representative Committee process  the Government looks forward with a high degree of confidence to obtaining a consensus among all sections of the political spectrum on the proposals envisaged in this regard. The solution that evolves through this process  which we will offer to all communities  must be a home-grown product. Complementary to the long-term political solution envisaged through the All-Party Representative Committee process  an All-Party Committee of Development and Reconciliation has been initiated by President Rajapaksa. That forum reflects the Government’s commitment to a pluralistic and inclusive approach to addressing post-conflict challenges.  The theme of this year’s debate is “Effective responses to global crises — strengthening multilateralism and dialogue among civilizations for international peace  security and development”. The multilateral architecture of the United Nations was created 64 years ago to provide a collective response to global issues in order to achieve peace  security and development. As a result of a multitude of factors  including the accelerated globalization of recent decades  the challenges we are confronted with today are complex and intertwined  and require a holistic  concerted and collective approach.  An individual State alone cannot meet these challenges. Thus multilateralism must be strengthened to meet contemporary global crises such as terrorism  the global financial crisis  the adverse consequences of climate change  food and energy security as well as the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. We need to take necessary measures to ensure that the impact of globalization is fair  inclusive and sustainable. Multilateralism is not about the United Nations agenda responding only to the demands of a minority of powerful States  but also about defending   13 09-52592  the interests of the powerless majority. And it is imperative that the principle reflected in Article 2  paragraph 7  of the Charter — that the Organization should not interfere in the internal affairs of States — be respected. The Charter must be our guiding norm  for it is the Charter that keeps us together. Non-interference in the internal affairs of States must be respected at all times.  In our own region  the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC)  which Sri Lanka chairs at present  has lent its voice to several issues of global importance affecting our region. Among these  terrorism  the impact of the global economic crisis and climate change  as well as food security  are of prime concern to the one fifth of humanity who live in SAARC nations. We in the SAARC region will continue to work in every international forum  including the United Nations  to find regional as well as global solutions that can deal with these issues in an equitable manner.  A global problem such as terrorism  with its transnational linkages  requires an effective and compelling global response. As our experience in Sri Lanka has shown  the transnational character of criminal activities of terrorist groups such as the LTTE required that counter-terrorism operations meticulously carried out on the battlefield be supported by concerted and well-coordinated measures of international cooperation directed against the multifaceted criminal networks of the terrorist organizations. Mrs. Aitimova (Kazakhstan)  Vice-President  took the Chair.  We are aware that much of the financial sustenance for the destruction caused in Sri Lanka by the LTTE came from sources overseas  particularly deep-rooted networks in developed countries. The so-called overseas representatives of the LTTE and their front organizations procured funds and arms through a complex range of criminal activities: terrorist financing  money-laundering  arms procurement  illicit trade and other organized criminal activities  such as drug trafficking and human trafficking  all of which are interrelated.  The remnants of the fast-diminishing LTTE networks overseas continue those efforts to date. Although we have been successful in defeating terrorism in Sri Lanka  we continue to urge our friends and partners in the international community to be vigilant and to continue taking action against illegal acts of the LTTE on their soil.  We are well aware that some of the front organizations exploit noble humanitarian sentiments  and masquerade in the guise of humanitarian non-governmental organizations or even infiltrate them. We thank our partners in the international community that have taken action to expose those organizations.  The threat posed to maritime security through the transportation of large consignments of sophisticated equipment and lethal cargo to provide logistical support to terrorist groups requires our urgent attention. In recent years  Sri Lanka has experienced the most unprecedented and dangerous forms of maritime terrorism. Our navy has successfully confronted and interdicted the movement of virtual floating warehouses of arms and ammunition  which posed a grave threat to the security and stability of our nation and our region.   At the global level  this phenomenon calls for a revision of existing laws pertaining to boarding and searching vessels on the high seas. We need a comprehensive legal framework to address all aspects of the safety and security of maritime navigation  going beyond the current concerns about weapons of mass destruction. That would make a distinct contribution to securing global peace and security.  The comprehensive range of terrorist activities and their disastrous impact on the security and stability of States should awaken all States to consider  very seriously and as a matter of urgency  the importance of forging a global consensus on a comprehensive normative framework for international cooperation and solidarity in combating terrorism  within the parameters of international law.  In this context  I wish to emphasize the urgent need to finalize the ongoing negotiations on the draft comprehensive convention on terrorism. The time has come to reach finality on the outstanding issues and  through the exertion of the necessary political will  to adopt the Convention without further delay.   Sri Lanka  as Chairman of the United Nations Ad Hoc Committee on International Terrorism  remains committed to doing its utmost to reach consensus on the draft comprehensive convention  and looks forward    09-52592 14  to the fullest support of all Member States in this important task.  Today we face the greatest challenge to the world economy in modern times. The global financial and economic crisis  which had its roots in the developed countries  will have a long-term impact on human lives in developing countries. Through the pursuit of prudent policies  Sri Lanka has been able to minimize the impact of the crisis on the domestic financial system and maintain an overall positive rate of growth in the midst of the crisis.  Recovery from the crisis should go well beyond restoring the stability of the economies of the developed countries  and must address the deeper development crisis which ensued in developing countries. The plan of action adopted at the United Nations Conference on the World Financial and Economic Crisis and its Impact on Development urgently needs to be implemented with the support of the international financial institutions and advanced economies. The global financial and economic crisis also highlights the need for transparent multilateral regulatory structures at the helm of the world economy.  The Millennium Declaration set 2015 as the target date for achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  and we are already nearing the target date. Long before the MDGs were articulated globally  Sri Lanka was well on track to reach the related targets in several areas.   Development as it is understood today  and as embodied in the internationally agreed development goals and MDGs  encompasses objectives related to human well-being  including freedom  empowerment  distribution patterns and environmental sustainability. This broad dimension is aligned with Sri Lanka’s pluralistic democratic traditions. Sri Lanka was early among developing countries to understand the importance of investing in human resources  of gender equality and of social development. We are determined to make further progress. We welcome the high-level meeting to be convened by the Secretary-General next year.  As a developing island State  Sri Lanka is highly vulnerable to the adverse impact of climate change caused by unsustainable production and consumption patterns of industrialized countries. The carbon debt owed to us by the developed countries must be used to finance the financial and technological assistance that we need in order to adapt our industries to a sustainable path. As the people of a developing country  our population naturally aspires to achieve progress and higher living standards. We hope that we can reach an agreed outcome at the Copenhagen Conference  in accordance with the principle of common  but differentiated  responsibilities.  Reform of the United Nations and the Security Council must be a high priority. My delegation believes that the objectives of the reform process should be to strengthen multilateralism and to promote greater democracy  transparency  effectiveness and accountability within a more democratic United Nations system. And  in tandem  we need to take measures to pursue the four pillars that are fundamental to our future  as enunciated by President Obama.  My delegation believes that the United Nations — particularly the Assembly — has primary responsibility  as set out in the Charter  for the maintenance of international peace and security. In this context  the numerous unresolved conflicts around the world continue to be a matter of concern.   We are disappointed that little progress has been made in the implementation of General Assembly resolutions regarding the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people to statehood and the realization of the two-State solution  whereby Israel and Palestine could live side-by-side in peace and harmony. A just and lasting peace in the Middle East  including through practical recognition of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people  has been strongly advocated by President Mahinda Rajapaksa. In this regard  we are encouraged by the words spoken by President Obama in his address to the Assembly.  Mr. Treki is presiding over the work of the Assembly at a critical time. As Member States  we must mobilize the political will to shed our differences and work in a spirit of cooperation to respond effectively and swiftly to the challenges that confront us. I reiterate my delegation’s confidence in President Treki’s leadership in this endeavour."
"103",4223,"LSO",64,2009,"Mr. President  the theme that you have chosen for this session of the General Assembly — “Effective responses to global crises: strengthening multilateralism and dialogue among civilizations for international peace  security and development” — is both timely and relevant.   We meet against the backdrop of some of the most serious challenges mankind has confronted in a long time. The financial and economic crisis  climate change and issues of international peace and security are but some of these challenges. No other organization is better placed than the United Nations to find solutions to them.  In June  your predecessor  Mr. President  convened a high-level Conference on the World Financial and Economic Crisis. We all had the opportunity then to identify and agree on the causes and effects of and solutions to this crisis. I shall not revisit the deliberations of that Conference. Suffice it to say that it seems obvious that Governments can no longer abdicate their responsibility of oversight and regulation of the global financial systems to financial institutions.  The least developed and developing countries have been the hardest hit by the financial crisis. Their exports have been severely reduced and their capital flows choked. The impact of the crisis is felt in all aspects of life  be it in the increase in unemployment  illiteracy or the incidence of HIV- and AIDS-related deaths due to the unavailability or unaffordability of drugs.  Lesotho  as a small economy  is highly vulnerable to external shocks and is therefore one of those adversely affected by the financial crisis. Demand for textile exports has dropped dramatically  resulting in unprecedented loss of livelihoods and erosion of the gains we had made in eradicating poverty.  However  all is not lost. I note in this regard the efforts of the Group of Eight  which has pledged a stimulus package of $1.1 trillion  the major part of which will be made available to developing countries. My concern is that this initiative seems to have stalled and it is unclear how the funds will be distributed. It will be fair only if the disbursement is informed by the needs of individual countries  and I hasten to add that the disbursement should be free of quotas and conditions. While I remain optimistic that the pledge will see the light of day  I appeal for the fulfilment of commitments that have been made regarding overseas development aid. I further appeal for the requisite political will to complete the Doha Round of negotiations as a matter of urgency. These negotiations are the anchor of our hope for the dawn of a fair and equitable international trade regime.  I congratulate the Secretary-General on convening the just-ended Summit on Climate Change  at which we were unanimous in our belief that the challenges posed by climate change are beyond the capacity of any individual country to deal with alone. Response to the impact of climate change must be a top priority for the whole of mankind  for at stake here is the preservation of the very elements responsible for the sustenance of human life on our planet.  Lesotho is hopeful that the Copenhagen Conference will usher in a new global agreement that will result in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. We must never forget that at the forefront of those most affected by the impact of climate change are the poor and the innocent. Our call for the industrialized nations to help improve developing countries’ capacity for mitigation and adaptation is therefore not misplaced. Those who are responsible for causing pollution of the environment have the responsibility to make cuts in harmful emissions and to help those adversely affected. We acknowledge that climate change may not be our collective fault  but it is surely our collective responsibility.    09-52586 30   Another challenge confronting us is that of international peace and security. This challenge is a matter of utmost interest to my delegation  for it reminds Governments of their obligation to protect their peoples from mass atrocities  including genocide  ethnic cleansing  war crimes and crimes against humanity. I am referring here to the principle of the responsibility to protect.  The Rwanda genocide is still fresh in our minds. Though the wounds may have healed  the scars remain pronounced and serve as a painful reminder of man’s inhumanity to man. They also serve as a sad reminder of how the international community can fail a people. Beyond Rwanda  and I dare say even post-Rwanda  we have witnessed mass atrocities committed with impunity against the most innocent and vulnerable populations. And sadly  the Security Council  in whose purview the power to act is centralized  has failed to act  thereby incapacitating the international community’s ability to act also.  In our resolve never to fail any population again  we adopted the principle of the responsibility to protect at our 2005 World Summit. This principle seeks to restore the confidence of populations in the United Nations system. In July  the General Assembly held a debate on the Secretary-General’s report on implementing the responsibility to protect (A/63/677). Lesotho welcomes that balanced report  especially the proposed practical measures for its implementation. We view the report as a good basis for negotiations in the General Assembly on how to implement the principle. It is true that the scope of the principle is narrow and limited to genocide  war crimes  ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. I would nonetheless discourage any reopening of the debates on paragraphs 138 and 139 of the World Summit Outcome Document (resolution 60/1).  I find a linkage between this principle and other critical issues that continue to feature on our international agenda. Among these are reform of the United Nations  especially the Security Council  disarmament and the International Criminal Court. Needless to say  the principle of the responsibility to protect is meaningful only if it is grounded in multilateralism and collective action by the international community. The forums through which the responsibility to protect may be achievable is the Security Council and  beyond that  the General Assembly. Unfortunately  the Council  as presently composed  is not capable of exercising effective leadership in this area.  The Security Council reflects the situation that obtained 64 years ago. It is not a true reflection of the current membership of the United Nations. Its composition is therefore irrelevant and undemocratic. For all intents and purposes  the Council lacks legitimacy. For as long as it remains undemocratic  it will continue to fail the vulnerable and defenceless. It will continue to use double standards and remain a tool of the foreign policies of certain States. The desired multilateral path will continue to give way to the unilateral one. It is imperative  therefore  to hasten the United Nations reform process. The intergovernmental negotiations that were held during the sixty-third session of the General Assembly have advanced the reform process a step or two. However  more still needs to be done and rather urgently.  The United Nations was formed on the ashes of the two World Wars. Its main purpose was and still is to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war  which twice in our lifetime has brought untold misery to mankind. But the continuing possession and development of nuclear weapons cast doubt on whether this objective can indeed be realized. At a time when the world is hungering for nuclear disarmament  why should some countries be testing  modernizing and producing new generations of nuclear weapons?  It is our obligation as the international community to strive for a world free of nuclear weapons. We remain disappointed in those countries that are engaged in the testing of nuclear weapons. We must  however  reiterate the right of every country to the development and use of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. The peaceful use of nuclear technology can be beneficial to all mankind.  We are delighted that the third session of the Preparatory Committee for the 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons has adopted the agenda for the 2010 Review Conference. This historic achievement strengthens our optimism that our commitment to the disarmament process will gain renewed momentum and enthusiasm.  In 1998  the Statute establishing the International Criminal Court was adopted in Rome. The Court is  inter alia  an answer to war crimes and crimes against humanity. It safeguards the rule of law in the   31 09-52586  international arena and is therefore well placed to complement the implementation of the principle of the responsibility to protect. Consequently  we should  as the international community  unconditionally extend our support to the Court. We must preserve its integrity and independence. There should be no State or organ of the United Nations that interferes with the Court’s processes. Most importantly  the Court must uphold the highest standards of impartiality  integrity and fairness. Lesotho supports the principle of universal jurisdiction. However  we reject selective application of that noble principle because it erodes its acceptability and credibility.  During the past year  we witnessed a resurgence of piracy off the coast of Somalia. This development has had a negative impact on maritime security and safety. There is a need for the international community to adopt a comprehensive approach to tackling the phenomenon of piracy off the coast of Somalia and beyond. In this regard  Lesotho joins the voices of the heads of State and Government of the African Union in calling for the convening of an international conference to discuss the adoption of an international convention on the phenomenon of maritime piracy and to eradicate its underlying causes.  I would be remiss not to refer to the plight of the peoples of the State of Palestine  the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic and the Republic of Cuba. These are peoples who continue to experience untold suffering  ranging from war to political  economic and social injustices. We call on Israel to cease all settlement activities  including the so-called natural growth in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. By the same token  we call on both sides to cease all acts of hostility and attacks. In particular  Palestine must halt the indiscriminate launching of rockets on Israeli civilians  while Israel must desist from the use of disproportionate force against Palestinian civilians.   We welcome the intensified efforts of the Quartet  the Arab League and other members involved in brokering peace in the Middle East. We are mindful of the fact that the quest for peace in the Middle East should be the responsibility of all of us. We express our solidarity with the people of Palestine. At the same time  we reiterate the inviolability and  indeed  the right to exist of the State of Israel.  The struggle of the Saharan people is a struggle for self-determination based on the principles of decolonization and sovereignty of nations. Both the General Assembly and the Security Council have recognized the inalienable rights of the Saharan people to self-determination and independence. We urge the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic and the Kingdom of Morocco to continue with their negotiations on an equal footing and without any conditions. The aspirations of the Saharan people to self-determination must take paramount priority in these negotiations.  We also hope that the positive signals of engagement between the Republic of Cuba and the United States of America will bring an end to the unfortunate financial and economic embargo imposed on the Republic of Cuba. Lesotho shall continue to support the call for the lifting of the economic embargo against the people of Cuba as a matter of principle and of urgency.  I wish to conclude by saying that no obstacle can beat the might of the United Nations. We must continue to pursue and indeed to cherish the purposes that have brought us together. The responsibility to secure the future of mankind relies heavily on our ability to use a collective approach to resolving the challenges of the world. We cannot ignore our responsibility to build a better and more united world  for the future generations."
"104",4249,"LTU",64,2009,"Today the international community is striving to meet challenges that the founders of the United Nations could not have envisioned some 65 years ago. At the same time  the founding principles of the United Nations have not changed. The provision of joint security and prosperity and the safeguarding of human rights remain the impetus for United Nations activities as they were 60 years ago. Countries that gather here  big and small  have a common responsibility as members of the United Nations to uphold and cherish the ideals expressed in the United Nations Charter.   The global financial and economic crisis is not the only problem today. Terrorism  the proliferation of weapons  energy challenges  climate change and many other issues must be addressed in order to make the goals of the United Nations a reality. Complex challenges require comprehensive responses. It is obvious we cannot benefit from isolationist or egoistic policies.  The United Nations must come of age. It must become the visible and credible expression of the globalization of politics. The modern world dictates that we are dependent on each other. Either we work with each other or suffer in isolation.   Today more than ever before  the United Nations has to play the leading role in strengthening our societies by promoting the shared values of humanity and tolerance. It is our responsibility to make sure that such phenomena as anti-Semitism  xenophobia and racism are eliminated from our lives. There can be no excuse for not bearing this responsibility. Countries big and small alike have duties not only towards their own citizens but also towards global society. But it is usually the poor and vulnerable who suffer the most  especially as the current crisis and the lag in donor commitments push back the hopes of implementing the Millennium Development Goals on schedule. Therefore  with all due regard for the domestic concerns and needs of national taxpayers  we need to adapt to the reality of global complexity and to respect our common responsibility and international commitments. We need to make sure that the Millennium Development Goals do not become the prime victims of the current global economic and financial situation.    09-52320 12   What particular steps should be taken? I will mention several. First  recent United Nations peace operations show that efforts to achieve and consolidate peace entail many dimensions  ranging from peacebuilding to nation-building. Despite its current economic limitations my country is determined to meet its obligations. We will contribute to peace-keeping missions and operations working to ensure global security and stability  specifically by continued participation in the European Union missions in Kosovo  Bosnia and Herzegovina and Afghanistan.  Second  the proliferation of nuclear  chemical and biological weapons will never be halted unless there is an international consensus to do so. The United Nations must strengthen its policy against proliferation; in particular we need to find ways to allow nations to develop civil nuclear power but not nuclear weapons. Therefore the upcoming Review Conference of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons next year will provide a good opportunity to seek diplomatic solutions and work for full compliance with international commitments and requirements.  Third  better and more responsible governance at the global  regional and local levels is crucially important for a steady and sustainable economic recovery. Protectionism and isolationism have never worked and will never work in the future.   Fourth  realizing the fact that global climate change calls for global solutions  we will do our best to reach an international consensus at the Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen. Fully aware of the global impact of climate change  we support the ambitious European Union commitment to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 20 per cent by 2020  within the framework of an international agreement.  Fifth  I think that global responsibility has to be addressed regionally as well — this is the rule for effective implementation of the United Nations Charter. Regional organizations should assume a greater responsibility for taking care of their regions. They must share their best practices with their neighbours and other regional organizations.  Aware of being a comparatively small State  Lithuania is assuming its regional and global responsibility to promote United Nations values through the core principles of dialogue  respect  understanding and tolerance  as it assumes the presidencies of regional and global organizations. Lithuania began its one-year presidency of the Council of the Baltic Sea States as well as the presidency of the Community of Democracies on 1 July 2009  and it will take on the chairmanship of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in 2011. A Lithuania representative will then assume the yearly presidency of the United Nations General Assembly in September 2012 and will complete that term as Lithuania takes on the European Union presidency in the second half of 2013.   It is an immense responsibility to guide the Community of Democracies forward at this point in time. In our view  real progress in development is linked directly to the institution of democratic norms and principles. We believe democracy to be inseparable from peace  the rule of law  respect for individual and human rights  equal opportunity and overall prosperity.   Allow me to reiterate that small or less developed States can no longer avoid global responsibility and that all of us are responsible for our common present and future. Let us all recognize from now on  in each of our capitals  that the global interest is our national interest and global responsibility is our national responsibility."
"105",4293,"LUX",64,2009,"I believe it is fair to say that we have just come through an annus horribilis: a year marked by the worldwide financial and economic crisis  the worst since the Great Depression of 1929; by an increase in hunger and poverty — we are speaking about some 100 million more people sinking into hunger and chronic poverty due to the crisis  and more than 1 billion people suffering from hunger in 2009; by the dramatic rise in unemployment — the International Labour Organization (ILO) indicates that 50 million workers are at risk of losing or have already lost their jobs; by set-backs in the hard-won progress towards the Millennium Development Goals; and by the outbreak of a pandemic. It was also a year during which questions about the relevance of the United Nations and calls for an overhaul of international governance grew ever louder.  Accordingly  we see the need to take stock and draw lessons  namely  to review the major challenges the international community is confronting in terms of development  human rights and the rule of law  peacekeeping and security  disarmament and non-proliferation and the fight against climate change. And what better forum to discuss these issues than the General Assembly of the United Nations?  The economic crisis that hit the world a year ago was even more devastating  as it took place while we were still struggling to cope with  without having overcome them  the food and energy crises  as well as the acceleration  obviously  of climate change.  I have just mentioned the particularly negative impact of the crisis on the poorest. To face those challenges  we need concerted action  coherent action  global action  a true global partnership for development  based on the shared responsibilities of donors and recipients.  My country will continue to assume its share of responsibility by maintaining its efforts in terms of official development assistance (ODA). Having spent 0.95 per cent of its gross national income on ODA in 2008  the Government that was elected in June 2009 has not only confirmed that it maintains the quantitative target of 1 per cent of its gross national income  but will also continue to insist on the qualitative improvement of Luxembourg’s cooperation in order to further increase efficiency  all of it in the    09-52470 44  context of sustainable development integrating economic  social and environmental issues.  Luxembourg calls on all Member States to make the necessary efforts to keep all the commitments that were made together in this forum and that we have reiterated at the Millennium Summit in Monterrey and more recently in Doha.  We must  however  learn the lessons provided by this multidimensional crisis and contemplate a more systemic reform of the existing multilateral system  including the financial and economic architecture  and adapt it to the current political and socio-economic realities.  As I stated in this forum in June at the Conference on the World Financial and Economic Crisis and Its Impact on Development  the United Nations and its principal organs must be at the centre of such a reflection. The Economic and Social Council  which is the central mechanism for coordination and the principal organ of the United Nations responsible for economic and social issues  will have a particularly important role to play in this regard.  Luxembourg  which chairs the Economic and Social Council this year  has assumed its responsibilities in that regard and is working towards full implementation of the various mandates entrusted to the Council by Member States in the framework of the international Conference.  All these actions require a strong multilateral framework based on sound legal rules that are binding on all Member States. In times of crisis  unilateral tendencies unfortunately tend to recur. While it is important that representatives of the major economies of the world meet to discuss common problems  particularly the economic and financial crisis we have experienced in recent months  such forums should not and must not substitute for multilateral structures and existing intergovernmental mandates.  In order to retain the relevance of our multilateral structures  they must be based on trust and cooperation: trust between the citizen and the State  trust among States themselves  whether they are from the North or the South  rich or poor  and confidence of States in the United Nations  which is our common good.  It lies in our hands to assume our responsibilities  to overcome our divisions  to move the thinking and the decision-making forward  and to ensure consistency. It lies in our hands to undertake the necessary reform efforts required for a Security Council that reflects  at last  the geopolitical realities of today  and which is more representative  efficient and transparent; for a revitalized General Assembly  and for a stronger and more effective Economic and Social Council. It lies in our hands to demonstrate the continued relevance of our Organization and its capacity to act and to formulate joint responses  global responses and legitimate responses.  In our globalized world  there is no turning away.  We are all concerned  and the challenges we are facing are of an ever-increasing complexity  including in matters of peace and security. Yesterday  we commemorated the sixtieth anniversary of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA)  an anniversary that one would somehow have preferred not to have to celebrate  for while it allowed us to express our gratitude for the outstanding work done by that United Nations agency in the service of the Palestinian people on a daily basis  it is true  it is also synonymous with failure. Sixty years later  the situation in the Middle East remains unresolved.  While we welcome that the new Administration in the United States is determined to seek a solution based on the coexistence of two States and a comprehensive peace in the Middle East  and while we  together with our European Union partners  are committed to working actively with the United States and other Quartet members  including  obviously  the United Nations  to achieve this goal  at the same time we deeply regret that Israel persists in its policy of colonization.   Mr. Shaheed (Maldives)  Vice-President  took the Chair.  It cannot be repeated too often: the settlement activity is not only illegal under international law  but it is also an obstacle to peace. To continue colonization is to persist in humiliating the Palestinians  in dominating the Palestinian people. Without the clear signal of an end to this policy  it is unlikely that serious negotiations can resume.  We fully support the intention of the President of the United States to engage in negotiations  and we will support him in this endeavour. Annapolis showed that Israelis and Palestinians  when they are alone   45 09-52470  around the negotiating table  are not able to show a level of commitment commensurate with the fundamental problems  namely  Jerusalem  the question of refugees and their right to return  security and the issue of borders.  We call on all parties to shoulder their responsibilities and  through their actions  to establish an environment conducive to the resumption of negotiations to resolve the conflict. The end of divisions among Palestinians and the intra-Palestinian reconciliation that is centred on President Mahmoud Abbas  who has demonstrated in the West Bank that substantial progress in terms of security and governance is possible  are just as much a part of this as the adoption of confidence-building measures by Israel and Arab countries or the simultaneous search for solutions to the conflicts between  on the one hand  Israel and the Syrian Arab Republic and  on the other hand  Israel and Lebanon.  In that context  I would also like to stress just how urgent it is to find a sustainable solution to the crisis in Gaza through the full implementation of Security Council resolution 1860 (2009). An end must be put to the untenable situation of 1.5 million Palestinians living in a prison. Giving hope and motivation to the Palestinian people is a basic human obligation. Light must also be shed on the events in Gaza  including the events following the release of the United Nations fact-finding mission’s report  which has just been published and which has brought shocking acts to light. The credibility of the United Nations is at stake in this matter.  The credibility of the international community too is at stake in a number of respects with regard to the situation in Afghanistan. It is at stake as far as the establishment and maintenance of peace and security is concerned  but also in terms of preserving the rule of law and respect for our fundamental values  ensuring the economic and social development of the country and combating poverty. That was the mandate given to the United Nations back in 2001. It has become clear that  eight years after the adoption of that mandate  the progress made is still not enough. In the light of the increasing number of bloody attacks carried out across the country  the events surrounding the recent presidential elections and the alarming figures in terms of development objectives  public opinion is beginning to wonder whether in fact we are not moving backwards.  There is no easy solution  but there is certainly no alternative to our continued engagement in the country. I would like to stress that  together with our European Union and NATO partners  we will remain engaged alongside the authorities and the people of Afghanistan. There can be no question of abandoning the people  who have been devastated by decades of conflict and violations of their most basic rights. The goal must be a stable and democratic State where all forces  including the Taliban  recognize and respect the rule of law and basic human rights.  Another conflict area that has long been a source of concern and where our hopes of lasting peace were once again called into question in the past year is the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Once again it is civilians who must suffer the consequences. We are seriously concerned about the crimes committed against civilians  especially women and children.  In that context I would like to welcome the draft Security Council resolution that provides for concrete follow-up to resolution 1820 (2008)  on women and peace and security. Luxembourg fully supports that text. I also welcome the personal commitment of the Secretary-General in the fight against sexual violence. It is important that the United Nations system as a whole address the phenomenon of sexual violence  which is used increasingly as a weapon of war in armed conflict even after hostilities have ended. It is essential to strengthen efforts to prevent such acts from happening and to bring to justice those who commit those horrible crimes.  While much remains to be said about the challenges in terms of the maintenance of peace and security  especially in the context of the current debate on the future of peacekeeping operations — a debate that I applaud — allow me to dwell for a moment on the current encouraging developments in the field of disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation.  I welcome President Obama’s initiative to engage the Security Council in a broader discussion of issues pertaining to non-proliferation and disarmament  beyond the specific area of issues related to sanctions. As we are only a few months from the eighth Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)  it is important that we demonstrate our determination to carry out that task as regards the three pillars of the    09-52470 46  NPT  the ultimate goal being a world free of nuclear weapons.  The same goes for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT)  the other cornerstone of the nuclear non-proliferation regime. As I said yesterday during the meeting of States that have ratified the CTBT  the call of the Security Council to sign and ratify the CTBT and the commitment of President Obama to do everything possible to ensure ratification in the United States are crucial. The Treaty must at last enter into force. We hope that those encouraging developments will lead others to adopt a more constructive attitude  with full respect for their international obligations.  Beyond non-proliferation issues  however  we must not overlook disarmament itself. In that regard  we certainly welcome the decision of the United States and the Russian Federation to conduct negotiations to conclude a new comprehensive agreement following the expiry of the START II Treaty next December.  Allow me as well to say a few words about an issue that is also relevant in terms of security and defence. I am referring to the welcome decision — in my opinion  at least — by the United States Administration to abandon the effort to put in place a missile defence shield. It always seemed to me that the way forward in that regard was not to adopt unilateral measures  but to engage in discussion and cooperation with our Russian partners with a view to ensuring our common security.  I cannot conclude without saying a few words about climate change  which is perhaps the greatest challenge to world prosperity in the long term. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Secretary-General once again for convening the summit of 22 September. That resulted in political mobilization at the highest level  which is crucial if we want to make the Copenhagen Conference a success and set a new course towards sustainable development and green growth that reduces carbon emissions.  The scientific evidence exists. It is now up to us to respond with determination in facing those facts. Developed countries will have to set the example by agreeing to ambitious and higher than average targets to reduce carbon dioxide by 2050. They must do so by entering into binding legal commitments  including for the medium term  in the context of an effective and universal international regime to which countries contribute on the basis of their capacity.  Moreover  the issue of adaptation to climate change — including also the financing of related efforts  which will necessarily constitute an additional expense — should be treated as a priority at Copenhagen. Allow me to note in passing that the disarmament efforts that I have just described should free up financial resources that could be put to better use in this regard.  Meanwhile  together with its partners in the European Union  Luxembourg has already committed itself to reach the so-called 20-20-20 goal of increasing energy efficiency in the European Union by 20 per cent  increasing renewable energy by 20 per cent of total energy consumption and reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent compared to 1990 levels. Beginning several years ago  Luxembourg began to systematically incorporate the issue of adaptation to climate change in its development programmes.  Climate change  however  will have an impact not only on development  but also on the full enjoyment of human rights and on the security of countries. I therefore very much welcome the report produced by the Secretary-General following the initiative taken in that regard by Pacific small island developing States  which addresses the full scope of the problem.  Luxembourg remains firmly convinced of the relevance of a multilateral approach in which the United Nations is at the centre. We will continue to base our policies and make our contributions with a view to creating a world that is more just  more peaceful and more prosperous  as enshrined in our founding Charter. It is also because of this passionate motivation to work towards a strong and effective multilateralism that Luxembourg  a founding Member of the United Nations  aspires to become  for the first time  a non-permanent member of the Security Council in 2013-2014.

"106",4319,"LVA",64,2009,"I wish to begin by congratulating the President on his assumption of the presidency at this session of the General Assembly. I pledge Latvia’s full support to him.  This year marks the twentieth anniversary of a unique peaceful demonstration  namely  the Baltic Way. On 23 August 1989  more than 1 million people joined hands in a 600-kilometre-long human chain across the three Baltic countries of Estonia  Latvia and Lithuania. That event was dedicated to the fiftieth anniversary of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact between the Stalinist Soviet Union and Nazi Germany. The Pact was another mile marker leading to the Second World War and the occupation of the three Baltic States.  The Baltic Way served as a powerful symbol of the drive for democracy and freedom in our three States. The importance of the Baltic Way was so substantial that the United Nations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization added it to the Memory of the World Register. The message of the Baltic Way is very clear  namely  that if people and countries truly commit to a common goal  and if they join their efforts  even the most difficult challenge can be met successfully.  A look at today’s world reveals that never before has international cooperation been so important. Never before have we faced such a multitude of simultaneous critical challenges of global significance. Many phrases have been coined to describe the most severe problems: the “three Es” crisis  for energy  economy and environment  and the “three Fs” crisis  for finance  food and fuel. But no matter what name we use we must remember that those global issues require urgent and concerted action at the global level.  Since we met here last year  the financial crisis has turned into a global economic crisis. It has struck the world with its full strength. Consequences are being felt by every State and by every economy. They have an effect on international policy and make us reconsider domestic policies as well. Latvia has undertaken painful but necessary adjustments to the downturn. We have learned our lessons. I am confident that our economy and the entire global economic system will come out of the crisis stronger than before.  Current realities are serving to underline the values of inclusiveness  tolerance and compassion  not only domestically but also in the international arena. It is self-evident that we can tackle the challenges only by joint efforts. We should use the crisis as a catalyst for looking beyond our individual gains. We should therefore use it to look at how we can promote an open international trade system. We hope for the prompt conclusion of the long-overdue round of talks on the Doha Development Agenda.  Development is hard in times of crisis. Developing countries are particularly severely affected by its negative effects. We are well aware of the risk of jeopardizing what has been done in achieving the Millennium Development Goals. We must not give up. Latvia is honouring its commitments to achieving the Millennium Development Goals.  Climate change is a global challenge that needs to be tackled at the global level. The United Nations Summit on Climate Change has demonstrated that it is important to reach a comprehensive and fair agreement on future global climate policy at the Copenhagen Conference  to be held in December of this year. Such an agreement should follow the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. Every country should contribute according to its capabilities  but the political will of every nation is what matters most.  The stability and security situation in a number of countries and regions of the world is of particular concern to the global community. Afghanistan is certainly one of them. The holding of presidential elections in a fragile security situation was a significant achievement by the Afghan people. It is crucial to pursue balanced international involvement in   21 09-52425  Afghanistan  which should include both a civilian surge and military efforts. We must continue our assistance to Afghanistan and other countries in the region in order to prevent the threat of festering terrorism. It is important to understand that the value of local knowledge of the situation and of regional involvement cannot be overestimated. We remain committed to the rebuilding process in Afghanistan while paying special attention to upgrading its infrastructure and strengthening its economy. Latvia has contributed both military and civilian assistance to the development of Afghanistan.  Achieving peace in the Middle East is another issue that remains at the top of the international agenda. The two-State idea will become a reality only when the Israeli Government sincerely works to make it one. It will become a sustainable reality only when Palestinian leaders settle their own differences in the interests of their people. This year  Latvia provided a rehabilitation programme for 18 Palestinian boys and girls. They came to Latvia to participate in our rehabilitation programme for traumatized children from the Gaza Strip. Those children came to overcome the psychological impact of the conflict they experienced earlier this year.  Latvia would like to reiterate its firm support for the security and stability of Georgia  which must be based on full respect for the principles of independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity as recognized by international law. The security situation in and around Georgia is still very fragile. We regret that the Security Council failed to agree on the continuation of the United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia. Unfortunately  despite all the efforts by the international community  the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) was forced to close its Mission in Georgia.  As a result  this year we lost two important international instruments for promoting stability and peaceful conflict resolution in Georgia. Latvia strongly believes that the international community should continue to look for a solution. We should work to secure a full and effective United Nations and OSCE presence in Georgia  including in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Meanwhile  it is ever more important to strengthen the only remaining international mission  namely  the European Union Monitoring Mission in Georgia  which has convincingly proven its pivotal role in stabilizing the situation on the ground. We would also like to stress the importance of the resolution on the status of internally displaced persons and refugees from the Georgian regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. The resolution is an important show of commitment to fundamental humanitarian principles.  Choosing leadership is the right and the responsibility of the people. We recently witnessed the post-electoral crisis in Iran. We are concerned about the deteriorating human rights situation and the violent crackdowns there. If the Iranian Government seeks recognition as the representative of its people  it should respect human rights. If the Iranian Government seeks the respect of the international community  it should comply with the relevant resolutions of the Security Council. By doing so  Iran could become a genuine contributor to peace and stability in the whole region.  Latvia has been steadfast in the global efforts to combat the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. We are sure that the 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons will be an important milestone in that process. Latvia is convinced that it will promote the aims of non-proliferation  disarmament and the use of nuclear energy for exclusively peaceful purposes.  This fall we will celebrate the sixtieth anniversary of the four Geneva Conventions. The character of armed conflict is constantly changing  and new challenges  such as terrorism  arise. Still  the Geneva Conventions remain the bedrock of international humanitarian law. Unfortunately  the political will to fully implement the Conventions remains insufficient. Violations of the provisions of the Conventions and the norms of human rights law still occur.  Latvia therefore strongly supports the International Criminal Court. It is a mechanism designed to fight impunity and to promote compliance with the norms of international law. Latvia commends the work of the Court. We also call on all States to fully cooperate with it.   Mr. Gomes (Guinea-Bissau)  Vice-President  took the Chair.  The concept of the responsibility to protect was agreed upon at the 2005 World Summit. Latvia supports that concept. It is important to work towards its implementation. It would help us to create a world    09-52425 22  order where inactivity in the face of mass atrocities becomes a thing of the past.  Three years ago  the General Assembly decided to establish the Human Rights Council. The Council has already achieved some results. The Universal Periodic Review mechanism is one of its most notable successes. However  we believe that that process can be further improved to avoid abuse of its shortcomings in methodology and practice. The Human Rights Council will undergo a review in 2011. We believe that the Council can become even more credible  as well as an effective body for the promotion and protection of human rights.  Latvia has a long-standing commitment and experience with promoting human rights. We are ready to share our experience in that area with the international community. Latvia has therefore put forward its candidacy for the Human Rights Council for the year 2014.  Latvia has always supported the strengthening of the United Nations. The reform of the Security Council  aimed at enhancing the effectiveness and legitimacy of its work  is an important part of the overall reform of the United Nations. The composition of the Security Council must reflect the realities and dynamics of today’s world. Latvia welcomes the beginning of intergovernmental negotiations on Security Council reform. We also emphasize the importance of continued progress in that area.  We note with concern that  at a time of global recession  the United Nations budget is increasing considerably. It is important to prioritize activities and to continue the reform of the United Nations. We would also like to see more transparency and budgetary discipline in the process of budget planning and implementation.  Latvia is a candidate for next year’s elections to the Economic and Social Council. We are willing to share our experience in addressing global challenges  such as sustainable development  poverty eradication  the implementation of good governance and the rule of law  fundamental freedoms and environmental stability.   Latvia is already building up its expertise on the functional commissions and activities related to the mandate of the Council. We are an active participant in the United Nations Forum on Forests  the Commission on Science and Technology for Development  the Statistical Commission  and the Commission on Sustainable Development.  The United Nations is the only truly universal forum for dialogue and action. All States  big and small  have the responsibility to contribute to the fruitful work of the United Nations. Let me assure the President that Latvia is ready to work closely with him and all Member States to make the sixty-fourth session of the General Assembly a successful one."
"107",4366,"MAR",64,2009,"On behalf of the Kingdom of Morocco  I should like to congratulate you warmly  Sir  on your election to the presidency of the General-Assembly of the United Nations at its sixty-fourth session. We are proud to see a son of a brotherly country from our region at the helm of this universal body. You may rest assured that our delegation is prepared fully to support your endeavours aimed at ensuring a greater role for our Organization in meeting the challenges of today’s world.  I wish also to seize this opportunity to express our appreciation and support to His Excellency Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his tireless efforts not only to realize the objectives for which our Organization was created  but also to enable the Organization to fulfil the aspirations of the peoples of the world in the course of this third millennium.  The global crises  owing to their universal impact  multifaceted nature and wide implications  have given additional impetus to our collective action and strengthened coordination among the different constituents of this universal body. Today  the world is facing recurrent and unprecedented crises in the fields of economics  finance  food and energy that have shaken the foundations of universal governance. These crises have also adversely affected the socio-economic and environmental systems of all States  especially in developing countries.  As the most representative Organization in the world  the United Nations embodies the living conscience of the international community. As such  it is the most appropriate forum for coordinated joint action and for the reactivation of collective initiatives in order to analyse the root causes of such crises and contain their impact through the adoption of agreed solutions likely to mitigate their effects. Effective and    09-52586 50  fair economic governance is dependent on the revitalization of the multilateral system based on realism  efficiency and innovation as a means of finding solutions that reflect the aspirations and hopes of present and future generations.  The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) were adopted as a common platform for action with clear objectives and a time frame for their implementation  with a view to achieving human development in the world. Much progress has been achieved in many States thanks to the efforts of the international community since the Millennium Summit. However  the progress made towards those goals has not been consistent or steady within States or among States in general. The negative implications of the current economic crisis may exacerbate those disparities  especially in Africa. The few years that remain before 2015 thus require us to adopt a coordinated global approach and to build real partnerships in order to mobilize additional financial resources in line with the commitments made in the Monterrey Consensus and the Doha Declaration on Financing for Development as well as in the declarations of the Group of Eight and the Group of 20.  In this context  Morocco hopes that the fourth high-level meeting on financing for development  to be held in November 2009 in New York  will yield results commensurate with the expectations of the developing countries  thus giving new impetus to efforts to attain the Millennium Development Goals  thus leading to the formation of an international alliance for African development in the framework of coordinated efforts and initiatives aimed at achieving the Goals within specific time frames. We also hope that the United Nations agencies that are active in the area of development will mainstream the Millennium Development Goals and use them as the main and appropriate framework for their action. In this context  the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in particular should use the Millennium Development Goals as practical and comprehensively agreed upon indicators when drafting its report on human development. The MDGs provide a practical and qualitative  not only quantitative  way to measure living that better reflects the ever-evolving concept of development.  In keeping with this vision  the National Initiative for Human Development  launched in May 2005 by His Majesty Mohammed VI  constitutes a pillar of Moroccan social policy. The initiative is based on an integrated approach to development in all its aspects — political  economic  social  environmental and cultural. By building roads  providing energy services and encouraging income-generating activities  the Initiative has achieved concrete results in fighting poverty and exclusion  improving infrastructure and de-marginalizing rural areas.  Collective efforts in the field of development will remain insufficient unless they are accompanied by daring and effective policies for the protection of the environment and concrete measures to mitigate the impact of climate change  which now more than ever is threatening the future of mankind. In that connection  Morocco is convinced that the conference on climate change to be held in Copenhagen in December will undoubtedly constitute an important step towards an international agreement on climate. In that regard  Morocco reiterates the proposal it made at the conference held at Poznan  Poland  in December 2008 for the creation of a multilateral fund for the transfer of technology to the developing countries in order to enable them to deal with the grave implications of climate change.  Mindful of the necessity to operationalize concrete measures to protect the environment and contain the negative impact of climate change  His Majesty Mohammed VI instructed the Government to draft swiftly a comprehensive national environmental charter  with the aim of protecting national resources and reserves as part of a sustainable development policy. The environment should be considered a shared national heritage whose protection is the collective duty of current and future generations. Likewise  Morocco will reactivate its national energy strategy aimed at the development of renewable energy sources and the recycling of waste water.  Convinced that the peace process is the only viable option in the Middle East  the Kingdom of Morocco has participated constructively and responsibly in all efforts of the international community to relaunch the peace process on solid foundations. That means that the process must be in accordance with resolutions of international legality  the previous relevant agreements and commitments among the parties concerned  and the Arab Peace Initiative  which as a realistic option reflects the collective Arab will to arrive at a just and comprehensive solution that guarantees the right of the   51 09-52586  Palestinian people to create their own independent State  with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital  an Israeli withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories  including Syrian and Lebanese territories  and a stable  secure and peaceful existence for all peoples of the region.  The Kingdom of Morocco expresses its appreciation to the United States Administration for its efforts and for the encouraging positions taken by President Obama. We hope that it will persevere in order to overcome obstacles to a resumption of negotiations. We also commend all other international efforts  including European efforts  to that end.   Those efforts will be productive only if Israel halts its illegal practices  which prevent the achievement of peace. Those practices  in particular the building of settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories and the unjust blockade against our brotherly Palestinian people  run counter to the peace option. The settlement activities and the expulsions taking place in Al-Quds  aimed at altering the legal and demographic status of that holy city  are flagrant violations of international instruments and require urgent action on the part of all peace-loving countries.   In that regard  His Majesty Mohammed VI  in his capacity as Chairman of the Al-Quds Committee  has always warned the international community against the risks associated with altering the legal status of Al-Quds. He has also been urging the influential international Powers to swiftly implement the requirements of international legitimacy in order to preserve the religious  cultural and spiritual features of the holy city in such a way as to create appropriate conditions conducive to the resumption of the peace process.  The achievement of peace through the peaceful resolution of conflicts is the essence of the historical mandate of the United Nations. It should be based on the principles of equality among States and respect for their independence and territorial integrity  in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations. In addition  there is a need to eliminate all weapons of mass destruction and to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.   As a member of the Peacebuilding Commission  Morocco will continue its relevant activities  including by mobilizing efforts in support of African countries. Such efforts are being made within the framework of South-South cooperation  with concrete projects  defined goals and shared benefits and in keeping with the priorities of Moroccan foreign policy as determined by His Majesty King Mohammed VI. As one of the first active participants in United Nations peacekeeping missions  Morocco has always taken a keen interest in United Nations efforts to enhance such operations as part of the new partnership proposed to adapt to international developments and the requirements for lasting peace.  Furthermore  recent developments in the area of disarmament provide reason for optimism. The positions expressed and the statements made at the highest levels augur well and maintain the momentum for disarmament and non-proliferation efforts. We hope that efforts will be made at the international and regional levels for the entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty  given the outcome of the meeting on article 14 of the Treaty  which I had the honour to co-chair last Thursday with my colleague  the Minister for Foreign Affairs of France.   Since its establishment  the United Nations has endeavoured to promote international and regional cooperation to uphold the principles of coexistence  peace  good-neighbourliness and consultation at a time when regional economic gatherings are playing a pivotal role in addressing economic  security and environmental issues. Convinced of that role  Morocco has taken a keen interest in promoting good-neighbourly relations in nearby African  Maghreb and Mediterranean regions. Likewise  Morocco supports the Mediterranean Union as a promising framework for increasing dialogue and cooperation between the two sides of the Mediterranean. Moreover  on 4 August 2009  mindful of the important role of the Atlantic Ocean and the opportunities it provides for collective action  Morocco launched an initiative aimed at cooperation among African countries bordering the Atlantic as the basis for a broader partnership with other coastal countries in that geo-strategic region.   His Majesty King Mohammad VI has reaffirmed Morocco’s strong and enduring resolve to contribute in good faith to the consolidation of the Arab Maghreb Union  the reactivation of its structures and the strengthening of relations among its members  including brotherly Algeria. Indeed  that regional body could play a central role in building fruitful partnerships and in ensuring security and stability in    09-52586 52  Africa  the Middle East and the Mediterranean. Our belief that the Arab Maghreb project must be reactivated as an embodiment of our peoples’ hopes and aspirations is in keeping with our sincere desire to work to remove all obstacles to the realization of our peoples’ expectations and the consolidation of brotherly relations among its five members.   In that regard  Morocco has responded responsibly and in good faith to the appeals of the Security Council for efforts to find a political  lasting and negotiated solution to the regional dispute over the Moroccan Sahara. A bold autonomy initiative  regarded as serious and credible by the international community  has been proposed as a promising and realistic basis for a lasting solution to that artificial conflict.  With the same resolve and responsibility  Morocco  with the support of the Security Council  has been engaged in the new dynamic resulting from its initiative aimed at negotiations under United Nations supervision. In its resolutions 1813 (2008) and 1871 (2009)  the Council called for serious and intense negotiations in a spirit of compromise and realism with a view to finding a political  lasting and negotiated solution that is in keeping with the principle of self-determination and that cannot be monopolized by anyone or selectively interpreted to conceal undeclared objectives and a hidden agenda. Morocco will continue its full cooperation with the Secretary-General and his  Personal Envoy to find a definitive solution to this regional dispute that fully respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Morocco and grants autonomous status to the population of the Sahara provinces  which is likely to ensure their progress and well-being and enable them to manage their domestic affairs in a democratic manner.  The Kingdom of Morocco has always been at the forefront of international and regional initiatives aimed at promoting the values of dialogue  tolerance and openness to others  especially as they relate to the necessary dialogue between Islam and the West and to respecting universal human rights standards  as prevalent as they are all over the world.  Based on those convictions  Morocco will continue to promote its fruitful cooperation and positive dialogue at the bilateral  regional and global levels. Motivated by the same spirit of commitment  the Kingdom of Morocco will assume its responsibility and will play its role fully within the main United Nations bodies  with a view to reinforcing the Organization’s efficiency  credibility and contribution.  May the blessings  peace and mercy of Allah be upon all participants."
"108",4390,"MCO",64,2009,"My participation in this general debate  like that of more than 100 heads of State and Government  confirms both the seriousness of the choices we must make in the face of the challenges confronting our States and the unavoidable role of the United Nations in deciding on the future of our planet and its inhabitants.  More than ever before  the General Assembly must be the “centre for harmonizing the actions of nations” in the attainment of the common ends defined in Article 1 of the Charter. To remain the vital centre  the Organization and its most representative body of the community of nations — our General Assembly — must better take into consideration the interdependence that links our destinies and the opportunity presented to our sovereign States to bestow upon our fellow countrymen a common vision marked by moral values.  The financial storm that swept through the world a year ago has caused too much suffering and too much harm to the global economy  at a time in our history when we are confronted with the major challenges of the climate crisis and the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  for us not to draw obvious conclusions.  A year from now  we will meet again in this same forum to take stock of the progress we have made in the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The 2015 deadline — which already seemed compromised on the eve of this multidimensional crisis — requires that we define a global vision for the future of humankind. Some will call it solidarity or moral awareness. Whatever the   11 09-52228  name  we need to clearly define and implement the MDGs to meet the basic needs of all human beings.  If poverty eradication is to remain our priority  we will have to get busy on fulfilling our obligations  for the most destitute are also the ones who are hungry  who suffer from malnutrition and who lack access to water and to basic social and health services. Among the main victims are women and children  25 000 of whom die each day  according to UNICEF.  Several hundred thousand people today benefit from actions undertaken by my country in the framework of its international cooperation in the fields of health  education and the fight against poverty. This is why I requested that we continue our effort to contribute 0.7 per cent of our GDP by 2015 to official development assistance. This assistance must not be sacrificed because of the present economic and financial situation. On the contrary  it must be strengthened at a time when the most vulnerable are the ones who need it the most. This development assistance must be accompanied by long-term investments aimed at strengthening the capacity-building of developing countries  in particular through the transfer of appropriate technologies with a view to respecting the requirements of sustainable development.  From this perspective  and in the light of the recent food crisis  the time is right to restore agriculture to its proper place  because food security depends on it. Today  it is up to us to forge for future generations a new destiny  “a new deal”. We must move from being donors to become partners in a green revolution in Africa  where food-producing agriculture adapted to the specific conditions of the continent must empower the local populations.  The restoration of agriculture to the heart of our civilization also raises the crucial issue of water. Whether regarding access to it for the survival of our populations  for farming or for energy production  it is imperative to guarantee water security. Therefore  an integrated management of water resources is needed. We must be aware of the potential disasters and conflicts that would arise if we failed  and of risks linked to poor sanitation that could cause outbreaks of infectious diseases and pandemics.  The phenomena of desertification and drought  as well as the acidification of seas and oceans  are exacerbated by man-made climatic change. This is why failure of the Copenhagen negotiations is not an option. My commitment  and that of my worldwide counterparts  as stated yesterday in the framework of the climate change summit convened by the Secretary-General  is unequivocal: we must  together — developed countries  countries with high carbon dioxide emissions and developing countries — succeed in defining a post-Kyoto regime that will be decidedly in line with a low-carbon-emission future.  For too long  we have neglected the scientific warnings. More than 20 years ago  the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was created by the World Meteorological Organization. During the third World Climate Conference at the beginning of September which  with great pleasure  I attended  it was decided to establish a Global Framework for Climate Services  with a view to helping populations meet this increasingly pressing challenge.  This Global Framework  which we fully support  aims at improving the management of the risks of climate fluctuations and climate change as well as adaptation to climate change at all levels  through development and the incorporation of science-based information and forecasting into policies and planning. The unparalleled mobilization of public opinion compels us to adopt innovative measures to slow global warming  whose consequences could be catastrophic.  The Trade and Development Report recommends deep structural changes  which will not happen unless we are willing to challenge our patterns of production and consumption. The setting up of a green economy must be the basis of such a process. Our role  as political decision makers  is to ensure that the necessary technology — which already exists — is put to use to reduce greenhouse gases. Sustainable development requires the globalization of green technologies and environmental assets.  On behalf of the Principality  I reiterate our stated ambition to become carbon neutral and our resolve to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent by 2020 and by 60 per cent by 2050.  During these past few months  the world economy has been sorely tried and tested. Signs of recovery are beginning to show  but we must draw lessons from this grim year. The globalization of the economy and the resulting interdependence require    09-52228 12  reform of the international monetary and financial system.  Created 10 years ago  the Group of 20 (G-20) met for the first time at the level of heads of State or Government last November  thereby acknowledging the urgency of adopting measures to save the world economy from a disaster worsened by the panic reigning in the financial markets. Monaco acknowledges that this group  which represents two thirds of the world’s population and trade and close to 90 per cent of the world gross domestic product  bears special responsibility vis-à-vis the rest of the international community.  We are confident of the capacity of the G-20  tomorrow in Pittsburgh  to lay the foundations for a new era encompassing  inter alia  financial regulation  financial traders’ income  governance and resources allocated to international financial institutions. The G-20’s ability to bring together all States will give rise to the legitimacy necessary for renewed growth.  For several months  my Government has been working to fulfil the commitments it undertook and to comply with the required norms of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) with a view to improve transparency and exchanges of fiscal and banking information. That is why my Government has already signed 12 bilateral conventions and has undertaken to conclude other agreements in this area. As of today  Monaco has had its efforts acknowledged by the OECD and will thus now be included on its White List.  But let us make no mistake: the breach of trust resulting from the financial disaster has made it more necessary than ever before that the measures taken by the G-20 be non-discriminatory and bring together all Member States. A consultative body would thus ensure the legitimacy of any decisions made.  We must  together  rebuild solid foundations for a capitalism with a human face that promotes growth and social development. Current circumstances have provided us the opportunity to create a green economy  one which associates job creation with the transfer of new technologies which will enable us to achieve a sustained recovery.  The State must continuously adapt its role and the expression of its sovereignty to new realities in order to remain the guarantor of the security and social well-being of populations. The United Nations cannot avoid this either. Since its creation  the Organization has worked for the maintenance of international peace and security through operations led under its flag. It has also played a prominent federative role in the field of disarmament and non-proliferation.  Human and material resources available to peacekeeping operations have reached levels that would have not been conceivable only a decade ago. The necessary consideration of this matter initiated within the Security Council and the Secretariat  as well as with Member States  is a priority and we support it.  What is just as important is the strengthening of the rule of law and of democratic institutions  guardians of sovereignty and the peaceful coexistence of States. In this respect  I wish to reiterate the support of my country for the implementation of the responsibility to protect  which is symbolic of the strengthening of multilateralism for the good of populations. The responsibility to protect does not affect the exercise of responsible sovereignty  which places the individual at the forefront. Monaco will continue to work with its partners — that is  each and every one in this Hall — to implement best practices in the field of protection  international assistance and capacity-building  with the sole objective of saving lives.  The Principality will keep responding  in solidarity  to emergency humanitarian situations  especially when it comes to assisting women and children  whose vulnerability in crisis situations  unfortunately  no longer needs to be demonstrated.   In 2010  we will celebrate the International Year for the Rapprochement of Cultures and the International Year of Biodiversity. These themes symbolize  at the outset of the twenty-first century  the harmony that we must seek both among our people — with acceptance of our differences — and between the human species and the other living species on Earth  which we have the duty to protect and save from extinction.  I can assure the Assembly that my country will continue to tirelessly commit itself to processes likely to build and strengthen the ties between our societies in order to promote dialogue and cultural and religious understanding based on mutual respect  such as the Union for the Mediterranean and the Alliance of Civilizations.    13 09-52228   I am convinced that the President’s great experience at the United Nations and his role in the creation of the African Union are great pluses for the success of his very sensitive mission."
"109",4415,"MDA",64,2009,"I am deeply honoured to address the General Assembly on behalf of the Republic of Moldova. At the outset  I would like to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session  to wish him success and to assure his Bureau of the full support of our delegation. I would also like to pay tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  for his high competence and professionalism  and his tireless efforts in leading the United Nations in these complex times.  The distinguished speakers who have taken the floor in this debate have elaborated extensively on the most pressing issues that the international community has faced over the past year. The current financial and economic crisis  the food and energy crises  the first flu pandemic of this century  and climate change have been at the core of deliberations in the United Nations  revealing the central role of the Organization in dealing with these problems. A reformed  robust and effective Organization has to deliver prompt reactions and sustainable responses to the major challenges to peace  security and development: disarmament and non-proliferation  climate change  food and energy security  and the spread of international terrorism.  We commend the efforts of the Secretary-General in strengthening the United Nations and promoting the core values enshrined in our founding Charter: the fundamental principles of peace  justice and human rights. The Republic of Moldova supports the ongoing process of reform of the United Nations aimed at creating a revitalized  representative  efficient and more responsive Organization. Following significant advances in the reform of its principal organs  we recognize the steps being undertaken towards reform of the Security Council  which undoubtedly necessitates a firm political pledge on the part of the entire membership.   In our opinion  the expansion of the Security Council is a matter not only of equity but also of efficiency. Any proposal for reform of the Council has to reflect the legitimate aspirations of the regional groups. Thus  in supporting the expansion of the Council in both permanent and non-permanent categories  we believe it indispensable to allocate an additional non-permanent seat to the Eastern European Group.  By virtue of the primary responsibility of the Security Council laid down in the United Nations Charter  its reform should also contain provisions for consolidating United Nations operational capacities in the field and revitalizing peacekeeping operations in order to make them more effective and capable of achieving their goals  including the development of cooperation with regional organizations and Member States for the resolution of conflicts in various areas of the globe.  Building a safer world requires the greater commitment of Member States in the area of disarmament  arms control and non-proliferation. We have recently witnessed a historic summit of the Security Council  which voted to stop the spread of nuclear arms and endorsed a broad framework of action to reduce global nuclear dangers. The Republic of Moldova welcomes the results of the most recent Conference on Facilitating the Entry into Force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty  and looks forward to continued positive trends in the work of the Conference on Disarmament and the Preparatory Committee for the Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.  The current global economic and financial crisis  one of the most serious since the creation of the United Nations  has affected virtually all countries  including the Republic of Moldova. In 2008  the previous Communist Government in Chisinau denied the existence of an economic and financial crisis; only after its defeat in the elections of 29 July 2009 did its representatives begin to raise the alarm.  The current administration  the Alliance for European Integration  is assuming full responsibility   09-53165 24  for managing the economic crisis by attracting funds from international financial organizations  securing foreign investment  providing jobs  reviving the real sector of the economy  ensuring the de-monopolization of production sectors  and liberalizing exports and imports. The liberal democratic Government relies on the support of United Nations institutions and all international structures in promoting the rule of law  safeguarding fundamental human rights and freedoms  and ensuring the functionality of democratic institutions and the freedom of mass media.  The Republic of Moldova followed intently the work of the high-level Conference on the World Financial and Economic Crisis and Its Impact on Development  held this summer at the United Nations  and welcomed the adoption of its Outcome Document (resolution 63/303). The Conference highlighted once again the role of the United Nations and gave a strong impetus to the dialogue on identifying solutions for overcoming the crisis and reforming the international financial architecture.   At the same time  Moldova stands for strengthening the Economic and Social Council’s coordinating role in formulating global economic and social policies and in further promoting active dialogue with the international financial institutions and the Governments of Member States in implementing the Millennium Development Goals.  Nine years ago  in September 2000  the world’s leaders committed our countries to a global partnership in fighting poverty and achieving the Millennium Development Goals. Today  in the context of the global economic and financial crisis  considerable common efforts on the part of developed and developing countries alike are needed to achieve our commitments by 2015. We welcome the decision to convene a high-level meeting in 2010 dedicated to evaluating the Millennium Summit decisions.  The General Assembly has proclaimed 2009 the International Year of Reconciliation and the International Year of Human Rights Learning  and 21 September as an International Day of Peace. It is in this vein that we would like to reiterate the necessity for an increased United Nations role and strengthened cooperation with regional organizations  such as the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe  in preventing and managing crisis and conflict situations; guaranteeing respect for and the promotion of fundamental human rights in separatist regions; undertaking more efficient international actions to stabilize the situation in countries affected by internal conflict; and taking a complex approach under international law to mediation and conflict resolution. The intensification of international cooperation with a view to solving conflicts and preventing the future emergence or escalation of crisis situations that threaten the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States is of paramount importance for the Republic of Moldova  which faces a secessionist movement in the eastern regions of the country.   Respecting the principle of the peaceful resolution of conflicts  we are confident that the demilitarization and democratization of the Transdniestrian region are indispensable to a viable solution to the Transdniestrian problem. The new Liberal Democratic Government’s coalition will undertake sustainable efforts to identify a lasting solution to the Transdniestrian problem in the current five plus two format and will consistently urge an increased United States and European Union (EU) role in the resolution process. Concurrently  the Republic of Moldova will revive its efforts towards the withdrawal of foreign troops from the country  replacing the present peacekeeping operation with a multinational mission with an international mandate  and achieving the integration of the country in all socio-economic segments by encouraging the broad participation of the non-governmental sector.   We will consistently act in accordance with the law on the basic provisions of the Special Legal Status of Localities from the Left Bank of the Dniester River  adopted unanimously by Parliament on 22 July 2005. Focused on the creation of conditions needed for reconciliation and advancing the resolution process  we put forward a series of initiatives in 2007 to strengthen trust and security between the two banks of the Dniester River  in particular by ensuring free movement  instituting common participation in developing and implementing projects to restore and modernize infrastructure  and addressing various social issues.   Unfortunately  the so-called Transdniestrian authorities time and again have undermined these initiatives by introducing illegal customs taxes  impeding the elections process in the villages situated on the left bank of the Dniester River  and confiscating school premises  gravely violating the right of the   25 09-53165  Moldovan citizens to study in their native language. The implementation of democratic reforms and the normalization of the economic and social climate on the right side of the Dniester will accelerate the resolution of the Transdniestrian problem.   The Republic of Moldova appreciates the activity of the EU Border Assistance Mission to Moldova and Ukraine and its close cooperation with the relevant border management bodies in both States. Its contribution to border security and transparency has created a more constructive atmosphere in which to seek a resolution of the Transdniestrian problem. The Republic of Moldova will further direct its efforts to resuming negotiations in the existing format in view of resolving the Transdniestrian problem. We count on the consistent support and political will of all mediators and observers in the resolution of this conflict.  Ongoing terrorist activities in various parts of the world demonstrate that terrorism continuously threatens the security  fundamental democratic values  human rights and the letter of the law that are the basis of the United Nations Charter. This scourge can be defeated only by firm  common action by the international community. In this context  we would like to reaffirm that the Republic of Moldova fully participates in the global fight against terrorism by implementing measures at the national level and by contributing to the international community’s efforts. The new Government of Moldova will take concrete action in combating international terrorism in accordance with international instruments  pertinent resolutions of the Security Council and relevant national documents  such as our national strategy for preventing and combating money-laundering and the financing of terrorism.   In compliance with the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy (see resolution 60/288)  the Republic of Moldova will further contribute to future United Nations efforts at consolidating international legislation to combat terrorism  especially in view of finalizing the negotiations of the comprehensive convention on international terrorism and organizing a high-level conference on terrorism under United Nations auspices. We believe that special attention needs to be paid to fighting those aspects of terrorism that are nourished by separatist tendencies that affect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States.  Climate change poses a grave challenge to the international community. Global warming and its related effects  including natural disasters  have become major threats to our peoples and to international security. Its consequences greatly affect vulnerable States  compromising economic growth and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. International cooperation is essential to dealing with the obvious threat of climate change. We have to raise alarm concerning the urgent need to strengthen regional and global cooperation and to enhance the assistance of donor States to developing countries and to countries with economies in transition.   In recent years  the Republic of Moldova has been confronted with considerable natural calamities  from acute droughts to severe floods. Each year  the intensity and frequency of these phenomena increase. The harm caused to the population  to the agricultural and food sectors  as well as to the overall national economy is huge. In this respect  the implementation of the United Nations Conventions addressing climate change and desertification and the development of an international strategy for disaster reduction are of increasing urgency for countries severely affected by droughts and desertification.   The Republic of Moldova recognizes the importance of environmental protection to ensuring the sustainable development of the country  as well as the need for this issue to inform all national policies. In this connection  we welcome the outcome of last week’s Summit on Climate Change and strongly support the continuation of negotiations. We hope that we will conclude the forthcoming Copenhagen Conference with a new far-reaching document. We praise the Secretary-General’s efforts in mobilizing the political will needed for the adoption of a new  equitable and ambitious agreement.   The Republic of Moldova strongly supports the activity of the High-Level Task Force on the Global Food Security Crisis set up and led by the Secretary-General. The efficient collaboration between the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations  the Bretton Woods institutions and other relevant United Nations structures  aimed at mobilizing new funds in order to overcome the global food crisis  will significantly contribute to the achievement of a comprehensive action plan on food security. We support the convening of the World Summit on Food Security in Rome in November this year.    09-53165 26   The Republic of Moldova is firm in its path towards European integration and committed to the universal values of peace  democracy  respect for human rights  the rule of law and economic freedom. European integration constitutes the major strategic goal of Moldova’s foreign and internal policies. We welcome positive developments in our relations with the European Union and their progress over the past few years  particularly after the victory of the Alliance for European Integration in the parliamentary elections held on 29 July 2009.   The new Government will firmly pursue the goal of rehabilitating the image of the Republic of Moldova in the international arena and will negotiate in the near future a new association agreement with the European Union. The leaders of the Alliance for European Integration are firmly committed to an efficient reform of the socio-economic system in the Republic of Moldova  without which the advancement of the country towards progress and prosperity is hardly possible. Those commitments represent eloquent proof of the positive evolution of the political situation in the Republic of Moldova after the recent parliamentary elections. The democratic process has been resumed.   The new Parliament has accepted the responsibility of complying with all the recommendations formulated by the European Parliament and the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe with regard to the events of 7 April. Those recommendations call for Moldova to improve its electoral legislation and to initiate the process of direct application of EU legislation. From this perspective  we count on the support and opportunities offered by the United Nations and its Member States to promote Moldova’s political and social economic objectives  its aspirations to European integration  the resolution of the Transdniestrian problem and the withdrawal of foreign troops.  In conclusion  I would like to confirm the adherence of the Republic of Moldova to the ideals of the United Nations and the will to further cooperate through concrete action with a view to accomplishing the commitments assumed. While respecting the diversity of views  cultures and religions of everyone  we must also be united in reaching for a common goal — protecting humanity and preserving human dignity as a foremost universal value."
"110",4459,"MDG",64,2009," It is with great pleasure that I speak from the rostrum of the United Nations today representing Madagascar  for which it is a particular honour to be able to contribute to the reflections and deliberations in this highly significant setting.  As we all know  the United Nations is the ideal forum for exchanging our respective experiences and to maintain our solidarity.  In such circumstances  allow me first of all to express my heartfelt thanks to Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann for the excellent way in which he led the sixty-third session of our General Assembly  which allowed us to make progress on various current issues that are necessary and useful for the fulfilment of humanity as a whole.  Allow me  furthermore  to present my warm congratulations on the election of Ali Treki as President of the sixty-fourth session of the General Assembly. I am certain that this august Assembly will adopt pertinent resolutions and decisions under his clear-sighted leadership.  I also wish to salute you  Mr. Secretary-General  for your exceptional and visible ability to react in response to all the crises troubling the world. I can only wish you the greatest success in accomplishing your missions.  This year’s theme  “global response to global crises and development through strengthening multilateralism and dialogue of civilizations” perfectly reflects the desire of us all to find a common solution to our common problems.  Our cultural  religious or other differences should in no way constitute a factor in lack of understanding among us  the peoples of this world.  On the contrary  they should provide even greater impetus to guide us towards durable peace and security.  Indeed  our differences lie in the way in which each of us approaches realities  being and events. The resulting points of view are partial  and thus necessarily complement each other.  I join with African leaders in affirming that Africa deserves its place in the community of nations. I also share the view that the common value of democracy we all proclaim would be meaningless if geographical representation were not applied within this Organization. It is a matter of the very legitimacy of the United Nations.  As the world’s second most populous continent  Africa should not be excluded from initiatives that concern it. A/64/470   09-53756 4   We support the demand of the President of the African Union and several member States to grant it the right to a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council with all the associated prerogatives.  We are here to mark the way for future generations and to make concrete our desire to promote dialogue among cultures and civilizations. Let us hold fast to the principles we unanimously adopted in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that “All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.”  Allow me to salute all the efforts undertaken to date  at all levels of our international community  for this cause that is dear to us. Nevertheless  much remains to be done  for we are still far from achieving our objectives.  Understanding  rejection of discrimination  and tolerance  religious or otherwise  without which a durable peace will remain a utopian ideal  must be the watchwords in guiding our actions.  They must be our reference points in each decision we take  whether in the political  economic  social or cultural fields.  In that regard  allow me briefly to examine the case of my country  Madagascar  whose situation  it appears to me  embodies a model of society where “we”  the youth  must take on an increasingly important role in all decision-making processes.  Sixty-five per cent of the population of Madagascar is under 25 years of age  which is roughly the proportion of youth throughout the world  especially in developing countries.  The world is in the process of searching for a reference point to survive the major challenges it is facing  in particular the economic and financial crisis  climate change  food insecurity and growing poverty.  In Madagascar  these problems  combined with failed governance over the past two decades  inevitably resulted in an acute political and social crisis.  The Malagasy experience speaks to us all  for the youth of Madagascar have taken responsibility.  Being among the youngest Heads of State present at this General Assembly  if not the youngest  I formally call on all the youth of the world to take action against the new challenges facing humanity.  “Let us act in order not to suffer  and change for a better  sustainable world!”  I also appeal to our elders to have confidence in the youth of today and of tomorrow. And I thank the Secretary-General for the relevance of his initiative at his climate change conference  when he involved youth in this struggle for the survival of humanity.  We are speaking out to the whole world because:  We have waited too long for our opportunity to choose;  We have waited too long to attack injustice  the poverty of our countrymen  abuse and drift;  A/64/470 5 09-53756   We have waited too long to find real solutions to poor governance which has mired much of humanity in poverty.  To suffering  anguish and despair  we must have one response:  We want to change   We must change   We will change.  This is not the first time in 49 years of independence that the Malagasy people have manifested their will for change.  The peaceful movement of the Malagasy people led to the establishment of a Transitional Authority validated by the High Constitutional Court of the Republic of Madagascar.  Unfortunately  some technical and financial partners are threatening sanctions of various types.  We can only regret such threats  which will serve only to increase the suffering of the Malagasy people  for Madagascar still depends on international assistance  and in the end its beneficiaries are the people and not Governments.  Therefore  from this rostrum  we solemnly appeal to the international community  to all donors  to review their reading of the situation and to continue their assistance to the Malagasy people in order to prevent further deterioration in their standard of living.  The principal mission of the transition regime  which is consensual and inclusive  is to draft a new Constitution for the advent of the Fourth Republic in line with the expectations of the Malagasy people. The major principles of this new Constitution will be laid down during a national conference to be organized and conducted by civil society.  We would like to state our commitment to the holding of free  fair  transparent and regular elections as early as possible  on the basis of a new electoral code under the supervision of the Independent Electoral Commission and monitored by international observers.  We greatly hope that the United Nations will accompany us through this electoral process. We request your assistance and support.  Looking towards the International Year for the Rapprochement of Cultures in 2010  the Malagasy people call for international cooperation in favour of all initiatives aimed at promoting a culture of peace and dialogue among all cultures  civilizations and religions. This choice is eminently meaningful as the current crises remind us that all countries of the world are called on to cooperate  especially because of interdependence related to globalization  and that a spirit of dialogue must prevail.  Dialogue assumes equality and mutual respect. Thus  all points of view and proposed solutions deserve to be considered for their worth in order to address the complex crises which are currently raging across our planet. In other words  effective multilateralism through international organizations is at stake  and ideological eclecticism as well as methodological realism must be brought to bear. A/64/470   09-53756 6   Dialogue also requires a spirit of burden-sharing. From this viewpoint  since crises have universal impact  recovery should benefit all and associated strategies must be impartial.  As long as some peoples and actors of the world are underestimated and even excluded  effectiveness will miss the mark.  The promises made at the international conferences on the economic  financial  food and climate crises must be kept. Among them  I would like to cite the promise to allocate 0.7 per cent of the economic recovery plans adopted in rich countries to respond to the immediate needs of peoples suffering from hunger and malnutrition and to guarantee food security for all.  Madagascar is grateful for the support of the international community in its efforts for peace and development  and reaffirms its determination to contribute to our collective reflections in order to solve shared problems.  May the dialogue of civilizations prosper all the nations through a gentler  more humane globalization!  "
"111",4498,"MDV",64,2009,"I should like to begin by extending to His Excellency Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki my delegation’s warmest congratulations on his election to preside over the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. I assure him of the full support and cooperation of my delegation. I also take this opportunity to express our most profound appreciation to his predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann  for the exemplary manner in which he guided our work at the sixty-third session.  I should also like to record my delegation’s heartfelt gratitude to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his inspiring leadership and dedication in promoting the noble principles and ideals of this Organization.  This is the first time the General Assembly has been addressed by a democratically elected President of the Maldives. I am extremely pleased to be here. I have spent many of the past General Assembly sessions locked in a hot  humid  damp cell with my hands shackled and my feet bound  imprisoned for my conviction that the 300 000 people of the Maldives should be free from fear  free from want and free to live their lives in liberty and in dignity.  I would like to thank the international community for its invaluable support in securing our democratic transition. Reformers in the Maldives and our friends in the United Nations should feel justifiably proud that our island home was able to mark last year’s first International Day of Democracy in the best possible way: by throwing off a 30-year-old autocracy and securing a smooth  peaceful and democratic transfer of power.  Just as the international community played a key role in securing the Maldives’ democratic transition  so  I hope  will it play a role in the even more difficult task of making sure our democracy becomes a permanent feature rather than a passing illusion. All of us who care about the Maldives and believe in democracy bear an enormous responsibility to ensure that the beliefs we fought for are set in stone rather than written in sand.  There are three areas in which the Maldives seeks the help of the international community. The first is continued collaboration in democracy-building. We must work together to strengthen the various pillars of a democratic society  namely protection of human rights  good governance  independent oversight bodies  a free press and civil society. The Maldives has made enormous progress on all of those pillars  but much remains to be done. My sense is that the necessary foundations are now in place. The separation of powers    09-52425 34  has been established by constitutional reform. A range of independent agencies and commissions have now been set up. We have a thriving independent media. Nevertheless  several crucial challenges still remain  and we look forward to the support of the international community as we move to meet these challenges. In particular  I would like to stress the importance of ensuring the equality of women and men  not just in name  but in practice.  The second way in which the international community can help consolidate democracy and the rule of law in the Maldives is by promoting a conducive economic environment. As a small  open market economy that is heavily dependent on tourism and fishery exports  the Maldives has suffered badly from the current global recession. Moreover  since assuming office  we have come to understand that  in the run-up to last year’s election  the former regime engaged in highly irresponsible economic policies in the hope of buying their way to victory. Add to this picture our continued efforts to recovery from the 2004 tsunami  our impending graduation from the least developed country category and the high oil and food prices of recent years  and the scale of the economic challenge facing the new Government becomes very apparent.  The new Government is determined to confront this challenge with honesty and with vigour. In consultation with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank  we have embarked on a programme of major economic reform designed to reduce the bloated public sector  privatize public utilities and promote private enterprise and trade. Yet the scale of the problems we face means we cannot succeed on our own. We therefore look to our friends in the international community to help us get back on our feet. We are very grateful for the support extended to us by the IMF and the Indian Government  to name but two of our partners. However  more is needed if democracy and human rights are to coexist with economic stability and prosperity.  The third way in which the international community can and must help the Maldives consolidate democracy and establish a secure  prosperous and equitable society is by taking urgent and effective action to tackle climate change. The threats posed to the Maldives from climate change are well known. Every beach lost to rising seas  every house lost to storm surges  every reef lost to increasingly warm waters  every job lost as fish stocks dwindle and every life lost to more frequent extreme weather events will make it harder and harder to govern the country  until a point is reached when we must consider abandoning our homeland.  I therefore call on you  the leaders of the world  to protect the future of frontline countries like the Maldives by reaching an ambitious and effective agreement at December’s United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) conference in Copenhagen which seeks to limit average global temperature increases to less than 1.5 centigrade degrees above pre-industrial levels. To do otherwise would be to sign a death warrant for the 300 000 Maldivians.   But the Maldives is determined to do what we can to survive. We are going to be the first country to go carbon neutral  in 10 years’ time. In order to do that  we are determined to formulate a survival kit: a carbon-neutral manual that would enable others to replicate our actions  in order that all of us together might just about save ourselves from climate catastrophe.  As part of our efforts to achieve a unified voice  I will be inviting some of the most vulnerable States affected by climate change to the Maldives. We hope that that November summit will reinforce our determination to leave no stone unturned to ensure our survival.   I should now like to touch on a number of other important issues which are of enormous concern to us. The Maldives abhors terrorism in all its forms and is determined to stand shoulder to shoulder with all countries in facing down this menace. Events over the past year in Afghanistan  Pakistan and India  our neighbours and partners in South Asia  show us that victory in this fight will not be easy to achieve. They also show us that to effectively tackle terrorism we must reaffirm and not dilute our commitments to human rights  democracy  the rule of law and good governance.  While we applaud recent efforts to reform and revitalize the United Nations  we believe that such reforms cannot be successful or complete without the much-anticipated and much-needed reform of the Security Council. We strongly believe that the third round of intergovernmental negotiations on Security Council reform must produce tangible results. I call   35 09-52425  upon the Assembly to complete this task during the sixty-fourth session and come to agreement on increases in both the permanent and non-permanent membership of the Council. In terms of composition  we believe that the geo-political realities of the contemporary world must be duly reflected in the membership of the Council. Therefore  we support the inclusion of India and Japan as permanent members.  The new Government of Maldives is determined to pursue friendly and mutually respectful relations with every country represented in this Hall. However  any friendship must include a willingness to be frank with one another and to object to behaviour not befitting a sovereign State.  We believe dialogue and constructive engagement serve the cause of peace better than ostracism and isolation. The new Government in Maldives will look to renew relations with Israel and to use the relationship to reiterate our support for an independent and sovereign Palestinian homeland  in conformity with the relevant resolutions of the Security Council.  Maldives is seeking election to the Human Rights Council during the current session of the General Assembly because we firmly believe in the universality of human rights and their critical importance to achieving the noble goals of the United Nations Charter.  Standing at this rostrum  I must admit how  as a prisoner  I was inspired by the courage and vision of Aung San Suu Kyi of Burma. Today I would like to echo the call of the Secretary-General for her immediate and unconditional release along with all other political prisoners. I also reiterate my strident support for the work assigned to Mr. Ibrahim Gambari  the United Nations Special Envoy to Burma  and say a prayer for political prisoners everywhere.  In conclusion  I must say that the most critical test so far of the resoluteness of the international community to save itself will come during Mr. Treki’s watch as President of this Assembly: the Copenhagen meeting in December. We must prime ourselves to succeed at that conference. Between now and then  we must all use every opportunity  every debate  and every encounter to achieve that goal. It is imperative that we succeed. If we want to save the world  I suggest that saving Maldives is a very good starting point."
"112",4545,"MEX",64,2009,"Since the last session of the General   11 09-52598  Assembly  a number of crises have tested the capabilities of multilateral institutions to face them firmly and with unified purpose. The international community has come to understand that only joint action in which developing countries are full participants can offer sustainable responses to these emergencies. Fortunately  we see some positive signs of economic growth in some places.  Nevertheless  insecurity and uncertainty prevail. The insecurity results from the persistence of armed conflicts  terrorism and transnational organized crime  which threaten our achievements in sustainable human development. The uncertainty is linked to the negotiations that will lead to the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen in December. Global warming is now a threat to humanity of incalculable proportions  to which we all contribute and for which we all  without exception  are responsible.  Contributing to sustainable human development requires  first  conditions conducive to international peace and security. As President Felipe Calderón pointed out in the Security Council summit (see S/PV.6191)  nuclear proliferation and highly insufficient legal access to peaceful uses for atomic energy demand a renewed commitment to disarmament and the strengthening of the non-proliferation regime.  I also echo the emphatic call  issued by global civil society at the sixty-second Annual Conference of the Department of Public Information for Non-Governmental Organizations  held in Mexico City this year  that we  the Governments of the world  fulfil our responsibilities to attain our goal of a world free of nuclear weapons.  The promotion and protection of human rights constitute a universal ethical imperative and an obligation that no government can renounce. The progress attained in this field at the national level has been possible thanks to my country’s close alignment with the international system for the promotion and protection of human rights  which has proved an invaluable tool for promoting improvements in our national structures.  It is clear that to attain full sustainable human development we must tackle poverty and inequality  fostering a development that ensures access for all people to adequate food  health  education and housing.  In response to the health emergency that Mexico faced some months ago with the outbreak of influenza A(H1N1)  the World Health Organization gave its full support to the timely  energetic and responsible actions of my Government. This is proof that the United Nations system is capable of mobilizing coordinated action by States and avoiding unilateral measures that are not appropriate in response to such emergencies. We must continue to update our protocols for action.  For Mexico  meeting the Millennium Development Goals is a State commitment. Our priority continues to be the eradication of poverty. We must make the necessary structural changes to reduce inequality and attain prosperity for all. We must implement policies that ensure that concrete action is taken based on the Monterrey Consensus on financing for development  that the Doha Round is successfully concluded and that contributions by developed countries and multilateral development banks to projects in countries with low growth rates are increased.  It is imperative to address urgent needs such as food security in order to reduce inequality and strengthen the capacities enjoyed by our peoples. Food security is the very foundation of development. Therefore  we must ensure food security by eliminating market distortions  boosting production through the use of technology and improving productivity without making sacrifices on the environmental agenda.  The recent Group of 20 Summit in Pittsburgh demonstrated that the scale of the global financial crisis requires a firm response  both in coordinating the measures taken by individual countries to mitigate impact in areas such as unemployment and in avoiding protectionist measures. There is still much left to do  but it is a fact that the timely intervention by the Group of 20 allowed further resources to be channelled to the international financial institutions and strengthened the participation of developing countries in the decision-making bodies within those institutions.  The United Nations must realize that we are witnessing a reconfiguration of global economic governance  and that policies must be adjusted to this new reality. We require an Organization that is strong  effective and efficient. The cuts that are being imposed on all countries at home must also be reflected in United Nations system budgets. If it remains passive  alienated and conformist  our Organization risks losing    09-52598 12  its relevance as the premier universal and legitimate forum for solving the major problems of humanity.  The challenges of global warming have made it clear that the absence of economic incentives is one of the main reasons that the commitments under the Kyoto Protocol and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change have not been fulfilled. For this reason  Mexico has proposed  in the preparatory negotiations for the Copenhagen Conference  an innovative financing scheme  known as the Green Fund  which would reward the efforts of States that adopt policies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions  without jeopardizing their development goals. The Green Fund fully responds to the principle of common but differentiated responsibility. It is not just another financial mechanism that obeys the conventional criteria.  All countries must be able to receive financing  but the scale of the contributions will result from a combination of factors that take into account  among other things  their level of development  the size of their population and the volume of their emissions. Least-developed countries will not be obliged to contribute. This initiative of President Felipe Calderón has received growing support from Member States  which reinforces the will of my Government to continue moving forward with all parties in the negotiations prior to Copenhagen.  The negotiations aimed at achieving comprehensive Security Council reform have made significant progress through a process that has heard debate on all aspects of reform and identified proposals that can garner the broadest possible consensus. We must continue negotiations towards compromise solutions which would increase the representative nature of the Council and translate into greater accountability  without jeopardizing its effectiveness.  The world has undoubtedly changed since 1945  and remains in a state of permanent mutation  as the ongoing discussions on the international economic and financial architecture demonstrate. It is absurd to argue for static institutions in a world that is anything but static.  As we presented our candidacy as a non-permanent member of the Security Council for the 2009-2010 term  Mexico announced that it would seek to foster closer communications between Member States and the Security Council  something which is essential if the Council is to accomplish its tasks. As President of the Council during the month of April  Mexico made progress in increasing the transparency of that body by issuing information on a significant number of the Council’s consultations. We will keep working to enhance the effectiveness and legitimacy of the Council in several ways. First  we will seek to strengthen the work of the Council in preventing international crises relating to massive human rights violations and strengthening protection for the thousands of internally displaced persons and refugees. Secondly  we will seek to focus the Council’s attention on preventing conflicts  and not just managing them  by incorporating in its resolutions mandates that link security with strengthened development aid and humanitarian assistance. Thirdly  we wish to make development assistance a fundamental strategy for conflict prevention and reconstruction.  The situation in Honduras has made evident the importance of continuing to improve our means in preventing actions that suspend democracy and the rule of law. We can celebrate the fact that the international community responded unanimously to the forceful interruption of constitutional order in Honduras and the ousting of President José Manuel Zelaya. Mexico  together with the majority of countries of the hemisphere  has acted within regional mechanisms  including the Rio Group  which we chair  to secure President Zelaya’s return to office and that democratic order is restored based on the initiative of President Arias of Costa Rica. We issue an emphatic call to the de facto authorities to continue the dialogue with the commission established under the auspices of the Organization of American States  to abstain from any act that would endanger the inviolability of the Embassy of Brazil  where President Zelaya is located and to respect his physical safety and that of those who are with him.  Let us work together for a world that is more secure and more just  a world where in the words of the great Octavio Paz  liberty can take root — a prosperous world anchored by the rights and freedoms of individuals."
"113",4570,"MHL",64,2009,"I bring the greetings and best wishes of the people of the Republic of the Marshall Islands. I congratulate the President on his election to chair the Assembly at this session. He has our confidence and support.   I offer my gratitude to the United Nations for its continuing role in coordinating and leading the world’s efforts to meet challenges affecting the interests of all nations. The United Nations Joint Presence Office in the Marshall Islands has brought the ideals of the Organization closer to our people and country. Our hope is that other United Nations agencies — including the World Health Organization  the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM)  the Food and Agriculture Organization and the United Nations   51 09-52425  Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific — will follow suit and make their presence felt more prominently  producing concrete results on the ground.  I wish to acknowledge the personal commitment of the Secretary-General to meeting the challenges of climate change. His reminder to take our best to the table in Copenhagen in service of a higher calling to save the planet is well noted. His call for a clear moral imperative for bold and decisive urgent action and his recognition of the duty of the larger economies to the most vulnerable have not gone unnoticed by us small island States. Although some may consider as insufficient the Group of 8 commitment in Italy this year  I believe it is an encouraging and a necessary step forward.  We cherish the hope that the increasing participation of the United States in debates on issues relating to climate change is a signal of its intention to take its rightful place at the forefront of the global war against climate change. Likewise  we are encouraged by Japan’s bold and new commitment to address the adverse effects of climate change.  Let me express my appreciation to the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) for its leadership in assisting small island developing countries to prepare for negotiations in Copenhagen. We assure AOSIS of our unwavering support.  Full of expectation  the world has its eyes on Copenhagen. It will be an event of historic significance where  despite our differences  everyone can now view the entire planet through a common perspective.  Now  a few weeks away from Copenhagen  I feel moved to ask what it is that we want to see happening in there. What kind of outcome do we expect? How should we and future generations judge the success of Copenhagen?  The answer  it seems to me  is a matter of perspective. Major economies will no doubt be watchful that Copenhagen does not disturb too much an established way of life and all its benefits. I ask these nations to consider the implicit moral obligation that comes with their privileged and affluent status.  For the small island States  however  the question is whether Copenhagen will diminish or enhance their security and their chances of survival  whether the populations of the Marshall Islands  Tuvalu  Tokelau and others should make haste to evacuate and head to safer regions  as foreshadowed in a recent warning from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.  Therefore  our message to the leaders in Copenhagen is clear: we appeal to them to strive with every fibre of their being to increase their level of commitment to combating climate change  to show the world by their deeds — not words — their unbending commitment to secure an effective post-Kyoto global agreement. We appeal to them to be as unrestrained as the wind and set the limit on the increase in global average temperature above the pre-industrial period at a level that will ensure our survival. We appeal to them to be fair-minded and to act with determination to reduce global emissions from 1990 levels by at least 85 per cent by 2050. We appeal to them to ensure that global emissions peak no later than 2015. Finally  we appeal to the leaders of all nations to construct in Copenhagen the ark of salvation in which all nations and peoples will find shelter.  I believe that the success of Copenhagen will be ultimately judged by the extent to which small  low-lying island States — the most vulnerable — will feel a sense of guaranteed safety and security. For  in our interdependent global community  the moral duty of the collective must always be the protection of the weak and the most vulnerable.  Short of that  however  Copenhagen will be no more than the continuation of the law of the jungle  the survival of the strongest. It will be a moral and political failure. For Copenhagen is not about mathematics. It is not about raw power; it is not competition for the survival of the few. It is about unleashing the moral and political forces and synergies inherent in the collective body of nations for the good of all. What else does political will mean but this?  Failure in Copenhagen will make a mockery of the Millennium Development Goals  for their achievement will be beyond our capacity to attain. It will question the ability of the Charter of the United Nations to safeguard our pre-existing sovereign rights. In short  the world and the most vulnerable in it cannot afford the cost of failure.   Closer to home  even though the rate of emission of the Marshall Islands is insignificant in relative terms  we have set for ourselves a reduction target of 40 per cent by 2020. Over the years  and subject to    09-52425 52  accessibility of funding  we have been pursuing a systematic programme of solar power use. Nearly 40 per cent of the households in our outer islands are now drawing on that power as one of their main sources of energy. We intend to pursue this initiative until all 33 islands in our country are fully covered. On the Micronesian subregional front  we are committed to the goals of the Micronesia Challenge.  Our efforts to adapt continue to suffer from the lack of adequate funding  compounded by the sheer complexity in accessing it from the sources. Simplifying the process by direct access to those sources could enable us to fast-track some of our adaptation priorities  such as seawalls  coastal management and safe water projects.  I now turn to a matter that is very dear to the heart of every Marshallese. We are deeply encouraged by the Security Council meeting today  moderated by President Obama  on the use and testing of nuclear weapons.   Nuclear weapon testing was conducted on our islands between 1946 and 1958  at the time when we were a ward of the United Nations trusteeship system. Our first-hand experience as victims of nuclear weapon testing on our islands  and the painful memories that continue to haunt us after six decades  are nightmares we would not wish on anyone. The toll in human suffering and environmental damage has been devastating. Now  sixty years since the detonation of some 67 nuclear bombs  the Marshall Islands is still grappling with the after-effects. Complete recovery in terms of restoring affected islands to full economic productivity and adequate compensation of the victims remains uncertain.  We have not come here to condemn or to point fingers. However  we are compelled by our moral duty to humanity to raise our voice in gatherings such as this and to appeal to the conscience of the world community. We call for the formulation of a new perspective by which the spectre of war and of the use of nuclear weapons may forever be dismissed from the surface of the Earth.   Banning nuclear weapons will not by itself remove the root cause of war. Important as it may be  it does not exert an enduring influence. People are too ingenious not to invent still other forms of warfare. Political agreements or good intentions alone are not enough. The world craves something much more deep-seated than pure pragmatism. It yearns for permanent peace that springs from an inner state supported by a moral attitude.  There is no lack of recognition by national leaders of the nature of the problem  but there is a paralysis of will. The stark realities of the experience of the people of the Marshall Islands have deepened our profound conviction that  in a world irreversibly moving towards a global society  it becomes imperative that we recast our perspective  a perspective in which national impulses and interests will find their fullest expression when subordinated to the needs and interests of the planet  our collective homeland  a perspective that does not regard that subordination as being disloyal to the nation.  Amid our deepening economic and financial woes  the Republic of the Marshall Islands continues to remain buoyant through the generous support of our friends and partners. Our special relationship with the United States within the framework of the Compact of Free Association provides a unique partnership that is enduring and stable.  We express our firm support for the efforts of the United States and its allies in combating terrorism  and we are proud of our young Marshallese men and women serving in the armed forces of the United States. The support also provided by Japan  the Republic of China (Taiwan)  the European Union  Australia and our other donor partners is sincerely acknowledged.  The increasing complexity of the management of evolving global affairs demands a reconstitution of the membership of the Security Council. Japan’s distinguished leadership and achievements in the area of human security match its aspirations to seek a permanent seat on the Council and thus deserve favourable consideration. Evidence of progress in the confidence-building process between China and the Republic of China (Taiwan) deserves praise and encouragement from the international community. Taiwan’s membership in the United Nations specialized agencies will enable its 23 million people to play an active part in the affairs of the family of nations.  Not a single nation can escape the powerful grip of the challenges of climate change. Its deadly virus is here already. The remedy is clear: collective and resolute action  now more than ever. The choice is   53 09-52425  ours. We implore Almighty God to give us courage and wisdom. "
"114",4594,"MKD",64,2009,"I have the special honour and privilege today to address this esteemed forum and to share with you the views of the Republic of Macedonia regarding the topics of this session  but also on other current issues that concern us all  directly or indirectly.  At the outset  I would like to convey my congratulations and to greet the President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session  Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki. I would also like to extend to him our full readiness for cooperation in the course of his mandate. At the same time  I wish to congratulate the President of the Assembly at its sixty-third session  Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann  for his successful presidency. Availing myself of this opportunity  I would like to acknowledge the engagements and the efforts of the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  which indisputably have contributed to the enhancement of the role and reputation of the Organization.  Before I refer to the key theme of this session  I would like to remind the Assembly of the fear and uncertainty we all felt exactly one year ago  right here. It was fear and uncertainty over the scope and the consequences of the global financial and economic crisis. I recall this in order to emphasize the urgent need for the United Nations to use this opportunity to contribute to processes that will facilitate the overcoming of the effects of the crisis. It is even more important that we assist in preventing new such crises. In this context the serious economic problems most of us have been facing should not shift our focus from the absolute priority  which is the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals.  The issue of climate change  which today represents one of the biggest challenges facing humanity  is extremely high on our national agenda  but also on that of the United Nations. We owe it to our children and to the generations to come to preserve our planet. If we do not establish  urgently and immediately  the highest and most sustainable standards for how we treat the environment  we will pay the price in the future. Time is running out  and there is no possibility for us to further postpone   21 09-52463  coordinated and serious measures to combat the negative consequences of climate change. Climate change and global warming have an increasingly serious impact on economic growth and on the quality  quantity and price of food. That exacerbates poverty. It is therefore imperative that we tackle this issue immediately.   The Republic of Macedonia  as a party to the Framework Convention on Climate Change for more than a decade now  has been actively working on implementing the goals set out in the Convention. We have — including me personally — assigned special significance to the forthcoming United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen  and we all have great expectations for it. The Macedonian authorities are truly committed to undertaking numerous concrete activities with a view to raising awareness in society regarding this issue. The Republic of Macedonia is fully prepared to make its contribution to the global effort.  When we address issues related to peacekeeping and stability  a large majority of us  unfortunately  regularly expresses dissatisfaction regarding the current state of affairs. Peace and security are compromised on a daily basis in certain regions of the world. We are faced with the continuation of old and frozen conflicts  but also with a series of new tensions in many regions throughout the world.  When it comes to the reasons for the constant crises besetting our world  or certain parts of it  allow me to seize this opportunity to quote Martin Luther King  who in 1967 uttered a recipe for overcoming bilateral  regional and global crises. He said:   “Let us be dissatisfied until from every city hall  justice will roll down like waters  and righteousness like a mighty stream. Let us be dissatisfied until that day when the lion and the lamb shall lie down together  and every man will sit under his own vine and fig tree  and none shall be afraid.”  With reference to these words  I welcome the topic of this session  which is meant to assist us in finding effective responses to global crises. The responses to most questions must take into consideration not only the present and the reality of today’s world  but on top of that  we must anticipate the future and take on board the objectives we have set ourselves.  Instead of paying lip service to multilateralism  which I do not believe will help  a real approach based on meaningful multilateralism and action is required. The Republic of Macedonia and I personally strongly believe in and strive towards effective multilateralism. We believe that strengthening multilateralism is the only way to advance towards and achieve our primary goals of peace  democracy  human freedoms and rights and respect of international law and principles.  The Republic of Macedonia strongly supports joint efforts to improve the overall coherence of the United Nations system. We need a United Nations that will  in the best possible and most efficient manner  realize the expectations and the objectives of its Member States.  The Republic of Macedonia is a country that has immense experience in nurturing and affirming dialogue and in advancing dialogue among civilizations. It is a unique example of a successful multi-ethnic and multi-faith country.  The summit on Dialogue Among Civilizations that was held in the Republic of Macedonia  in Ohrid in 2003  with assistance and support from the United Nations  is an example of the kind of regular annual meetings at the highest level that are being held in South-East Europe under the auspices of UNESCO. This not only represents recognition for my country but also demonstrates the value of dialogue in the advancement of security and in development.  Since its independence  the Republic of Macedonia has been unswervingly committed to the promotion of democracy and the improvement of the living standards of its people  and to reform in all spheres of our economy. The Republic of Macedonia promotes a society founded upon the rule of law  respect for human rights  multi-ethnic cohabitation  dialogue and mutual understanding.   Over the past number of years  the Republic of Macedonia has achieved impressive progress that has been recognized and acknowledged by all. My country today is looking forward to the initiation of the accession negotiations with the European Union. My country has fulfilled all of the conditions set for NATO membership. It is an active and strong supporter of regional cooperation. It remains fully committed to good-neighbourly relations and to dialogue as a key tool for overcoming all of the issues that continue to beset the region.    09-52463 22   All of my country’s Governments have consistently focused on the realization of the country’s two top strategic priorities: accession to the European Union and accession to NATO. The Republic of Macedonia is dedicated to sharing and contributing to the Euro-Atlantic values in a common vision for the enlargement of the stability and security zone in South-East Europe.   The actions of our southern neighbour that prevented the Republic of Macedonia from acceding to the NATO alliance were contrary to the obligations undertaken in the 1995 interim agreement. That was done in an attempt to influence the outcome of the negotiations held under the auspices of the United Nations and was completely opposite to the common vision. Nevertheless  I would like to stress before this forum that the Republic of Macedonia is sincerely dedicated to the process of resolving our differences with our southern neighbour within the framework of the mechanism set out in United Nations resolutions.   The Republic of Macedonia believes in law and in justice. The Republic of Macedonia believes in the International Court of Justice as a body of the United Nations and as a protector and upholder of the law. Beyond the absurdity of the dispute with our southern neighbour  the Republic of Macedonia sincerely hopes that soon the only obstacle that prevents us from taking our rightful place in the Euro-Atlantic family will be removed.   In spite of the flagrant violation of international obligations by our southern neighbour — in respect whereof the Republic of Macedonia has filed an appeal at the International Court of Justice — we are actively participating in the negotiation process with the Republic of Greece. I would like to state clearly that we are prepared to discuss only the issues foreseen in the United Nations resolutions. The Republic of Macedonia is prepared to seek a solution that is a reasonable and fair compromise and that will not touch upon or deny our national  cultural or linguistic identity in any way  a solution that would obtain the legitimacy and the seal of approval of our citizens. There is no more sovereign right than the right of self-determination and self-identification. That right has been cherished by many generations before us.  I hope that the Republic of Greece will abandon its policy of taking action from a position of power in order to unfavourably influence the outcome of the disputed issue. I expect that the political leadership will look towards the wider interest in terms of permanent stabilization of the entire region. We believe that with truthful and sincere willingness and preparedness we can reach a solution whereby there will be neither winners nor losers.  Allow me to take this opportunity to recall Article 1  paragraph 2 of the Charter of the United Nations:   “[t]o develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples  and to take other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace”.  Let not this Organization betray the expectations of the vast majority of people who set their hope on it  and let it not betray the ideals of its founders. The Organization must prepare itself to come up with responses to existing and emerging challenges posed by our times. When I say “the Organization”  I refer to all of us who support those processes. The Republic of Macedonia sees in the Organization the potential to maintain stability in international affairs and a unique opportunity to tackle the numerous challenges posed to humanity. The Republic of Macedonia  as has been the case hitherto  shall continue to respect and support the values and principles enshrined in the Charter.  Allow me to finish my address with the words of the former Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan  who said that if the goal of humanity is progress in peace and freedom  the state of peace is not only a state free of conflict  it is a state of respecting human freedom and rights. We are still far from that goal. However  indisputably  huge and serious progress has been achieved."
"115",4638,"MLI",64,2009,"At the outset  Sir  it is a pleasure for Mali to congratulate you on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session and on your outstanding management of our work. The trust placed in you does honour to the whole of Africa and is a brilliant tribute to the great Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and its leader  whose commitment to African unity and just causes is acknowledged by all. I assure you of our full support in your new responsibilities and congratulate your predecessor  Father Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann of Nicaragua  on his excellent work throughout his mandate.  I also congratulate Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on his strenuous efforts to strengthen the role of our Organization  and reaffirm our desire for his success in his assigned missions.   The current general debate is a timely opportunity for us to consider together the urgent problems facing the international community  to share our worries and concerns about the challenges that affect the world  and to find sustainable solutions pursuant to the heartfelt aspirations of our peoples.   While the financial and economic crisis that burst onto the scene last year has spared no country  it undoubtedly weakened the economies of the developing countries  especially in Africa  a continent that has long been marginalized. Fluctuations in food and oil prices have decreased revenues and exacerbated inflation in many developing countries.  The current multifaceted crises in the realms of finance  food  energy and the environment have plunged hundreds of millions of people into poverty and aggravated circumstances already straitened by unemployment and the high cost of access to basic services. The plight of the most vulnerable strata of society in developing countries  especially women and children  calls for action by the international community and should be at the heart of international concerns.  Even as this year we celebrate the twentieth anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child  hundreds of millions of children still live at risk and in extreme poverty. More than 26 000 children under the age of five die each day in developing countries of diseases that for the most part could have been avoided if adequate resources had been mobilized and effective measures put in place to respond to immediate needs.   The breadth and complexity of the challenges that must be met cannot distract the international community from its responsibilities. It goes without saying that the resolution of the world financial and economic crisis requires a democratization of the international monetary system  notably the institution of a new international financial architecture based on the genuine participation of all nations  including developing countries. Only a global and cooperative effort will succeed in laying the groundwork for a lasting recovery. It is also essential to strengthen global development partnerships in order to create conditions favourable for the reduction of poverty  the improvement of health and education  gender equality and environmental protection  as set out in the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).  In this regard  the Government of Mali has launched an innovative project to focus the MDGs on the 166 Malian municipal districts most vulnerable to food shortages. That initiative  inspired by the Millennium Village approach  is part of the economic and social development project instituted by the President of the Republic  His Excellency Mr. Amadou Toumani Touré. The project’s principal aim is  “to assure robust and sustainable growth that produces opportunities and prosperity for all citizens; to open the way to the achievement of the MDGs by 2015  thus allowing all Malians to enjoy the fundamental rights of all human beings to have enough to eat  to have access to potable water  to enjoy basic services within a radius of five kilometres and to send their children  both boys and girls  to primary school; and to create good working conditions for the majority of the country’s young people”.  As part of that initiative  the Forum on Initiative 166  organized by the Malian Government in the   39 09-53165  margins of this session of the General Assembly  has increased awareness among development partners and donors alike of the need to support the efforts of the more than 2.5 million people living in nearly 3 000 villages in the 166 districts to raise themselves out of extreme poverty and launch their own social and economic development process.  Despite the progress made in developing countries with regard to the MDGs  the 2015 deadline looms on the horizon and much remains to do. We dare believe that the pledges made by the industrialized countries  notably at the Group of 20 summits held in Washington  D.C.  London and Pittsburgh  will be honoured.   We also urge donor nations  international financial institutions and development organizations to give full attention to the special circumstances of the group of landlocked developing nations. Given their lack of access to oceans  their isolation and their removal from international markets  those countries face great difficulties in their endeavours to ensure their economic growth and social well-being and to participate in the global economy and international commerce. We remain convinced that pushing forward the implementation of the Almaty Programme of Action for landlocked countries will greatly contribute to the realization of the goals identified.  Climate change remains one of the greatest challenges of the day. We welcome the Secretary-General’s initiative to convene a summit devoted exclusively to climate change and environmental degradation. We believe that the international community must intensify its efforts to reach an international accord at the Conference in Copenhagen this December.  The maintenance of international peace and security is a prerequisite for all development. That is why Mali remains firmly devoted to the ideals of peace and stability both inside and outside its borders. In that spirit and at the initiative of the President of Mali  a regional conference will shortly be convened in Bamako on peace  security and development in the Sahelo-Saharan region. Our most ardent wish is to transform that area into a haven of peace  stability and prosperity.  Mali welcomes the progress made in Africa in restoring peace  stability and post-conflict reconciliation under the auspices of the African Union and the United Nations. We reaffirm our active solidarity with the peoples of the Middle East and will continue to support the relevant United Nations resolutions on the Middle East and the Palestinian question.   International terrorism is yet another serious threat to international peace and security. Mali therefore firmly and unequivocally condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations  and applauds the General Assembly’s adoption of the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy (resolution 60/288)  as promoted by our heads of State and Government at the 2005 World Summit.  Today more than ever  our nations must coordinate their efforts to overcome together the great challenges faced by humanity. The strengthening of international cooperation demands greater solidarity. That is in the interest of us all  because humanity needs to harness all of its potential if it is to achieve harmonious and sustainable development in an environment of peace and security. "
"116",4681,"MLT",64,2009,"I would like to congratulate Mr. Ali Treki on his unanimous election to preside over the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. His election is a deserved tribute to his personal qualities as a seasoned politician and diplomat and also to his country  Libya  with which Malta has long-standing ties of friendship and cooperation. I am sure that under his wise leadership and experience this august Assembly will be guided throughout his term to a successful and fruitful outcome.  My delegation’s thanks and appreciation are extended to his distinguished predecessor  Father Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann  for the dedicated manner in which he presided over the work and activities of the sixty-third session.  Malta would like to take this opportunity to commend and thank the Secretary-General for his unstinting efforts in guiding our Organization in the maintenance of international peace and stability worldwide. Under his leadership the United Nations has made important strides in raising awareness and in many instances responding effectively to the critical situation of the poor and more vulnerable. It was therefore of great satisfaction to my Government and the Maltese people that we had the honour and privilege to welcome him to Malta last April.  This year Malta is marking three important anniversaries. The first is the forty-fifth anniversary of our country’s independence  on 21 September 1964; the second is the fifteenth anniversary of the coming into force on 21 March 1994 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; and the third is the fifteenth anniversary of the coming into force on 16 November 1994 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.  Over the past 45 years  Malta has made good on the pledge it made when it joined this Organization. In this regard  I would like to avail myself of this opportunity to renew today  on this forty-fifth anniversary of Malta’s United Nations membership  our pledge and our unwavering faith and trust in the ideals and purposes enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.  One of the issues which in the coming weeks will be at the top of the international agenda is the Copenhagen Summit. Two days ago  this Hall witnessed one of the largest-ever gatherings of Heads of State and Heads of Government to debate the future of our planet Earth. During this unique summit we all agreed that the challenges posed by climate change have become the most urgent and critical faced by humankind.  It will be recalled that in 1988  when Malta took the initiative to formally submit the issue of climate change as a political item on the agenda of the forty-third session of the General Assembly  few of us would have thought at that time that this issue of climate change would become in the span of two decades one of the principal critical issues dominating the international environmental concerns of this new century. Throughout these 20 years  Malta has been in the forefront of those ensuring that climate change continues to be one of the top-priority issues of our times. Our commitment of 20 years ago remains steadfast and as strong as ever. As we have heard during the past few days  the outcome of the Copenhagen Summit must signal a turning point. Malta strongly believes that it is the duty of all countries  large and small  rich and poor  to contribute their fair share to this concerted effort  which must be global if it is to succeed.    09-52425 54   On 16 November of this year  Member States will commemorate the fifteenth anniversary of the coming into force of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea  which has been described as the constitution for regulating humankind’s activities relating to the oceans. It was 42 years ago that  in this Hall  Malta once again called on Member States to undertake a reform of the law of the sea  which eventually culminated in the adoption of the current Convention on 10 December 1982.  It is also necessary to see the 1982 convention in the light of some pressing and contemporary problems which are either being addressed inadequately or not being addressed at all. Among these deficiencies are the provisions dealing with piracy  illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances  the rules relating to the protection and preservation of the marine environment and the rules dealing with submarine cables and pipelines. Examples of omissions are the trafficking of human beings  the safety and security of navigation  the transportation of weapons of mass destruction  and climate change.  In the light of the issues I have just mentioned  Malta feels that the time has come for the General Assembly to examine possible approaches to a review of the 1982 Convention on the Law of the Sea. In this context  Malta would like to propose that the General Assembly  through its relevant bodies  undertake appropriate consultations among its Member States to revise the Convention in view of the passage of time and the emergence of new and critical issues over the years. My delegation will be ready to enter into consultations with other interested Member States to advance this proposal further.  Just as it was necessary in 1948 to recognize the need for a universal declaration of human rights as a fundamental condition for the enjoyment of freedom  justice and peace for all men and women around the world  so it has become vital now to have a concomitant declaration on human duties of the present generation  including our responsibilities towards future generations. We have the overall task of conserving the human species in the sacredness of its life and in its continuity  as well as of preserving the environment  in all its manifestations. We believe that such a declaration emanates naturally from that doctrine of the common heritage of mankind  which my country first mooted before this Assembly in 1967 and which eventually led to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.  Malta believes that human duties are intrinsic to the personality  oneness and uniqueness of the human being  and are as inalienable as human rights. Those duties do not arise from laws or obligations but are inherent to the human being. Such duties relate to human beings themselves and to their fellow beings  and in a special manner to their family  to the community at all levels and to the natural and cultural environment in which their life evolves. The envisaged declaration  strengthening and fulfilling the thrust of the 1948 universal instrument  should mark the work of this Assembly as a consummate service to the international community. It should stand out as a major achievement of the United Nations at the beginning of the third millennium of our era. It is in this spirit that Malta proposes that consideration be given to the drafting of such a declaration on human duties and responsibilities.  Conflicts around the world have continued to affect the political  economic and social development of many countries and a large part of our societies. It is tragic that in the past decade more than two million innocent children were killed and six million seriously injured in conflicts. The role of the United Nations in preventive diplomacy and support to peace processes must enjoy strong and sustainable political backing from Member States.  A number of hotspots  from Somalia and Afghanistan to the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Middle East  continue to challenge our collective search for peaceful and long-lasting solutions for these war-torn countries and regions. Malta therefore welcomes our Organization’s engagement through its peacekeeping missions and peacebuilding mechanisms to foster political dialogue and reconciliation among the warring parties. We believe that assisting countries emerging from conflict in the rebuilding of the lives of their populations would contribute in no small way to providing the necessary support to nationally driven efforts in the achievement of sustainable peace and development.  One of the long-standing issues of which the United Nations has been seized since its inception is the question of the Middle East. Indeed  peace in the Middle East continues to evade our ongoing efforts. Malta reiterates its vision of a two-State solution  with   55 09-52425  both States living in secure and guaranteed frontiers  each recognizing the other’s sovereignty  and the right to peaceful coexistence. Malta calls in both parties to engage fully in resumed negotiations to this end  resulting in a viable Palestinian State on the basis of the June 1967 borders. This is not a view which we have adopted today. It is a vision that has been ours for decades  believing as we do that peace in the Middle East determines peace in the Mediterranean and beyond.  Malta’s strategic geographic location in the Mediterranean has placed it in the privileged yet responsible position of building bridges between the two continents. In fact  Malta’s vocation towards peace and security in the Mediterranean continues to occupy an important place of my Government’s foreign policy priorities. During the past 12 months  Malta has continued to build on the achievements made so far by enhancing the dialogue between countries in the Mediterranean region and the European Union and also with the League of Arab States. It is with a strong sense of political commitment and direction that we in Malta bear the responsibility of hosting the liaison office aimed at strengthening cooperation between the European Union and League of Arab States  which is due to be opened this coming October. Malta believes that the liaison office will render a major contribution to deepening mutual understanding through practical cooperation between Europe and the Arab world  as well as enhancing intercultural dialogue.  Members will recall that last year I raised the issue of the influx of illegal immigrants who risk their lives in crossing the Mediterranean to seek a new beginning. I had indicated that our size and our financial and human resources  which are very limited  make it extremely difficult for Malta to cope with the large number of these unfortunate people arriving on our shores on their way to mainland Europe. Malta has always dealt with this situation with great responsibility  humanity and benevolence  paying due respect to every human being without any exception. And we will continue to do so. At the same time  the problem of illegal immigration is an international phenomenon driven by external factors which cannot always be prevented or even mitigated by the countries directly affected by the problem. We therefore strongly feel that the United Nations should address the issue of illegal immigration in a holistic way so as to find solutions to a humanitarian problem that Malta and other like us  especially in the Mediterranean  are currently facing. Much more needs to be done  and all of us  including countries of origin and countries of transit  need to step up our efforts in order to deal with this challenge.  My Government is deeply appreciative of those countries that have come forward to assist us in coping with this phenomenon  including the United States of America  France  Lithuania  Luxembourg  Portugal  Slovenia and Slovakia. My Government also hopes that other countries will come forward to assist in alleviating the burden which Malta carries — a burden so acutely disproportionate to the country’s population  wealth and land area.  In his report on the work of the Organization  the Secretary-General has laid emphasis on the need to embark on a multilateral effort of immense magnitude “that draws upon the strengths and contributions of all the countries of the world  as well as their citizens” (A/64/1  para. 4). Malta believes that such an effort must find its foundations in this Organization where all Member States are equal and where the many challenges facing humankind can be addressed in a cohesive and coherent manner. The global challenges which the United Nations faces are our challenges. We  as Member States  have an obligation and the responsibility to ensure that our Organization lives up to the commitments and decisions that we  as heads of State and Government  solemnly undertake to implement in the best interests of our constituencies and societies.  Allow me to conclude by stating that Malta continues to strongly believe that together  as Members of the United Nations  we can and should continue to support the Organization  our Secretary-General and all those who contribute to making our world a better place for present and future generations. I know that Malta intends to do so."
"117",4727,"MMR",64,2009,"I would like to extend our warm congratulations to Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki on his well-deserved election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. I would also like to pay a special tribute to Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann for his able leadership of the sixty-third session of the General Assembly.  The global financial and economic crisis that began last year is showing tentative signs of abating. However  many countries large and small still face daunting challenges. The crisis originated in the developed countries  but the developing countries have been the hardest hit. The nascent economic recovery has yet to begin to lift the low-income countries from the trough.  It is commendable that the developed countries have played a leading role in addressing the crisis. The views of the developing countries should also be taken into consideration  together with those of the members of the Group of Eight and the Group of Twenty. Measures that could have adverse effects on the economic growth of developing countries must be avoided. The developing countries have worked long and hard to combat poverty and achieve favourable conditions for economic growth. Low-income countries require development aid beyond existing pledges of official development assistance (ODA) if they are to meet the challenges posed by the global economic downturn. The developed countries should increase their ODA to the developing countries. We welcome the reaffirmation by President Hu Jintao of the People’s Republic of China in his statement to this Assembly that his country will increase support for other developing countries hard hit by the economic and financial crisis.  Climate change is the most pressing major threat facing our planet. It is a global challenge that requires a global response. No country can be insulated from the consequences of climate change. The rapid pace and scale of climate change requires the global community to respond immediately and effectively. The United Nations Summit on Climate Change convened by the Secretary-General last week   9 09-52598  underlined the magnitude of the problem and the need to redouble our efforts in addressing climate change.  We look forward to the Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen in December. We hope that the negotiations will be fruitful and result in a new agreement to curb greenhouse gas emissions  to go into effect in 2012 when the Kyoto Protocol’s first commitment period expires. To be effective  any deal must be comprehensive and consistent with the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities.  The global financial and economic crisis and the climate change crisis have compounded the problems we have faced in recent years. These include rising food prices  high energy prices and the spread of pandemic diseases. No single country can effectively overcome these problems alone. The global community must work together to meet its common challenges. In these trying times for our planet  multilateralism is more important than ever. Dialogue among nations of different religious and cultural backgrounds can contribute to international peace  security and development.  The United Nations is the single world Organization dedicated to peace and development that enjoys almost universal participation. In recent years  steps have been initiated to reform the Organization in order to make it more democratic  effective and accountable and enable it to meet the challenges of the twenty-first century. Regrettably  progress has been painfully slow.  If the United Nations is to make decisions in a more democratic manner  it is essential that the role of the General Assembly — in which all Member States are represented — be enhanced. Security Council reform is also important. For many years  the General Assembly has debated the matter but made little headway. In addition to the focus on the vexed issue of enlarging the Council  we would like to see constructive changes in its procedures and working methods  particularly those that would make it more transparent and accountable.  The continued existence of weapons of mass destruction  particularly nuclear weapons  poses the greatest threat to mankind. Myanmar believes that the total elimination of nuclear weapons is the sole absolute guarantee against the threat or use of those weapons. Accordingly  we have called on nuclear-weapon States to undertake a step-by-step attenuation of the nuclear threat with a view to achieving the total elimination of those weapons.  We believe that  pending the total elimination of nuclear weapons  we should pursue efforts towards the conclusion of a universal  unconditional and legally binding instrument on security assurances to non-nuclear-weapon States. We support the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones on the basis of arrangements freely arrived at among States of the regions concerned. Nuclear-weapon-free zones enhance global and regional security and contribute to reaching the objectives of nuclear disarmament.  It is our hope that all nations of the world will continue to work together to eliminate nuclear weapons so that the power of the atom can be harnessed exclusively as a tool for the benefit of mankind and not as an instrument of self-destruction. At the same time  every nation has the right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy. Nuclear technologies have widespread applications in such areas as food  agriculture  health care  industry and science. We welcome last week’s summit meeting of the Security Council on nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament and its reaffirmation that the international nuclear non-proliferation regime should be maintained and strengthened to ensure the effective implementation of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.  Some powerful nations have resorted to economic sanctions to pressure developing countries. Their aim is to influence the political and economic systems of those countries without taking into account those countries’ historical and cultural backgrounds. Sanctions have no moral basis  as they not only hinder the economic and social development of peoples  but also interfere in matters that are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of the country concerned. As sanctions are indiscriminate and a form of violence per se  they cannot legitimately be regarded as a tool to promote human rights and democracy.   Sanctions are being employed as a political tool against Myanmar and we consider them unjust. I would like to state that such acts must cease. Myanmar practises a market economy based on agriculture. We are self-sufficient in terms of food and able to contribute to food security in the region. We have made considerable progress in improving socio-economic conditions thanks to the combined efforts of the Government and the people. Without the economic    09-52598 10  sanctions imposed on us  progress would be even greater.  Following Cyclone Nargis  which hit Myanmar in May 2008  the Myanmar Government  the United Nations and the Association of Southeast Nations established the Tripartite Core Group (TCG) to undertake relief  rehabilitation and reconstruction in the affected areas. The success of the TCG has been duly recognized by the international community and acknowledged as an exemplary mechanism for future disaster relief and rehabilitation.   The Post-Nargis Recovery and Preparedness Plan (PONREPP) has been established for the period 2009 to 2011. Further plans have also been adopted to effectively respond to similar natural disasters in the future. We will implement the projects diligently. PONREPP will require $691 million over a period of three years. To date  only half of that amount has been pledged by the international community. We have carried out many rehabilitation activities relying on our own funds and resources. If more funds were forthcoming and donors fulfilled their pledges  the rehabilitation process would be speedier and more effective.  The Myanmar Government and the people of the affected areas will always be grateful to the individuals  organizations and the international community at large that came to our assistance in our hour of need.  Domestic peace and stability and the successful holding of democratic elections are essential to the democratization process in Myanmar. A new State Constitution was approved by 92.48 per cent of eligible voters in a nationwide referendum held in May 2008. Multiparty general elections will be held in the coming year. Subsequently  Parliament will be convened and a Government formed in accordance with the new Constitution.  The country will have a bicameral legislature. The Constitution provides for a presidential system of governance. It is envisaged that the President will be elected by a presidential electoral college. The State will be composed of seven states  seven regions  five self-administered zones  and one self-administered division. The capital  Nay Pyi Taw  will be designated union territory. In keeping with the State structure  the Constitution also establishes 14 State and regional legislative bodies.  The transition to democracy is proceeding. Our focus is not on the narrow interests of individuals  organizations or parties  but on the larger interests of the entire nation. We have urged all citizens  whether they agree with us or not  to participate actively in the process without losing sight of the democratic goal. In this way  the aspirations of the people will be fulfilled.  The President returned to the Chair.  The Government is taking systematic steps to hold free and fair elections. Electoral laws will be promulgated and an election commission created so that political parties can be formed and contest the elections. On 17 September 2009  7 114 prisoners were released for good conduct. They  too  will be able to participate in the general elections next year in accordance with the law.  The holding of a multiparty general election is a significant step in our transition to a peaceful  modern and developed democratic State. Democracy cannot be imposed from the outside  and a system suitable for Myanmar can be born only out of Myanmar society. It is the citizens of Myanmar who can best determine their own future. They can judge the merits of democracy and make adjustments as they see fit. The international community can best assist Myanmar’s emergence as a new nation  based on the principles of justice  freedom and equality enshrined in the new State Constitution  by demonstrating understanding.  Global issues that require the attention of all countries will increasingly come to the fore in the years to come. Firm political will and commitment of all countries will be needed to overcome the challenges. Previous speakers have emphasized the need for collective efforts to find solutions to those problems and challenges. I fully share their views and affirm that Myanmar will do its part."
"118",4738,"MNE",64,2009,"At the outset  please allow me to congratulate Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki on his election as President of the United Nations General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. We wish him success in his work and assure him of Montenegro’s unwavering support.  I would also like to thank the former President  Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann  for his endeavours and personal contribution in discharging this challenging post.  At the same time I would like to pay my tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  for his outstanding efforts in leading the Organization in these trying times.  As we have heard from the statements of previous distinguished speakers  given the impact of the world economic and financial crisis and related food and energy crises  climate change and the flu pandemic on the economic and social growth and development  politics and global relations  including achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and other internationally agreed development goals  only a coordinated and a concerted global effort can yield positive results.  Response to current challenges requires  therefore  that we pool all capacities and resources  as well as a strong political will from us all. In this  the key role belongs to the United Nations  the world’s most important multilateral forum.  Montenegro  as a country that advocates the equality of peoples and nations in international relations  is fully committed to active participation in efforts to work out a global response to present-day challenges. Preserving peace and security through activities aimed at creating positive political  economic  social and cultural environments for the implementation and respect of international law  the rule of law and the protection and promotion of fundamental human rights and freedoms are the main principles and bases of the Montenegrin foreign policy priorities.  In that regard  Montenegro remains strongly committed to the fundamental principles and purposes of the United Nations Charter  which imply peaceful resolution of disputes and non-interference in the internal affairs of States.    09-52470 34   Strong cooperation with neighbouring countries and regional stability are the underlying principles of the foreign policy of Montenegro and a precondition for progress in its broader integration processes. Since the previous General Assembly session  we have moved to a new and more demanding phase of European and Euro-Atlantic integration. We feel particularly encouraged by the dynamic progress Montenegro has made towards membership in the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). We expect that in the near future the European Commission will issue an opinion on Montenegro’s preparedness for EU membership  and we also expect an invitation to join in the NATO Membership Action Plan  which will open additional opportunities for those two integration processes to gain momentum.  Taking into consideration the strong impact of the world economic and financial crisis on overall socio-economic development  the most recent reports from the global financial markets are encouraging  indicating an end to the global crisis even earlier than expected. However  in order to ensure sustained economic development  increased aid and implementation of trade agreements and the achievement of international solidarity is imperative in addressing the needs of the world’s poorest and most vulnerable.  Given that the recovery is going to be long and gradual  all countries  led by the United Nations  should be committed to the implementation of policies and measures initiated in the various international forums  including the United Nations Conference on the world economic and financial crisis and its impact on development  the G-20  World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.  Bearing in mind the nature of the Montenegrin economy as a small and open system  we have not been able to remain immune to the turbulent global developments. In that regard  the Government of Montenegro has adopted a package of economic policy measures aimed at maintaining macroeconomic stability  improving productivity and preserving a favourable economic environment.  The harmful consequences of climate change  increasing energy consumption and growing dependence on imported fossil fuels  along with their negative impacts on the environment and standards of living  are issues causing profound concern among us all. The Summit on Climate Change held on the eve of the general debate is  in our view  a significant step forward in Member States’ political support for the process of the implementation of the MDGs in this field.  We believe that both the character and the effects of climate change call for a comprehensive international response based on the principles of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)  which would facilitate sustainable economic development of society in accordance with the guidelines of the 2007 Bali Action Plan.  I would like to take this opportunity to express Montenegro’s strong support for the negotiation process on a new post-2012 climate framework and for calls to “seal the deal” in Copenhagen in December.  We believe that further efforts need to be made to promote a green recovery and to build up national capacities for adaptation and mitigation of the impact of climate change  while simultaneously stimulating innovation and economic growth  contributing to poverty reduction and ensuring access to sustainable energy sources.  In that regard  we underline the importance of regional cooperation  which enables us to implement adaptation and mitigation measures in a regional context  which promotes political dialogue and leads to more effective action by States in the talks within the UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol frameworks.  In order to contribute to the efforts being undertaken at the national and international levels in addressing the impact of climate change on the environment and economic development and in reaching a successful deal in Copenhagen  Montenegro will organize a regional conference on climate change and sustainable development for the Mediterranean and South-East European countries in Budva  on 16 and 17 October.  The Millennium Development Goals require each and every one of us to redouble our efforts to reduce poverty  improve health and education  promote peace and human rights  and achieve sustainable development. We are aware that it is the primary responsibility of States to take measures aimed at improving the social security of the poor and vulnerable segments of society and alleviating the most   35 09-52470  severe consequences of poverty. In this context we strongly welcome the convening of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) review summit in 2010.  Montenegro strongly supports and is committed to fulfilment of the MDGs and implementation of all United Nations documents — including the Millennium Declaration — related to development issues and the special needs of Africa  as a pre-emptive action aimed at creating a safer world. As a country moving towards European integration  we welcome the European Union-Africa partnership and the efforts currently under way to find solutions to development needs and to root out poverty on the African continent.   In this regard  we support the message of the 2008 Yokohama Declaration aimed at giving momentum to current development issues  including education  health and sanitary measures within the framework of the MDGs  the development of agriculture to improve food security  measures to tackle climate change  as well as establishing and maintaining peace as a prerequisite for economic growth.  We emphasize the crucial importance of the debate on the concept of the responsibility to protect  and we fully support the activities of the Secretary-General and the assessments outlined in his latest report. We believe that an upsurge of internal conflicts and serious violations of human rights in the 1990s has spurred a discussion on the need for the protection of civilians in armed conflict  which has unquestionably led to further deliberations on and analyses of the primary obligation of each State to protect its citizens from genocide  war crimes  ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity  as well as to consideration of the international community’s responsibility in the event that countries fail to act. In this context  we underline the importance of reaching an agreement on an appropriate concept and instruments within the framework of the United Nations and international law  based on a broad consensus of all actors.  In supporting peacekeeping missions as efficient and dynamic instruments for monitoring respect of human rights and building sustainable institutions in conflict areas  we have established legal prerequisites within our security policy in order to be able to contribute our military and police troops to the United Nations peacekeeping missions  including missions to Liberia  Afghanistan and Cyprus and the European Union peace operation in Somalia.   Given the problems of the Balkan region  Montenegro attaches particular importance to a policy that addresses the needs of refugees  asylum-seekers and internally displaced persons (IDPs) and is conducting extensive activities aimed at finding lasting solutions for the refugees and IDPs from the territory of the former Yugoslavia. As part of those efforts  a renewed registration procedure supported by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is under way for refugees and IDPs living in Montenegro to resolve their final status  in accordance with the highest international standards and international law instruments.  In this regard we highlight the importance of a comprehensive approach and the need for the cooperation of all actors  primarily UNHCR  the European Commission and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.  Montenegro stresses the importance of the promotion of and the respect for international law in the development of international relations today. In this context  the rule of law and the protection of human rights have an irreplaceable role in the fight against international terrorism  the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and organized crime.  We are firmly convinced that only the coordinated efforts of the global community can take on international terrorism. Montenegro supports the implementation of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy  as well as measures to fight corruption  organized crime  drug trafficking and human trafficking  and we further underscore the need for cooperation among all the bodies of the United Nations system  in particular the committees of the Security Council and the Counter-Terrorism Committee.   Montenegro attaches particular importance to the fulfilment of the obligations stipulated by the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances and it actively participates in projects of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime  which contribute to regional peace and stability  strengthening of the judiciary and a more efficient fight against all forms of organized crime.    09-52470 36   In view of all of the above  it is clear that the responsibility of the United Nations is only increasing. We therefore welcome the reform process of the world Organization and hope that it will result in a more democratic and representative United Nations. We attach particular importance to strengthening the role and efficiency of the General Assembly and its main bodies  and fully support intergovernmental talks on Security Council reform. These negotiations offer an opportunity for small States to express their interests  in addition to providing a vision for an improved and more transparent functioning of the most important United Nations organ.  As the Assembly may know  this past June the United Nations Development Group identified Montenegro as a country eligible for implementation of the Delivering as One pilot initiative launched within the framework of the overall reform process aimed at improving the efficiency  coherence and coordination of United Nations development programmes on the ground. In our view  that decision recognizes Montenegro’s strong commitment to United Nations standards and values and provides an endorsement of the highly successful joint efforts of the United Nations team and the Montenegrin Government.  Given the myriad of challenges and their negative effects on the environment  as well as the potential increase in social  religious and cultural tensions leading to political instability  only the coordinated and comprehensive response of all international stakeholders  including civil society and the private sector  can create the preconditions for efficiently addressing the consequences of the ongoing crises. In this regard  the United Nations has a decisive role to play in coordinating efforts towards the achievement of concrete results.  Convinced of the great potential of the United Nations  if supported by the active participation of Member States  we reiterate Montenegro’s commitment to building a responsible international community ready to meet the needs of all of its members."
"119",4784,"MNG",64,2009,"Let me join others in extending our sincere congratulations to Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki on his unanimous election to preside over this session of the General Assembly. I am confident that under his able stewardship this session will mark an important milestone in meeting the formidable challenges of our times.  And the challenges we face as a human family are unprecedented indeed. No nation  no country is immune to the ruthless grip of the multitude of global crises: economy and finance  fuel and food  flu pandemics and climate change. These and other global challenges require global solutions underpinned by a new multilateralism. Multilateralism that is effective  proactive and commensurate with today’s demands. Never has the world needed an effective multilateralism as much as we do now; as the Secretary-General has rightly put it  “This is the ultimate multilateral moment” (A/64/1  para. 4).  Mongolia highly commends the strong leadership of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in the effort to make this Organization the centre of the new multilateralism. We also applaud his unwavering commitment to mobilizing broad political support to address today’s pressing challenges. Thanks to his initiative  on the 22nd of this month we witnessed an unprecedented gathering of world leaders. That has provided the necessary political impetus for Copenhagen  and I was both humbled and honoured to    09-52470 12  serve as one of the co-chairs of the round tables. As a result  we have all agreed that in Copenhagen we must reach the long-awaited agreement. The political will was clearly displayed. The deal must be within our grasp.  Climate change poses a truly existential threat to humanity. As a country intimately affected by climate change  Mongolia deems it important to complement global efforts with those at regional and subregional levels. With that in mind  we have proposed a North-east Asia Summit on Climate Change. A series of preparatory meetings have been held over the last two years  including meetings with experts and young people  and with senior officials and ministers  in March and May respectively.  It has become increasingly evident that extensive effects of climate change have already appeared in most parts of the subregion  which has become more exposed to drought; desertification; reduced water resources; land degradation; increased occurrence of natural disasters and melting of permafrost  glaciers and snow cover. The resulting poverty  food shortages and spread of infectious disease will have an increasing effect on the sustainable development of the countries in the region. Hence the urgent need for joint efforts to redress the situation  mitigate risks and enhance those countries’ adaptive capacity. We remain hopeful that they will continue their active engagement in the preparations for the Summit next year.  Allow me to share briefly our views on issues we deem important as we collectively seek to identify effective responses to the global crises. First  my delegation believes that the multiple nature of the crises has to be taken into account in order to find an adequate response at the global level. This in itself is a daunting task  requiring of us the courage to rise beyond mere national or group interests in order to survive collectively in our one — global — human village.  Secondly  in all our policies and actions we need to focus on people — on the human costs of overcoming the dire consequences of multiple crises. According to the World Bank’s latest report  released last week  the ongoing global economic  financial and food crises have plunged hundreds of millions more people into the iron grip of poverty  hunger  unemployment  illiteracy and ill-health.  Despite this grim situation we are nonetheless encouraged by a broadly shared recognition that the vulnerable countries  including landlocked developing countries (LLDCs) ought to be assisted to withstand the harsh impact of the crises. In this regard  we look forward to the Group of 20 meeting in Pittsburgh to substantially increase support and assistance to vulnerable and low-income countries.  Every sixth Member of the United Nations is a landlocked developing country with inherent development handicaps. Indeed  lack of territorial access to the sea  remoteness from world markets and the consequent high transportation costs and undue delays are major impediments for LLDCs. Hence  Mongolia  together with other like-minded countries  has endeavoured to promote the common position and interests of the Group of LLDCs at both the United Nations and the World Trade Organization. The recent establishment of an international think tank for LLDCs in Ulaanbaatar will  in our view  enhance our coordinated efforts for the effective implementation of the Almaty Programme of Action and the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).  Thirdly  the marginalization and inadequate representation of the developing world in global decision-making constitute another drawback to the strength of the new multilateralism. Hence the need for a reformed global governance structure. Mongolia believes that  with its impartiality and universal legitimacy  the United Nations is uniquely placed to serve as the centre of the new multilateralism. Our world Organization has embarked on a process of reform in order to better respond to multifaceted challenges. Important progress has been made in several reform areas  yet more efforts are needed to adapt the United Nations to the realities of the twenty-first century.  We expect the General Assembly negotiations on Security Council reform to make meaningful progress at this session by meeting the demand of the overwhelming majority of Member States to expand the Council in both the permanent and the non-permanent categories. A revitalized General Assembly  a greater role for the Economic and Social Council in global economic governance and enhanced United Nations capacity in building democracy and peacebuilding are also needed. Mongolia fully supports Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s efforts to improve   13 09-52470  the management  efficiency and internal cohesion of the United Nations system.   With a view to making our humble contribution to promoting effective international cooperation in the economic  social and related fields  Mongolia has proposed its candidature for consideration at the election next month for membership of the Economic and Social Council for 2010-2012. We are deeply grateful to our fellow members of the Asian Group for their endorsement of our candidature and look forward to the kind support of the broader membership of the United Nations.  Fourthly  in order to find effective solutions to global crises we need to do away with the triple deficit — a deficit of political will and commitment; a deficit of implementation; and a deficit of resources — that all too often has impeded the pursuit of our common efforts. Those are some of the issues that in our view warrant the consideration of the international community in order to formulate our collective approach to the pressing challenges at hand.  Mongolia has continuously based its foreign policy on active participation in multilateral cooperation through the United Nations. Our engagement has ranged from non-proliferation and disarmament to promoting democracy and literacy and from addressing the special needs of LLDCs to responding to climate change and contributing to peacekeeping operations  programmes and funds.  As a North-East Asian nation with an internationally recognized nuclear-weapon-free status  Mongolia stands for a nuclear-weapon-free Korean peninsula. Achieving a comprehensive solution to the nuclear issue through dialogue is of utmost importance. We hope that all countries concerned will look to the future in the interest of peace and stability in the region. We stand ready to contribute to this effort.  Yesterday the international community witnessed another strong signal of strengthened multilateralism  particularly in the area of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. The Security Council summit chaired by President Obama (see S/PV.6191) confirmed the path towards a world free of nuclear weapons by adopting the historic resolution 1887 (2009).  Next year will mark the tenth anniversary of the renowned Brahimi report (A/55/305)  which charted a renewed vision for United Nations peacekeeping operations. We are proud that Mongolia has joined the ranks of active members of the United Nations peacekeeping family. With its latest deployment of a battalion to the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic and Chad  we have become one of the top 20 troop contributors. Mongolia stands committed to enhancing its contribution  including through hosting training for civil police and medical personnel at its peacekeeping operations training centre.  Later this year we will observe the twentieth anniversary of the start of the democratic evolution in my home country. Mongolia is proud of its successful democratic transition and major gains in the political  economic  social and spiritual areas of the life of our society. Yet  as a young democracy  my country is also intimately aware of the complex challenges faced by countries in transition. Democracy and respect for human rights are  in our view  inherently woven into the MDGs. Proceeding from this premise  Mongolia was the first country to adopt  in 2005  its own ninth MDG  on strengthening human rights  fostering democratic governance and zero tolerance to corruption.  We believe in international cooperation and support for democratization efforts. In this regard  Mongolia applauds the increased role of the United Nations in fostering democracy and good governance. The United Nations Democracy Fund is a notable example and Mongolia is proud to serve on its Advisory Board. The United Nations has also been an important stakeholder in the success of the new or restored democracies process.  Over the past nearly five decades of Mongolia’s membership in the United Nations  our multifaceted cooperation has made a valuable contribution to our development. I am pleased to underscore that this received a considerable boost from the official visit to Mongolia of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon last July. We will closely work with the United Nations to ensure effective follow-up to the visit.  In conclusion  I reiterate Mongolia’s strong resolve to continue its active participation in multilateral cooperation. We will spare no effort to ensure that the world Organization remains a centre for coordination of the efforts of the community of nations towards peace and development in the years to come."
"120",4825,"MOZ",64,2009,"It is a great honour for me to have this opportunity to address the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session to share the views and offer the contribution of the Republic of Mozambique on some of the challenges facing the world today.  I would like  on behalf of my delegation  to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki on his unanimous election to preside over this session of the General Assembly. I assure him of the full support and collaboration of Mozambique for the successful discharge of his noble mission.  We pay tribute to his predecessor  Father Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann — a great sponsor of popular liberation — for the resolute manner in which he presided over the General Assembly at its sixty-third session  and for his tireless efforts in favour of and devotion to the poorest and most disadvantaged. Father Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann’s engagement as an advocate for those suffering in the Palestinian territories and his strong leadership  demonstrated by bringing together the 192 Member States of the United Nations to address the financial and economic crisis  have given us a vivid example of how commitment and generosity  combined with vision and resolve  can   11 09-52604  make a difference in bringing the international community together in the search for solutions to current global problems.  I wish to convey to this gathering the warmest greetings of His Excellency President Armando Emílio Guebuza  who could not be present today due to pressing national commitments. Indeed  on 28 October this year  Mozambique will hold its fourth general election. There will also be elections for provincial parliaments for the first time in the country’s history. These elections attest to our strong political will and commitment to further strengthening democracy in the country  where the rule of law and the promotion and protection of the human rights of all Mozambicans unite us in our fight against absolute poverty and for peace  stability and sustainable development.  As a result of this enabling political environment  Mozambique has recorded steady economic performance and signals of economic stability over the past five years  with an average gross domestic product growth rate of 7.8 per cent. Poverty levels decreased from 69.4 per cent in 1997 to 54.1 per cent in 2003. As a result of our discernible progress in education  health  water and sanitation  we expect to reduce poverty to 45 per cent by the end of the current year. However  the current global financial and economic crisis is constraining our progress towards that goal; it was recently forecast that our economic growth may slow to 4.3 per cent in 2009.  In this context  the Government’s focus is to ensure that the effects of the crisis  combined with cyclical natural disasters  as well as diseases like pandemic HIV/AIDS and endemic malaria and tuberculosis  are not deepened and do not create conditions that would prevent our return to the economic and social growth I just described. Mozambique welcomes the launching  here at the United Nations on 23 September 2009  of the African Leaders Malaria Alliance  and pledges to play an active role in support of this new mechanism aimed at coordinating our responses to the scourge of malaria.  Climate change is another pressing challenge. Therefore  we cannot afford to fail to seal the deal in December at the fifteenth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  in Copenhagen. It is our hope that the commitments made during the Summit on Climate Change  held on 22 September  will inspire the deliberations in Copenhagen.  In southern Africa  we continue our efforts towards regional economic integration  the consolidation of democracy  good governance and political stability. It is within this framework that progress has been made in the implementation of the Free Trade Area in the Southern African Development Community (SADC)  and that free and fair elections have been held in a number of countries in the region.   In spite of these advances  we continue to face challenges in many areas that still demand our attention  in particular those of peace  security and stability. In this regard  Mozambique  in its capacity as chair of the SADC Organ on Politics  Defence and Security Cooperation  will strive to ensure the success of the common regional efforts to eradicate pockets of instability so as to enable our countries to concentrate on achieving the social and economic development goals that our peoples are longing for.  We are encouraged by the progress made in the implementation of the Global Political Agreement in Zimbabwe  which is enabling the country to move towards an atmosphere of political and social stability conducive to permanent dialogue  reconstruction and economic recovery. The economic challenges facing Zimbabwe  associated with the current global economic crisis and the continued sanctions applied by some international development partners  make the desired rapid economic recovery hard to achieve. We therefore reiterate the SADC call for the removal of all sanctions against Zimbabwe.  We are concerned by the attempts to undermine the agreements signed in Maputo by all Malagasy political movements on 9 August 2009  and we condemn any unilateral decision that violates the spirit of the agreements. We reaffirm our support for the ongoing political dialogue in Madagascar and urge all political stakeholders to fully implement the Maputo agreements.  In addition to the subregional efforts to address the current situation of conflicts in Africa  a special session of the African Union was convened in August in Tripoli to consider a wide range of conflicts with a view to finding solutions and establishing consolidated and sustainable peace  security and stability on the continent. It is in this spirit that Mozambique commends and supports the ongoing initiatives at the    09-52604 12  regional and continental levels aimed at promoting durable and sustainable peace and stability in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  Darfur and Somalia  among other areas.  With regard to the Middle East  Mozambique is encouraged by the prospects for an effective  viable and durable two-State solution for the Palestinians and Israelis  as well as for broader Arab-Israeli normalization as a result of the commitments made by relevant stakeholders during this general debate.  The time has come for us to act together at the national  regional and international levels to ensure the speedy and full implementation of the internationally agreed development goals  including the Millennium Development Goals. We reiterate our recognition of the vital role played by the United Nations in coordinating international efforts in the search for sustainable responses to the problems facing the world today.   In this regard  it is worth recalling the urgent need to accelerate the ongoing reform of the United Nations  including the reform of the Security Council  the revitalization of the General Assembly  and the process of reforming the United Nations system to make it more effective  efficient and coherent and thus more responsive to the development needs of developing countries. Indeed  as one of the eight pilot countries testing the Delivering as One initiative  Mozambique is fully engaged in the reform of the United Nations system at the country level.  Mozambique strongly believes in multilateralism  and that the United Nations is at the centre of it. We also believe that the United Nations is a special forum that brings together the universal aspirations for a peaceful  secure  stable and prosperous world  where the values of tolerance  respect for human rights and international cooperation for development are upheld.  In conclusion  I wish to reiterate Mozambique’s commitment to continuing to engage in international efforts to address issues of global concern  in particular the fight against poverty  the negative impact of climate change  and the promotion of sustainable development."
"121",4871,"MRT",64,2009,"I should like at the outset  on behalf of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania as well as on my own account  to congratulate you  Sir  on your election to preside over the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session and to wish you every possible success in your serious and noble mission. I have a great deal of confidence that your efforts will bear fruit and enable the Organization to continue to achieve the success attained under the presidency of your predecessor  Father Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann.  I should also like to convey my gratitude and appreciation to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for the efforts he has devoted to consolidating peace and security throughout the world  to achieving the Millennium Development Goals and to promoting the fight against climate change.  This session is being held at a time when my country is extricating itself from a political and institutional crisis that lasted for a few months and was resolved  with the help of the efforts of the International Contact Group on Mauritania  through a consensus reached by the political parties of Mauritania and enshrined in the Dakar Accord. This agreement provided for the elaboration of an electoral agenda supervised by a Government of national unity in which minority parties in Parliament enjoy half of the number of seats  including among the sovereign ministries  such as the Ministries of Home Affairs  Information  Defence and others.  The normalization of the constitutional process led to the election of Mr. Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz as President of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania. He received 53 per cent of the votes during the first round of the elections held on 18 July and all national and international observers attested to the transparency and fairness of this election.  On behalf of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania  I convey my special gratitude to the International Contact Group  and especially to the President of the African Union  the Leader Muammar Al-Qadhafi  who was one of the first to call for a domestic solution  thus enabling Mauritanian stakeholders to normalize the political situation in their country. I also convey my gratitude to His Excellency Abdoulaye Wade  President of the brotherly country of Senegal  who accompanied the signing of the Dakar Accord and ensured its follow-up implementation.  Mauritania  under the presidency of Mr. Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz  is determined to consolidate democracy and institutions and uphold the rule of law in a spirit of calm and stability  thereby    09-52604 2  providing for the progress and well-being of the people of Mauritania.  Aware of the need to integrate peoples and States  Mauritania reiterates its attachment to the Arab Maghreb Union as a strategic choice for the people of the region. It also affirms its attachment to joint work within the framework of the League of Arab States  as well as its commitment to the African Union and to United Nations purposes and principles   We reiterate our support for efforts aimed at reforming the United Nations  especially the expansion of the Security Council  where a permanent seat should be granted to the African continent and another to the Arab Group  whose people make up more than 11 per cent of the world population.  The tremendous efforts undertaken during the sixty-third session of the General Assembly are praiseworthy  whether we are referring to the Doha Review Conference or the conference on the world financial and economic crisis and its impact on development. Despite these commendable efforts  the world continues to be wracked by a stifling financial crisis that has undermined development efforts  especially in the least developed countries (LDCs). The impact of the financial crisis on the economies of the LDCs is disastrous. While the rich countries of the North have achieved economic and social progress during these past few years  the least developed countries will face many obstacles that will have an impact on programmes aimed at achieving their Millennium Development Goals.  The international community must act rapidly to confront this disaster that threatens the global economic order. It must take concrete measures aimed at restoring confidence  achieving economic progress and creating jobs. Commerce  trade and investment must be revitalized to provide the necessary financing to poor countries and to maintain achievements made thus far in the fight against poverty and in strengthening the role of the United Nations Development Programme in countering the economic crisis and its adverse impact on development.  In this respect  we urge rich countries to fulfil the commitments made in London in early April towards financing development in developing countries  and their pledges to allocate $1 trillion to revitalize the global economy  including $50 billion devoted to the low income countries. I pay tribute to all of those steps from this rostrum.  The economic  social and environmental dimensions of development are all closely interlinked. For that reason we call upon all countries to fight against climate change. My country is one of the ten countries most affected by global warming  which could lead to a rise in sea level. Here  we request that industrialized States limit their greenhouse gas emissions. We also welcome the meeting on climate change that was convened by the Secretary-General and await the outcome of the international conference on climate change to be held in December in Copenhagen  with great interest.  My country follows the issue of the Western Sahara with great interest and reaffirms its backing for the efforts of the Secretary-General and his Special Envoy aimed at finding a final solution to this issue  which would strengthen security and stability in the region.  The Arab-Israeli conflict is a source of ongoing tension and a threat to international peace and security in a sensitive and vital region of the world. For that reason  we support peace efforts aimed at finding a solution to the conflict that will  on the one hand  guarantee the brotherly Palestinian people all of their rights  including the establishment of an independent Palestinian State  with East Jerusalem as its capital  and the right to live in peace and security side by side with Israel; and on the other hand  will restore all occupied Arab territories  including the Syrian Golan and the Lebanese Sheba'a farms.  Turning to the situation in the Sudan  we wish here to underscore our categorical rejection of the International Criminal Court’s arrest warrant for the Sudanese President  because it undermines peace efforts under way in that country and runs counter to international norms.   The culture of peace  tolerance  justice and respect for peoples and civilizations is the best possible way to uphold international peace and security. Outstanding issues are still without an available solution; the chasm between the rich and the poor and the turbulent international economic infrastructure have led to tension  extremism and terrorism. Here I reaffirm that the Islamic Republic of Mauritania rejects terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and reiterates its commitment to Islamic values  which   3 09-52604  reject violence and extremism and call for tolerance and fraternity. We believe that it is the duty of the international community to consider seriously the causes of this phenomenon and to devise ways to confront it and eradicate it once and for all.   Fulfilling the commitments that the international community made in creating this Organization will only be possible if all peoples and all countries share the available resources and possibilities for successful development  and if the policies of the countries of the North are rooted in a vision of dignified  free and equal existence for all. In my view this is the only way to reach the objectives that this Organization was created for."
"122",4917,"MUS",64,2009,"On behalf of my delegation  and in my own name  I extend to the President our warmest congratulations on his well-deserved election to preside over the sixty-fourth session of the Assembly. I also commend the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  for his tireless efforts at the helm of our Organization in the cause of international peace and security.  In this globalized world  nations will increasingly face unconventional  emerging threats to their security. The recent rapid spread of the A (H1N1) virus is a case in point. The commitment of the entire membership of our Organization is required to forge a consensus to deal with the uncertainties of the times ahead. More than ever before  multilateralism will be the way forward.    09-52463 40   As we confronted the severe food and energy crises of a year ago  little did we realize that the world was about to be engulfed in an unprecedented economic crisis. The most severe meltdown since the Great Depression has spared no country  precisely because we live in an interconnected world. Millions of people all over the world have lost their jobs  their incomes and their savings. It is estimated that an additional 50 million people have already been driven into extreme poverty. Whatever modest progress developing countries had achieved has been severely set back.  The world may be witnessing the early signs of a slow recovery. However  the aftershocks of the crisis will continue to be felt for much longer. Developing countries have experienced declining capital flows  stagnating foreign aid and a fall in remittances and export revenues.  Mauritius  with a small open economy  has been exceptionally exposed to the adverse effects of the crisis. Although both our manufacturing sector and our tourism industry have been negatively impacted  we have registered positive economic growth. This is due to the reforms my Government has implemented since 2005. Bold reforms have succeeded in making our economy more resilient. In 2008  our gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 5.3 per cent and the unemployment rate dropped to 7.2 per cent. Mauritius attracted foreign direct investment amounting to almost 5 per cent of GDP  and achieved the highest level of job creation in more than a decade.  However  the global crisis has been a severe blow. Growth has been slowed; we expect growth of around 2.7 per cent this year. But our economy is now structurally more sound  more competitive and resilient. We are concerned that a prolonged crisis could drive our export-oriented economy into reverse gear  with further declines in trade and capital flows  exchange rate volatility  and further falls in tourist arrivals.  To mitigate the damage to our economy  we reacted as soon as the first signs of the subprime crisis started in the United States. We introduced an expansionary budget with emphasis on infrastructural projects  and as the crisis spread into a worldwide financial and economic crisis we put in place a stimulus package to save jobs  protect people and prepare for the recovery. We have  in other words  been ahead of the curve. In this uncertain economic situation  the priority of Mauritius is to safeguard the hard-earned gains from past reforms.  We have been collateral victims of financial imbalances  over-leveraged financial institutions  inadequate regulation and deficient supervision. Developing countries benefit little from periods of boom  and pay an inordinately high price for the busts that often follow. We hope that strengthening regulations and supervision will prevent the accumulation of high-risk  toxic assets that led to the crisis in the first place.  The crisis has also made it clear that the Bretton Woods institutions stand in need of fundamental reform. However  reforms will be effective only if they take into account the long-term stability and sustainability of the global economy. Institutions that make global decisions must reflect the changing nature of the global economic environment.  For too long we have condoned a clear democratic deficit in global economic governance. We need to reshape the global economy into a more equitable system  responsive to the needs of all countries and reflecting the realities of the day. In this regard  we appreciate the convening of the United Nations Conference on the World Financial and Economic Crisis and Its Impact on Development  held last June. The Conference provided a uniquely inclusive platform to address the urgent concerns of all nations. It has allowed the formulation of proposals to lessen the impact of the crisis  especially on vulnerable populations.  The implementation of the Conference’s recommendations should avoid a further deterioration in the conditions of the world’s poor. And we look forward to the recommendations of the Group of 20 (G20) Summit  which starts today in Pittsburgh.  In coping with the effects of the crisis  we have to resist the temptation to resort to trade protectionism. We should not forget that international trade has been a powerful engine for development and has generated substantial economic growth. From our perspective as a vulnerable small island developing State  it is vital that markets remain open and that international trade flows are not impeded.  It is essential that the Doha Round  with development at its core  be successfully concluded    41 09-52463  without  however  any unravelling of the July 2008 convergence package. We look forward to significant progress at the seventh session of the World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference  scheduled for December in Geneva.  The negative impact of the economic crisis on the most vulnerable populations causes us great concern. The global economic slowdown has further delayed the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Confronted with this grave setback  the developing world looks for a strong demonstration of solidarity.  We hope that the donor community will do more than just honour its previous commitments. The Millennium Declaration  the Monterrey Consensus and the Doha Declaration on Financing for Development have been overtaken by the events of the past year.  But I strongly believe that what we need now is a change in our approach in the developing economies. We need to urgently apply ourselves to making pro-business policy reforms instead of just relying on aid. That is the way to create wealth and prosperity. Charity is a noble endeavour  but relying on charity alone is not the answer to future prosperity and opportunity for all.  We need to unleash the entrepreneurial drive of our people. That is the ultimate answer to the eradication of poverty. We all know that it is better to show a man how to fish than to give him a fish every day. And we need to coordinate our actions to bring down trade barriers. In fact  what the developing countries need is a Marshall Plan  with a single coordinated programme. To qualify  countries need to meet benchmarks for good governance  respect for human rights  accessible health care and education and predictable economic policies.  Such a plan was successful in uplifting the economies of Europe after the Second World War. I have no doubt that it can be adapted to meet the same measure of success for developing countries.  At the national level  my Government is mobilizing considerable resources to meet the Millennium Development Goals. In a relentless drive to fight poverty  we have introduced an eradication of absolute poverty programme  which aims to break the vicious circle of poverty begetting poverty. And  to show our commitment to eradicating poverty in our region  Mauritius took the initiative to host the Southern African Development Community (SADC) International Consultative Conference on Poverty and Development last year so that we can develop a common pragmatic approach. We are committed to the attainment of the MDGs on schedule  and look forward to the high-level review meeting next year.  Ensuring the fulfilment of the MDGs demands a stronger commitment by national Governments in the fight against HIV/AIDS. We are heartened in this instance by the response of the international community  which has been timely  generous and effective. Each and every nation must be fully engaged in this fight.  In Mauritius  we treat HIV/AIDS as a national priority. I have set up a National AIDS Committee  which I chair. We have put in place a multisectoral strategy to protect the population at large  with special emphasis on vulnerable groups. And yesterday I was delighted to learn about the breakthrough of an HIV/AIDS vaccine which could be available in the not too distant future.  Recently  the A (H1N1) pandemic has rapidly taken on alarming proportions. Although we have taken all possible steps to effectively deal with this new influenza virus  the escalation of the outbreak could stretch our health resources and infrastructure. In this connection  developing countries require early access to the vaccines that are in the pipeline  once their safety is assured.  Food security should have been an absolute priority of development strategies. It has for far too long been neglected. Many countries struggle to guarantee adequate food for their people. The present economic recession compounds an already difficult situation. Over a billion people  mostly in developing countries  do not have sufficient food to meet their daily basic nutritional needs. One in six of the human family goes to bed hungry and angry.  The present relative decline in food prices must not make us lose sight of the structural long-term deficit the world faces. This age-old problem is complicated by uncertainties linked to climate change and the diversion of food crops for bio-fuel production.  We must strengthen measures to improve food security globally. Existing funding mechanisms must    09-52463 42  be improved to assist the World Food Programme to effectively avoid recurrent outbreaks of famine.  Mauritius welcomes the initiative of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) to convene the World Summit on Food Security in Rome in November. It is our earnest hope that it will not be just another conference  but will propose practical measures to alleviate hunger and malnutrition.  In Mauritius  we have adopted a comprehensive strategy to achieve a reasonable level of food self-sufficiency. We are mobilizing technological  financial and human resources to produce locally as much food as is practically possible. To this end  we have set up a one-billion-rupee Food Security Fund to optimize efficiency and boost agricultural production.  To benefit from economies of scale  we are encouraging production in surplus of local consumption for export. We are establishing partnerships regionally to jointly produce food crops  livestock and marine products. The effective implementation of this strategy will contribute to improving our national food security.  We are currently working with Mozambique on a rice production project which will contribute to improving food availability in both countries  and probably in the region.  Climate change poses an existential challenge to mankind. Our profligacy puts at stake the very future of our planet and the forms of life it supports. This is an environmental threat with far-reaching social and economic implications that we have yet to mainstream into our national planning and decision-making processes.  We cannot with impunity treat our home planet with contempt. We can yet forestall bringing upon ourselves the full wrath of nature. But time is running out. Divergences must be resolved at all costs  and quickly  at Copenhagen. To move forward in a pragmatic manner  we need to break away from the finger-pointing  recrimination and brinkmanship of the past.  In Copenhagen  it is imperative that we agree to a targeted reduction in greenhouse gas emissions that will restrict global temperature rise to no more than 1.5° C. But any action  to be fair  must be proportional. Those who have polluted the most should bear most of the burden. Developing countries need extra help so that their growth path is not thwarted.  We must create a financial mechanism to assist developing countries to adapt to and mitigate the effects of climate change. This mechanism has to be credible and sustainable  and be managed according to the principles of good governance. It should also be a channel for the transfer of technology.  I therefore make a strong appeal that we unite to act collectively and quickly in our own interest and that of future generations.  For its part  Mauritius is implementing the “Maurice île durable” project to respond to climate change and the energy crisis. This is an ambitious programme focusing on the use of renewable energy and the emergence of small power producers. Its implementation will reduce our dependence on fossil fuels considerably and facilitate the transition to a clean  energy-efficient economy.  We have mobilized appropriate resources  with the collaboration of the private sector and development partners  to build a green and ecological future for Mauritius. We are doing our utmost to contribute  in full measure  to the global effort required.  The inherent constraints faced by small island developing States (SIDS) — in particular limited resources  remoteness  small domestic markets and vulnerability to natural disasters — cannot be ignored. We share a common future  and the welfare of one is unsustainable without the welfare of all.  We appeal to the international community to be more forthcoming in assisting SIDS in their efforts to become integrated into the global economy. A one-size-fits-all approach to development threatens to further marginalize SIDS in an increasingly globalized world. It is patently obvious that SIDS deserve special treatment and need to be recognized as a group of countries having specificities of their own.  The promotion and protection of human rights is a key priority of my Government. I wish to extend our appreciation to the United Nations membership for the re-election of Mauritius to the Human Rights Council. We will continue to work with other members of the Council in a spirit of dialogue  cooperation and objectivity to ensure that human rights violations are effectively addressed.   43 09-52463   In line with our commitment to see that perpetrators of grave human rights violations are brought to justice  we wish to reaffirm our unflinching support for the International Criminal Court (ICC).  At the national level  we have adopted legislation such as the Equal Opportunities Act and the Truth and Justice Commission Act to further entrench human rights. Our achievements in the field of human rights were widely acknowledged during the Universal Periodic Review conducted earlier this year by the Human Rights Council. We were gratified by the unique opportunity provided to us by the Review to make a critical self-assessment of the situation in Mauritius.  When I addressed the Assembly in September 2007 I called on the international community to do more than just stand by the people of Burma. This appeal is more than ever relevant. We cannot condone the condemnation of Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi by a kangaroo court. We reaffirm our solidarity with and support for Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi  an emblematic lady who personifies the courage and dignity of her people  a people battered and bruised but unbowed.   It is imperative that we convey a clear and strong signal to the military junta that the international community will not tolerate its confiscation of the Burmese people’s sovereignty. In this respect  I welcome the recent decision of the EU to extend the sanctions imposed on Burma.  For its part  Mauritius will continue to implement the decision I took in 1997 to suspend importations of rice from Burma. This decision has a cost  but it is a price we are prepared to pay in defence of principles we hold dear. We must show the world that there will be no double standards in our approach. I urge those countries that give comfort and sustenance to the regime not to let their short-term  mercantile interests perpetuate the misery of this long-suffering people.  The Arab-Israeli conflict  with the question of Palestine at its core  remains an issue of deep concern not only to the region  but also to the world at large. We take heart in the efforts of the Administration of President Obama to impart new impetus to the Middle East peace process. And we could not agree more with President Obama that continuing to build new settlements flies in the face of logic if lasting peace is to be achieved.  As a long-time proponent of a two-State solution  Mauritius welcomes the Quartet’s commitment  renewed in Trieste in June  to actively and vigorously work for a comprehensive solution of the Arab-Israeli conflict.  The Arab League’s commitment to peace with Israel and the Arab Peace Initiative have been encouraging developments. We hope that those most directly concerned will display the courage and maturity to engage in meaningful dialogue in earnest.  The United Nations is  more than ever  the ultimate guardian of mankind’s aspiration to global peace and security. I salute its unceasing effort in resolving conflicts around the world  in particular on the African continent. Conflicts and insecurity in Africa have been a major cause of the continent’s underdevelopment. A study carried out by Oxfam last year indicates that between 1990 and 2005 conflict cost the continent $300 billion  which is almost equivalent to all the international aid received by sub-Saharan Africa during that period.  The African Union has moved ahead with the creation of an African Standby Force. Once fully established  the Force will  hopefully  help in the advancement of peace and security at the continental level. The creation of the Mechanism for Conflict Prevention  Management and Resolution is also a positive step in improving the peace and security architecture of Africa.  I take this opportunity to commend the United Nations and the European Union for helping Africa enhance its capacity to respond adequately and in a timely manner to security threats on the continent. The European Union deserves our appreciation for its contribution  to the tune of €500 million under the 10th European Development Fund  for the implementation of the Africa Peace Facility.  Allow me also to highlight some of the progress that has been achieved on the continent this year  including the formation of an all-inclusive Government in Zimbabwe and the holding of presidential elections in Mauritania.  We welcome the Agreement of Goodwill and Confidence-Building for the Settlement of the Problem in Darfur reached in February by Sudan’s Government of National Unity and the Justice and Equality Movement.     09-52463 44   We commend the role played by the African Union-United Nations joint mediation team and particularly the Government of Qatar  which has done so much to drive the process. We call on all the parties to the conflict to join in the search for peace in Darfur. We hope that conditions will speedily be created for the return of refugees and internally displaced persons.  We have high expectations that the preliminary agreement reached in Maputo will provide the political framework for resolution of the troubled situation in Madagascar. We are heartened by the active involvement and solicitude of various international bodies in trying to return the country to constitutional order. We cannot and should not condone unconstitutional Governments anywhere  be it in Honduras or Madagascar.  Somalia reminds us that we cannot with impunity wash our hands of any country  however remote it may be or however unimportant it may seem. The international community’s neglect of the country and its indifference to the suffering of the Somali people have resulted in a quintessential failed State. That neglect and indifference have come back to haunt us in the form of piracy. Armed bands led by warlords have filled the political vacuum left by the deliquescence of the Somali State. Today the territory of Somalia provides not only a haven for pirates  but also a base for terrorist groups. The Transitional Federal Government has to be assisted to regain control of the country  to put an end to the suffering of the Somali people and to deal with the problem of piracy.  Terrorism is an insidious  tentacular malignancy — a bane of our times. It is not only a security threat. It is a moral challenge  the negation of the fundamental values of civilization: the sanctity of human life and the intrinsic worth of the human person.  Every terrorist attack causes us pain  anguish and revulsion. But the one in Mumbai last November took on a special poignancy for the people of Mauritius. In the blind and mindless carnage unleashed by the terrorists on that city  one of the victims was a compatriot of ours. We have condemned in no uncertain terms this dastardly  cowardly act  and we expect that everything will be done to ensure that the terrorist organization behind it is brought to justice. My Government unreservedly supports all campaigns and initiatives against terrorism.  Mauritius nurtures the hope of the complete elimination of all nuclear weapons one day. Pending its ultimate realization  we support all measures aimed at halting the further spread of such weapons. In this regard  we welcome the comprehensive agenda of President Obama to achieve the goal of a world without nuclear weapons.  Multilateralism is the cornerstone of the United Nations  and should be strengthened in the face of the current global challenges. Global challenges need a global response.  We follow with keen interest the process under way to revitalize the General Assembly and improve its working methods  to bring more coherence to the United Nation system  and to reform the Security Council.  We are particularly satisfied by the start of the intergovernmental negotiations on Security Council reform earlier this year in an informal plenary session of the General Assembly. The comity of nations should work together  in a spirit of solidarity  to reach a unified position on the reform of this important body. The reform of the Council should cover the categories of both permanent and non-permanent members  with a revised set of working methods.  We fully support India’s having a permanent seat in a reformed Security Council. And we once again express our unequivocal support for the Common African Position. We also support permanent membership of a Latin American and Caribbean country in a reformed Security Council.  I take this opportunity to reaffirm the sovereignty of Mauritius over the Chagos Archipelago  including Diego Garcia  which was detached by the United Kingdom from the territory of Mauritius prior to our independence. The dismemberment of the territory of Mauritius was in total disregard of General Assembly resolutions 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960 and 2066 (XX) of 16 December 1965.  As President Obama said two days ago from this very rostrum  we must “demonstrate that international law is not an empty promise” (). We must all abide by it.  We have consistently urged the United Kingdom to engage in a meaningful dialogue with Mauritius for the early return of the Chagos Archipelago. We are pleased to inform the Assembly that two rounds of   45 09-52463  talks have been held with the United Kingdom this year. We look forward to those discussions coming to fruition  and hope that Mauritius will be able to exercise its sovereignty over the Chagos Archipelago  including Diego Garcia  in the near future.  My Government and the French authorities are also in the process of addressing the issue of Tromelin. We are discussing the modalities of co-management of the island in a spirit of friendship and trust  pending the settlement of the sovereignty issue  which has to be resolved and not left on the back burner. (spoke in French)  Nobody can deny the key role that the United Nations is called upon to play in the concert of nations. At the same time  we agree that the Organization needs to be reformed. The attendance at this session of the Assembly  where each year a number of points of view and perceptions converge  emphasizes our desire to act and build together.   The concerns and aspirations of our peoples are echoed and thus take on universal resonance. We are indeed becoming aware that  whatever latitude we develop in  we have a common destiny.  I am one of a people steeped in several cultures  whose men and women worship Shiva  Jesus  Allah and Buddha  in diverse languages. The history of the  populating of our island and its geographical position have made our country a true crossroads of cultures. We have made the right to difference on the one hand and the right to equality on the other our watchwords. I am happy to remind my multi-ethnic people that each individual shares with all other humans 99.9 per cent of the same genetic code.  Those of us gathered here have much to learn from each other. Exchanging our experiences and knowledge enriches us and makes us stronger.  The respect for plurality that this forum demands must neither make us forget our differences nor contribute to the emergence of a dominant discourse.   I commend the topic that the President has chosen for this year. If the Assembly manages to foster cross-pollenization of cultures and to highlight what human beings have in common  we shall  to a large extent  have achieved our goal."
"123",4954,"MWI",64,2009,"I wish to add my voice to those who have spoken before me on the need for effective responses to global crises and for strengthening multilateralism and dialogue among civilizations for international peace  security and development.   I believe that there is no longer an excuse for world leaders to be reluctant to move closer together and stimulate debate on how multilateralism and dialogue could be strengthened. We need to strengthen collaboration so that the international community responds effectively to such global challenges as climate change  the financial and economic crisis  food and energy crises  armed conflicts  terrorism and  above all  poverty reduction.   The first item on the multilateralism agenda is to reach a global consensus on reforming multilateral institutions  including the United Nations  to ensure the equitable and geographical representation of developed and developing countries alike. It is imperative that developing nations have an effective voice on matters that concern them. Therefore  the United Nations should promote dialogue that ensures the inclusiveness  transparency and accountability that are needed to attain genuine global peace  security and development.  The Security Council must be made flexible to allow the countries of Africa  Asia  Latin America and the Middle East to have fair representation in that body. The continued monopoly of that body by the super-Powers is no longer justifiable. Developing nations cannot continue to be silent spectators in matters that affect them. Every sovereign nation is an integral part of the global village. Gone are the days when conflicts  wars and economic crises in Africa  South-East Asia  the Middle East and Latin America were the concerns only of the peoples and Governments in those areas.  The second agenda item for multilateral dialogue is the attainment of world food security. Food shortages threaten the foundations of democracy and good governance. The United Nations cannot sustain a world system where huge populations live permanently with hunger and starvation. This world body must find a formula whereby the world can produce enough food for all at affordable prices. I believe that it is possible under the auspices of the United Nations to achieve global food security.  Malawi has a well-organized agricultural development strategy and can contribute to United Nations efforts in this matter. Malawi has  within a short period of time  transformed itself from being a food-deficit and hungry nation to a food-surplus nation. Malawi now produces enough food for all its people  and we are able to export to neighbouring countries.  The key factor behind this success story is that Malawi has allocated huge budgetary resources and heavy investment to the agricultural sector. We have also successfully introduced an agricultural input subsidy programme that enables poor and low-income households to buy fertilizer  seeds and chemicals at a heavily subsidized price. As a result  poor smallholder farmers have become more productive. At the same time  there are visible signs of improvements in the standard of living of the people  particularly in rural areas.  The third agenda item for multilateral dialogue is to manage climate change. Malawi is happy that this matter will be fully discussed at the Copenhagen Conference later this year. At the national level  Malawi is responding to the challenge of climate change through intensive irrigation farming and by moving away from dependence on rain-fed agriculture. The Government has introduced the Green Belt programme that will irrigate up to 1 million hectares of land for small-  medium- and large-scale farmers by harnessing water sources from the rivers and lakes to provide extensive irrigation. We shall grow a broad range of food crops  such as rice  wheat  maize  beans and lentils  as our way to contribute to resolving the world food crisis.  The threat of climate change is real. I believe that the price of complacency will be much higher if we fail to act today. For Africa and developing countries elsewhere  we need to adequately address the issue of deforestation  environmental degradation and agricultural productivity. We need to act now.  Let me conclude by stating that we also need a global dialogue on democracy  good governance  human rights  the rule of law and the fight against terrorism in all its manifestations. We also need a new understanding of how developing nations can cope with the shocks of global financial crises and escalating fuel prices.  I believe that  working together  all nations of the world  rich or poor  powerful or powerless  can strengthen multilateralism and dialogue for lasting international peace  security and development. We live in one world. We have the same destiny. "
"124",5000,"MYS",64,2009,"I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Mr. Treki on his presidency and to assure him of Malaysia’s full support.  There is a difference in the General Assembly this year. In light of some of the greatest challenges ever faced by any generation  we have resolved to work more closely together  to strengthen the ties that bind us as members of a human family  to fulfil our responsibilities and to overcome distrust and discord. Malaysia will continue to do its part in this cooperative endeavour. We do so knowing that we are a country in the middle  not too large nor too small  not too rich nor too poor  not too strong nor too weak. We do our part knowing that our actions have consequences for ourselves and our children. We do so in the belief that hope will triumph over adversity.  I believe that the developing world is not shirking its responsibilities to address the entire spectrum of challenges facing us. But our efforts will be far more effective if done in tandem with the developed world. So allow me to say this on behalf of the developing world — give us fair terms and we will seal the deal. Give us the tools and we will help to finish the job. Invest in our common future  and all our children and humanity henceforth will reap the rewards.  A few days ago we deliberated on the issue of climate change  among the most pressing and urgent issues facing us today. Therefore  I hope that we are now more firm in our resolve to act immediately. In Malaysia’s case  we are  in the context of mitigation action  protecting and preserving our rainforests through sustainable forest management measures. We are increasing the use of public transportation as part of the relevant Ministry’s key performance indicator. We are also increasing the usage of renewable energy sources and promoting greater energy efficiency. The Ministry of Energy  Water and Communications has been transformed into the Ministry of Energy  Green Technology and Water.  However  it is the developed world that must play the leading role in the global effort to combat climate change. Sadly  such leadership has been lacking. Developed countries’ pledges to cut greenhouse gas emissions fall short of what is required to tackle increasing global temperatures.  We have to seal the deal in Copenhagen. However  that cannot be achieved if the developed world continues to attempt to reinterpret and renegotiate key principles of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol. Let me be absolutely clear about this: there will not be a deal in Copenhagen if some are keen to “steal the deal”.  I need to state what I believe to be a very important fact. Tackling climate change entails making difficult choices  given the competing interests of so many constituents and needs in developing countries. More important  there is a need to balance development  food security and poverty eradication  on the one hand  and environmental considerations  on the other. Let us not make the glib statement that one perfectly complements the other.  For example  agricultural production  the bedrock of efforts to address the food crisis  produces 14 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions. Let us not forget that the world food system is still in crisis. Although the prices of major food grains have declined since last year  they are still above average. Hunger afflicts more than 1 billion people. Addressing the food crisis requires more than increasing food production; it demands nothing less than a transformation of market systems so that they work better for the poorest and hungriest. It is for those reasons that we believe that climate change must not be treated as a stand-alone subject; it must be seen as part of the broader sustainable development challenge.  The United Nations has been in existence for more than 60 years  yet peace and security continue to elude us in many parts of the world. Malaysia has played and will continue to play its role in achieving global peace and security. We have committed our troops to United Nations peacekeeping operations since 1960.    09-52604 38   Closer to home  Malaysia has been playing a role in fostering peace within the Association of Southeast Asian Nations region. We are actively involved in peace efforts in the southern Philippines. We will continue to work towards greater progress in the democratization process in Myanmar.  Often  grave injustices are the cause of breaches of peace and threats to security. In that connection  we must accept the fact that the Palestinian issue epitomizes everything that is unjust and unfair in international relations. It has taken on a symbolic value that colours cultural and political relations well beyond its geographical scope. This issue has bedevilled the international community for too long. We must do all that we can to address the Palestinian issue  as resolving it will have a major impact in our efforts to achieve peace and security in the Middle East and beyond.  For far too long  the unstinting support given to Israel has resulted in an impasse. In the interest of global peace  Israel  Palestine and the affected countries in the region must work together to resolve the conflict. We look forward to the United States undertaking the role of an honest broker. We hold much hope for a more even-handed approach by the United States on the Middle East. We expect to be able to be part of a just and comprehensive solution and that the action of the United States will match its rhetoric. After all  history is littered with examples of the fury and vehemence that result when hope turns into despair.  Non-proliferation and disarmament are cornerstones of peace and security. We agree that at the heart of such efforts is a basic bargain comprising these elements: first  all nations have the right to peacefully use nuclear power; second  nations that have nuclear weapons must move towards disarmament; and third  those without nuclear weapons must renounce their acquisition.   In that regard  Malaysia draws hope from any action by major Powers such as the agreement between the United States and Russia to reduce their nuclear stockpiles. We also look forward to other measures to strengthen that bargain  including the strengthening of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and other international instruments related to disarmament and non-proliferation. By the same token  we view with grave concern any attempt aimed at the proliferation of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction.  For our part  since 1996  we have introduced the draft resolution on follow-up to the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice on the legality of the threat or use of nuclear weapons  and we will continue to do so at this session of the General Assembly. The resolution  inter alia  calls on all States to fulfil their obligation by commencing multilateral negotiations leading to an early conclusion of a nuclear weapons convention. Malaysia’s efforts in that regard will not cease here. We will also participate actively in the 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the NPT and play our rightful role as President of the Board of Governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency.  For many  efforts to achieve peace and security begin at a more commonplace level. Given Malaysia’s multi-ethnic and multi-religious society  we are especially conscious of the need to continuously promote interaction among peoples of different religions  races and beliefs. For that reason  the Malaysian Government has introduced the “one Malaysia” concept  which builds on previous efforts to promote national unity yet takes present realities into account. It aims to foster appreciation and respect for all races  seeing diversity as a source of strength. It envisages unity that arises from true acceptance instead of mere tolerance  based on the legal principles set out in the Constitution  and has social justice for all at its heart.   If our collective efforts to create a better world are to succeed  the global governance structure must be improved. Decisions are still made by the few for the many. The prime example of that is the Security Council. We continue to believe that reform of the Council  including the eventual abolition of the veto  is critical if the aspiration to the equality of States is to be fulfilled.   The same situation is reflected in the economic sphere. Perhaps the most important result of the recently concluded summit of the Group of 20 (G-20) is the Group’s designation as the premier forum for international economic cooperation. That point was made twice in the Leaders’ Statement. Further  G-20 representatives are to report back to their countries with recommendations on how to maximize the effectiveness of their cooperation.   39 09-52604   It may be said that the G-20 is far more representative than the Group of Eight  given the participation of the leading emerging economies. However  questions remain as to how representative and inclusive it truly is. Therefore  the challenge of the G-20 process is how best to make it more legitimate and more effective.  I would like to make the following points and proposals in this regard. First  many of the main thrusts of the G-20’s work  such as reform of the Bretton Woods institutions and strengthening the international financial regulatory system  were first articulated by Malaysia in the wake of the Asian financial crisis. Secondly  while claiming no particular credit for Malaysia  that means that ideas and solutions are not the monopoly of the large and powerful. Thirdly  the choice between legitimacy and effectiveness is often a false one. Fourthly  in addressing ways of maximizing cooperation among themselves  the G-20 must simultaneously address ways of improving links with the broader international community. Finally  there needs to be greater clarity on the involvement of regional organizations.  On the issue of global governance  as in many others  Malaysia stands ready  willing and able to make a meaningful contribution. We aspire to equality for all States  large and small. We dream a dream of a true Parliament of Man  a Federation of the World.  But we are not content to be idle dreamers. We intend to make full use our presidency of the Economic and Social Council next year to address these issues. We will do so in a cooperative and action-oriented manner. History has shown that a state of virtue or vice is often the result of human endeavour and activity. Vices that have existed since time immemorial have been eradicated by dint of human action. Slavery is one such example  apartheid another. Inspired by the hope that these examples provide  I believe that we can yet overcome the grave challenges that we face. However  there must be a willingness to collectively bear our common burdens.  I would therefore like to end where I began  with an expression of hope that in the light of some of the greatest challenges ever faced by any generation of Man  we will finally be able to work more closely. This hope is that we may strengthen the ties that bind us as members of a human family  fulfil our responsibilities and overcome distrust and discord."
"125",5027,"NAM",64,2009,"I would like to congratulate the President on his unanimous election to preside over the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. We are confident that he will discharge the responsibilities of that office with honour and dignity  given his track record and experience. I wish to assure him of Namibia’s support and cooperation to ensure that his tenure in office is crowned with success. In the same vein  I wish to commend His Excellency Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann for the able manner in which he presided over the Assembly at its sixty-third session. I equally wish to express our sincere appreciation to the Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon  for his tireless efforts in leading our Organization to respond effectively to the large number of challenges and pressing issues facing humanity.  We are meeting today at a very challenging time. The impact of the world financial and economic crisis on our countries and economies is very severe. This crisis is a major concern that requires concerted efforts to search for effective methods of coping with it  in order to mitigate its impact and to achieve sustainable growth and development. This crisis is taking its toll on every aspect of our development and social life. The progress that we made in the fight against poverty  hunger and diseases  as well as in achieving the internationally agreed development goals  including the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  is threatened.  The financial crisis came in the middle of the food and energy crisis. Skyrocketing prices of basic foodstuffs  though said to have stabilized now  have left many households unable to put food on the table. Net food importing countries like Namibia had to divert resources from development to emergency relief  while importing high-priced food destabilized our balance of payments and State revenues.  The situation was also worsened by high fuel prices. Oil-importing developing countries like ours have been negatively affected by ever-increasing oil prices  which have also led to price increases in other sectors  as suppliers of goods and services raise prices to make up for production and transportation costs.   The financial and economic crisis  coupled with the food and energy crisis  has plunged the world into a global recession. The combination of these crises with climate change and its adverse impact on sustainable development is cause for great concern. Namibia  like many other developing countries  is an insignificant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Yet our country is one of the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. I therefore call upon major emitters to not only make drastic reductions in their greenhouse gas emissions  but also to use technology and financial resources to support the efforts of developing countries to adapt to the adverse effects of climate change. The Government of the Republic of Namibia fully supports the efforts of the Secretary-General to mobilize political will to ensure a good and legally binding agreement on climate change in Copenhagen this December.  Namibia is one of the countries with the highest socio-economic inequality in the world because of its colonial past. Nevertheless  the country has made progress in the provision of health  education and other critical services for the majority of the population  and we are on course to meet a number of the MDGs.  However  we face severe difficulties in responding to the combination of the devastating HIV/AIDS pandemic  high levels of food insecurity and poverty. I once again call upon the international community to increase support to our national programmes for sustainable economic and social development through measures such as market access and access to financial resources in the form of concessional loans and foreign direct investment flows.  The need for a strong and effective United Nations cannot be overemphasized. The process for the reform of the Organization should be expedited in order to deliver on its promises in the maintenance of international peace and security  respect for human rights  social and economic development and the protection of the environment.  There is an urgent need to reform the Security Council to make it more representative  democratic and accountable. Is it not an anomaly  and unjust  that Africa remains the only region without permanent representation on the Security Council? This does not reflect the continent’s vital role in the maintenance of global peace and security. The need for Africa to be equitably represented on the Council  with all the privileges associated with membership  remains our priority. In this regard  Namibia stands by the common   5 09-52598  African position on the reform of the United Nations as articulated in the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration.  Namibia welcomes the joint communiqué on strengthening the capacity of the African Union (AU) in peacekeeping operations  as agreed to by the United Nations Security Council and the African Union Peace and Security Council  as a step in the right direction. There is a need for more structured and formalized cooperation between the two bodies on issues of peace and security in Africa. Such cooperation should also include the areas of financing  logistics  transfer of technology and training. Furthermore  there is a need for the United Nations to support the AU position of principle on not recognizing Governments that come to power through military coups. Namibia calls upon the General Assembly to urgently pass a resolution prohibiting the participation of such Governments in the activities of all United Nations institutions.  The right of all people to self-determination is a fundamental human right  which is enshrined in the United Nations Charter. It is deplorable that almost 10 years into the twenty-first century colonialism is still an issue with which this Organization has to deal.  My delegation has raised its voice repeatedly in this Assembly  calling for the realization of the inalienable rights of the people of Western Sahara to self-determination. The international community has an obligation to assist the people of Western Sahara in their quest for freedom and independence. Namibia therefore calls for the immediate and unconditional implementation of the United Nations Settlement Plan for Western Sahara and of all resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly  with the aim of holding a free and fair referendum in Western Sahara.  Similarly  Namibia is deeply concerned about the continuing suffering of the people of Palestine under Israeli occupation. We wish to reaffirm our full and unequivocal support for the inalienable rights of the people of Palestine to self-determination  including the return to their land. I wish to again call upon the parties to resume the peace process on the basis of all relevant United Nations resolutions.  My delegation wishes to reiterate its long-held position on the unilateral economic  commercial and financial blockade imposed against Cuba. We believe that the blockade constitutes a violation of international law and the rights of the people of Cuba. Its extraterritorial nature impedes free trade and economic development. Furthermore  it undermines the efforts of the international community to attain the internationally agreed development goals  as it affects that country’s economy adversely and subjects its people to untold pain and suffering.   We urge the Government of the United States of America to heed the call of the international community and to implement the resolutions of the General Assembly that call for an end to the blockade. Namibia wishes to reaffirm its solidarity with and support of Cuba’s call for the immediate release of the five Cuban nationals detained in the United States of America.  I would like to seize this opportunity to express our deep appreciation to the Governments and international organizations that responded in a timely manner to our appeal for support and assistance following the devastating floods that my country has experienced during the past two years. That assistance has greatly contributed to the alleviation of the suffering of those in the affected areas.  Finally  I wish to call upon all States Members of the United Nations  in keeping with their responsibilities and obligations under the United Nations Charter  to fully address the challenges facing humankind today in order to make the world a better place for all and where we can all live together in peace  security and true justice."
"126",5072,"NER",64,2009,"The delegation of the Niger — which I have the honour to lead and which brings the message of His Excellency Mamadou Tandja  President of the Republic — is more than pleased to see you  Mr. President  presiding over the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. Your election  which the Niger welcomes with pride  is without a doubt both recognition and endorsement of your exceptional abilities as a seasoned diplomat  which you have demonstrated throughout your distinguished career. We in the Niger are well placed to attest to your commitment to the cause of Africa and of our common subregion  specifically through the Community of Sahel-Saharan States  that other forum in which our countries work together for the same goals that are enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. Thus we consider ourselves to be in your good hands  ready to advance the work of the Organization in this time of formidable challenges.  I should like to renew our congratulations to the outgoing President  Father Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann  on his active and very full presidency  and to state that the Niger was honoured to serve alongside him in its capacity as Vice-President at the sixty-third session.  On behalf of the Niger  I should like to reiterate our profound gratitude to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his unflagging efforts to make the United Nations a more just and effective Organization  able to meet the expectations of its Members.  My delegation welcomes your decision  Sir  to declare as the very apt theme for the Assembly’s current session the strengthening of multilateralism and dialogue among civilizations for international peace  security and development. In our view  this theme has the potential to spur Member States to greater initiative in realizing the goals that we are pursuing  namely  those of preserving international peace and security. We are pleased  in this regard  by the renewed dynamism in cooperation between the Security Council and regional organizations  in particular the African Union. We believe that this direction has the potential   27 09-52598  to lead to lasting solutions to the problems of peace and security in Africa.  We are convinced that such cooperation will yield results even on the most delicate issues  such as the implementation of the political-legal concept of the principle of universal jurisdiction. While my delegation welcomes the inclusion of this topic in the agenda of the General Assembly  we should like once again to endorse the concerns already expressed by the African Union and to urge Member States to avoid using this principle inappropriately. We hope that our debate in this common forum will make possible a better understanding of this concept and a better definition of the framework governing its eventual application.  We note the progress that is being made in various areas in the prevention and management of conflicts  both in Africa and elsewhere. And we welcome the commitment and goodwill of all parties carrying out concerted actions to ensure international peace and security.  The recommendations of the special summit on conflict prevention and management held in Tripoli reflect the will of African leaders to take on issues that have always slowed our continent in its march towards progress and prosperity. It is at this level that the theme of multilateralism — which you  Mr. President  have selected for the sixty-fourth session — takes on all its meaning. Indeed  the United Nations  as the common framework enjoying the highest level of participation by countries and other actors in the world  should serve as a laboratory in which we work towards the goal of a more balanced international community.  Governed as it is by the laws of globalization  the current international scene is  as we know  much more complex today than in the past. We must address and manage the consequences of the international financial crisis and  for countries in the Sahel such as the Niger  the recurrent effects of food insecurity. We must address climate change in a concerted and coordinated manner  and we must constantly question the current formulas for preventing conflict and maintaining international peace and security.   My delegation supports such initiatives  which must be inclusive  because they must benefit from the contributions and perspectives of everyone  including the most vulnerable countries. In particular  we support the various discussions under way on this subject  whether in the General Assembly  the Economic and Social Council or the Security Council  or even in the context of specific initiatives such as the discussions being held by Canada on peacekeeping operations.  We in the Niger have made undeniable progress in the area of combating poverty and promoting basic development  thanks to the bold actions of the President. Through projects designed specifically to meet the needs of Niger’s people  he has enabled our country to finally give meaning to development. Today  development is palpable in every corner of the Niger because of proactive and systematic efforts to build classrooms and health clinics  dig wells  build local drinking water systems and promote a microcredit system designed specifically for the most vulnerable rural women. The head of State is doing this to improve the living conditions of our people  who suffered from the political instability that characterized our country during the 1990s  which one could describe as a lost decade for Niger’s development. In late August  a meeting was held in Niamey for the second 2009 review by the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility of the International Monetary Fund. The Niger’s performance in those areas was acknowledged and commended at the meeting  which brought together representatives of the World Bank and of our country’s Ministry of Economy and Finance.  I recall these aspects of the situation in Niger because  as members are aware  a referendum was held in our country on 4 August 2009 to adopt a new constitution. It formalizes the return to a presidential Administration more suited to the realities of our country and introduces new provisions such as that establishing two chambers  Parliament and the Senate. The referendum  held in an atmosphere of calm and transparency by the National Independent Electoral Commission  enabled us to adopt the new constitution  which formalizes the arrival of the sixth Republic.   Therefore  I wish to take this opportunity to reassure the international community  development partners  civil society and other actors and entities that may be justifiably concerned about the political situation in the Niger that the country is not in a situation of lawlessness or insurrection  as some would have one believe  but rather is a place where all people freely express their opinions within the framework of the democratic process  to which we are deeply committed.    09-52598 28   The sovereign people of the Niger have chosen to refashion the Republic around certain values with which they identify. In this new endeavour  President Mamadou Tandja has solemnly pledged that no group or structure will be overlooked. Following the referendum  the President recalled his willingness to work with all citizens of the Niger in the interest of the country and its people. The forthcoming legislative elections  to be held on 20 October  and the municipal elections in December 2009 will be opportunities for large-scale mobilization to ensure better representation for the people in the conduct of State affairs. It is this reality of a Niger marching towards development  resolutely committed to building its future and more determined than ever to lift its people out of poverty  that we must bear in mind.  We fully support any joint action that can contribute to general and complete disarmament. We have been at the forefront in fulfilling our commitments in this area  and we are resolved to continue to work in that regard within our modest means. Our most recent initiative was to ratify the Convention on Cluster Munitions on 14 May 2009 — a formality that made the Niger one of the very first countries to do so and accelerated its entry into force. We believe that this gesture  although it may seem minor  assumes its full meaning in the context of the difficult path towards complete disarmament. For us  this initiative  together with our country’s ratification of the Convention on Small Arms and Light Weapons  Their Ammunition and Other Related Materials  adopted by the Economic Community of West African States  is a significant contribution to disarmament at our level.  We are following the various processes carried out at various levels to reform the United Nations system. This includes reform of the Security Council  with regard to which we call for greater recognition of Africa’s role through the Ezulwini Consensus; the ongoing preparations to ensure the success of the United Nations climate change conference in Copenhagen; and the summit convened by the Secretary-General and just concluded here in New York  which benefited from the valuable guidance of heads of State and Government. In addition  there is United Nations system-wide coherence; the definition of the new concept of the responsibility to protect  which needs to be clearly defined and set out  as in the Constitutive Act of the African Union; and  finally  the follow-up to the outcome document of the Conference on the World Financial and Economic Crisis and Its Impact on Development  which the previous President of the General Assembly wished to begin by appointing facilitators.  With regard to all those issues and many other important concerns  such as those referred to in the outcome document of the Follow-up International Conference on Financing for Development to Review the Implementation of the Monterrey Consensus  held at Doha at the end of 2008  we wish to express once again our ongoing concern that we should develop an inclusive and transparent approach at all levels that takes into account the concerns of both large and small countries.   We are following with great interest  and often concern  the progress of the commitments made within the framework of the Millennium Development Goals  and we note that it remains mixed. At the same time  adverse phenomena are placing constraints on both developed and developing countries  such as the world economic and financial crisis. These problems now require that all of us redouble our efforts to keep our commitments. In that regard  we will closely follow the preparations for the 2010 mid-term review conference  which  we hope  will result in efforts to accelerate the attainment of the agreed objectives. We also take this opportunity to reaffirm the irreplaceable nature of the New Partnership for Africa’s Development as a relevant African initiative that must enjoy the support of the United Nations and of the international community as a whole.   We welcome the decision to convene the Fourth United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries  and we salute the host country  Turkey  for its generous initiative vis-à-vis our group of countries. We also thank other countries and partner organizations which have always remained sensitive to the many constraints and concerns of our countries. We also know that  if significant progress has been made in 10 years in recognizing our difficult conditions and establishing useful partnerships in that regard  it is thanks to the coordination of the Office of the High Representative for the Least Developed Countries  Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States. We thank him for his initiatives  which remain essential for least developed and landlocked countries in the Sahel  such as the Niger.    29 09-52598   I should also like to express my Government’s appreciation to the President of the General Assembly for his decision to devote part of this session to the subject of the dialogue among cultures and civilizations. We believe that that issue is worthy of much attention and of action throughout the sixty-fourth session. Indeed  we must maintain the momentum begun by eminent Member States through the Third Ministerial Meeting on Interfaith Dialogue and Cooperation for Peace  held in 2008; the High-Level Dialogue on Interreligious and Intercultural Understanding and Cooperation for Peace; and the international conference on dialogue among civilizations and cultural diversity  held from 2 to  4 June 2009 in Kairouan  Tunisia. We must develop these initiatives  for which my delegation reiterates its congratulations to the Governments of the countries concerned.   Along the same lines  my delegation applauds the Government of the Philippines  which has decided to organize a special meeting at the ministerial level for the countries of the Non-Aligned Movement  under the theme “Interreligious Dialogue and Cooperation for Peace and Development”  from 1 to 3 December 2009 in Manila. That shows that the theme continues to draw the interest of many States and that you  Mr. President  were aptly inspired in identifying it as a topic of interest for the international community.  I would like to conclude my statement by renewing my delegation’s delight at the direction that you  Sir  have suggested for the current Assembly session and by reiterating our full confidence in your leadership  which promises a very fruitful and dynamic term in the pursuit of common objectives of the international community. As always  you can count on the unflagging support and readiness of the Government of the Niger throughout your term. "
"127",5118,"NGA",64,2009,"On behalf of the Nigerian delegation  I wish to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki on his election as the President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. I have no doubt that the Assembly will benefit from his wealth of experience and wisdom. Let me therefore affirm the full support and solidarity of my country. Similarly  I wish to commend the President of the Assembly at its sixty-third session  His Excellency Father Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann  for the able and effective manner with which he conducted the affairs of that session.  Last year when we gathered here  we were hopeful that the world would soon put behind it the devastating impact of the various global crises in the energy  agriculture and financial sectors. However  in spite of the efforts by the international community  the developing world is yet to experience any serious relief. There is no doubt that more than ever before the international community needs to fulfil its commitments to the developing world if more than half of humanity is to avoid an imminent calamity.   In this connection we welcome and applaud the efforts of the United Nations  in particular the outcome of the United Nations Conference on the World Financial and Economic Crisis and its Impact on Development held in New York last June . We call for the support and implementation of the recommendations of the conference and hope they will receive the unconditional support of the developed nations.  Equally important is the need for global efforts to boost food security. We need to increase food production  whether for domestic consumption or for export  which requires collaboration among investors  organizations and Governments. It is relevant here to reiterate our call for the removal of the enormous agricultural subsidies that developed countries continue to give their farmers  a practice that defies the logic of a free market economy and remains unfair to millions of poor peasant farmers across the world.  As we approach the countdown to 2015  a convergence of many factors  including the global economic crisis  is threatening not only the achievement of the targets for the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  but also the substantial gains already made. Unless we act fast  our dream of lifting the vast majority of humanity out of extreme poverty  hunger and disease will remain an illusion. Donors and recipient countries alike should make more effort to fulfil their commitments under the programme. For our part  we are determined to do all we can in order to attain the MDG targets  and we are calling on the international community to continue to provide support.  The African Summit on Roll Back Malaria  which was held in Abuja in 2000  adopted the Abuja Declaration and the Plan of Action to reduce malaria by 50 per cent in Africa by 2010. To achieve this goal  African countries affected by malaria were expected to devote 15 per cent of their public expenditures to the health sector.  Although considerable efforts have been made by the affected countries  as well as by donor agencies  the goal of Roll Back Malaria has not been realized. Malaria remains by far the biggest killer disease for    09-52604 42  children under 5-years old in Africa. This should weigh heavy on the global conscience.  Africa is committed to the goal of eliminating malaria  and to this end  Nigeria intends to host the Abuja-Plus Ten Summit on Roll Back Malaria in 2011. We would therefore appreciate the support of the Secretary-General  not only to make the proposed summit possible  but also to facilitate the realization of its objective.  The quality of participation at the just concluded 2009 Summit on Climate Change was a testimony to the global realization that climate change has truly become seen as a genuine existential threat to humanity. I commend the Secretary-General for his consistent engagement with this most important issue of our time  and call on all Member States to rededicate themselves to reversing the worst effects of this phenomenon.  For us in Africa  as the continent where  unfortunately  15 of the world’s 20 countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change are situated  we hope that the outcome of the fifteenth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change coming up in Copenhagen later this year will be an acceptable response to this global threat.  Even in the middle of this tale of global economic and financial woes  there is a silver lining. We are gratified and greatly encouraged by the increasing rapprochement between the United States and Russia on nuclear disarmament. The idea of a nuclear-free world  the architecture of which is now being put together  has great appeal for many of us.  Such an outcome  probably achievable in our lifetime  would not only result in a safer and better world  but would free resources for use in sectors that would benefit humanity. Nigeria encourages all nuclear Powers to identify with this great initiative  this dream  and to embrace any and all initiatives that promote the achievement of the goal of a world free of nuclear armaments and the apocalyptic nightmare.  It is in this connection that Nigeria applauds the conclusion and bringing into force of the Pelindaba Treaty  the African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty  which bans the testing  manufacturing  stockpiling  acquisition and possession of nuclear weapons in Africa. This is a commendable testimony to Africa’s total rejection of the proliferation  and indeed the existence  of nuclear weapons. We call on all other regions to follow suit. The Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons coming up next year provides an opportunity that should not be missed.  While we applaud this development  let us not forget that there are weapons still being produced that have killed far more people than nuclear arms in the tragic history of humanity. I speak  in particular  about the production of small arms and light weapons and their illicit export to regions like my own  Nigeria and West Africa  where these small arms and light weapons have become the real weapons of mass destruction — destroying many lives of innocent children  men and women  destroying property  economies and dreams — as well as the undermining of national and regional efforts at development.  We are all aware of the close link between such weapons and organized crime  drug trafficking and  in the case of Nigeria  piracy and oil smuggling in the Niger Delta. The proliferation of such weapons in West Africa is fast turning the region into a major transit point for illicit drugs  thus also facilitating the growth of criminal syndicates  some with enough firepower to challenge a nation’s military forces. This cannot be just a West African problem. It should be seen as a global threat.  This is why we continue to call on the international community to demonstrate greater commitment to keeping this threat in check by implementing existing initiatives  as well as developing new and legally binding ones  where necessary  geared towards achieving the goal of preventing  combating and eradicating illicit trade in small arms  and regulating the transfer of conventional weapons in general. The full implementation of the United Nations Programme on Small Arms would be a very good beginning.  Although over the past decade  West Africa has made considerable progress by way of building or strengthening democratic structures in our various countries  the job is far from done  and this is not the time to rest on our laurels. Peace and security challenges remain daunting in some parts of the subregion. As current Chairperson of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)  the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria    43 09-52604  Mr. Alhaji Umaru Yar’Adua sent a special envoy  in fact a former Head of State  the former President of Nigeria  to President Mamadou Tandja of the Republic of Niger with a view to establishing a line of communication with him in favour of a peaceful resolution of the political problems of our esteemed neighbour to the north. A delegation of ECOWAS Foreign Ministers undertook a similar visit with the same objective. Our role is largely mediatory  but we are waiting with cautious optimism for the democratic imperative in the Republic of the Niger to be upheld.  The situation in Guinea-Bissau is somewhat more cheerful. Guinea-Bissau held successful elections last July and  as members may already be aware  President Malam Bacai Sanhá was sworn in on 8 September. Because of the strong commitment on the part of all stakeholders in Guinea-Bissau  this peaceful transition to democratic  constitutional rule has taken place. We are indeed very proud of what the Government and the people of Guinea-Bissau have been able to achieve. Guinea-Bissau can now look forward with hope to a peaceful and bright future  and Nigeria will continue to stand side by side with that country as it charts its destiny for the future.  In Guinea-Conakry  where elections have again been slated for next January  we continue to impress on the authorities the need for the country to return to democratic rule through manifestly transparent  free and fair elections. We hope that these efforts will yield dividends in the form of an elected civilian government early next year. Our own experience and history in Nigeria leave us with no other choice than to remain unwaveringly and unambiguously on the side of the consolidation and maturation of constitutional democracy and to strongly repudiate even the slightest prospect of democratic reversal in the subregion. It is our national interest to do so.   ECOWAS has proven over and over again its willingness and capacity to come to the aid of its members in their hour of need. In that spirit  we will continue to make our best efforts to ensure that peace and stability reign in the region and to facilitate the realization of the objectives implied in the Community’s name. We continue  as usual  to count on the support of the United Nations system.  Nigeria continues to make great strides in our efforts to build a peaceful  stable and prosperous nation  able to provide the best possible life for its citizens and able to fulfil its international commitments and obligations. We have made great progress in laying a solid foundation for democracy  and we are seeking to build on this foundation to grow an economy that will see Nigeria take its rightful place among the world’s economic powerhouses. However  there are challenges. Some we can deal with by ourselves. Others require the help  support and cooperation of our friends and allies and of the United Nations family.  Those who have been watching events in our country in the past few months will testify to the progress we have made in the Niger Delta in finding durable solutions to the political  social and environmental problems of one of the most strategically important regions of our country. Today  relative peace has returned to the Niger Delta  largely on the back of an amnesty deal which the Government and erstwhile militants forged and are implementing together. The return of peace to the region would provide the platform for meeting the aspirations of the people  as well as allowing the resumption of full economic activity there.  Nigeria is a signatory to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and to the majority of other international and regional human rights instruments  and we continue to remain focused and committed on the issue of human rights.   In our endeavour to overcome the constraints brought about by the present gap between our nation’s increasing demand for power to drive its development and the available supply  we join others in pursuit of reliable  cheap and environmentally friendly alternative sources of energy. In this regard  we are gratified by the support and assistance that we  as a non-nuclear State  continue to receive from the International Atomic Energy Agency in exploring alternative sources of electricity generation  as well as in the areas of radiation control  waste management and training. We will continue to collaborate closely with the Agency  as well as to rely on the assistance of our allies and friends.  Nigeria welcomes the ongoing reform and democratization of the United Nations system and notes the progress made in the intergovernmental negotiation process. We encourage all parties to continue the negotiations with renewed vigour with a view to achieving the desired objectives. Of particular importance to Nigeria is the enlargement and    09-52604 44  democratization of the Security Council. It is unacceptable that Africa  with 53 countries  is not represented in the permanent seat category of the Council. We call upon Member States to demonstrate the necessary political will to bring about the long-awaited reform  in order to make the Security Council more legitimate  more democratic and more transparent and inclusive.  Nigeria’s commitment to the United Nations and the international system has been demonstrated over the years. This commitment accords with the provisions of our Constitution  which enjoins us  inter alia  to promote international cooperation for the consolidation of universal peace and to promote respect for international law and treaty obligations. Our international behaviour has always been guided by those noble foreign policy objectives.  Nigeria has been the fourth-largest contributor in the world to peacekeeping operations  and the role we have played — and will continue to play — in peacekeeping in the subregion  the African continent and  with the United Nations  around the world is a clear testimony to our unflinching commitment to joining hands with others  especially the United Nations  in laying solid foundations upon which human prosperity can be built. This is why we welcome the new strategy by the United Nations to strengthen the partnership between troop-contributing countries and the United Nations  especially in the provision of adequate resources and the capacity to strengthen regional peacekeeping initiatives.  Finally  as usual  Nigeria will continue to draw on its vast experience and commitment in its efforts to contribute to the realization of the objectives and values of the United Nations. We assure all our allies and friends that Nigeria will continue to be a responsible global member of the United Nations  subscribing to all the norms  conventions and values of this human family and providing leadership  especially on issues concerning West Africa and indeed the rest of the world."
"128",5163,"NIC",64,2009,"Thirty years after the triumph of the people’s Sandinista Revolution and the start of a process of popular and participatory democracy  on behalf of the President of Nicaragua and Commander of the Revolution  Mr. Daniel Ortega Saavedra  I salute and congratulate you  Mr. President  on your election as   09-53165 8  President of this Assembly  which it is my honour to address.  Nicaragua is a country impoverished by historical circumstances no different from  if not identical to  the histories and circumstances of countries of our Latin American and Caribbean region and others around the world. This history has been repeated over time and space  as we will outline later. Nevertheless  Nicaragua remains a land rich in beauty and natural resources. It is a nation symbolic of reconciliation and of national and international unity.  Although few may know this  our country is one of the safest countries of this continent. Nicaragua is engaged in an exemplary  tireless and decisive campaign against organized and petty crime in an exemplary fashion  as acknowledged by international bodies and authorities. It does so not only with coercive and punitive measures  but  more significantly  by building an alternative model of development that transforms the structures of poverty and marginalization that are the breeding ground of public security problems. Our model is based on democratic reform expressed by the people’s will  which we call “citizen power”.  By means of the “From Martí to Fidel” campaign  illiteracy has been reduced to 3.16 per cent. We have made progress in preventive medicine and have successfully controlled pandemics  such as that of the A (H1N1) virus. In our country  the mortality rate from this disease is one of the two lowest in America. These achievements have been made possible by the generous solidarity of the fraternal people and Government of Cuba  which has been consistent and has perpetuated the internationalist calling of Commander Fidel Castro Ruz.  The Government of Nicaragua has opened the door to production credits. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) selected our school nutrition programme as one of the top four in the world. In that spirit  President Daniel Ortega has proposed the adoption of a Central American agriculture policy to transform the region into a food production zone  and in that same spirit  we welcome and support the World Summit on Food Security scheduled for November of this year.  Today  we have an electrical power reserve of 42.6 per cent  although barely two years ago there was a shortfall of 3.29 per cent. This is thanks to the solidarity of the Bolivarian Government of Venezuela under the leadership of its President  Commander Hugo Chávez Frías. Meanwhile  we continue to make targeted efforts to promote the use of alternative renewable energy sources  such as water  wind  geothermal  solar power and  more recently  biomass. We also support initiatives aimed at developing civilian nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.  Clean drinking water has been made available to 217 000 families. We have launched programmes such as Zero Hunger and Zero Usury  which were highlighted in a report by the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the right to food. In order to refute the daily lies of certain media outlets in Nicaragua  FAO recently issued a published notice of the positive results of the programmes it coordinates with the Nicaraguan Government to fight hunger and extreme poverty.  Food security cannot continue to be subject to the greediness of a few. There is enough food to nourish twice the current world population  but thousands die every minute around the world. While in some countries automobiles are fed  millions of boys and girls die with an empty stomach. That is simply criminal.  We also express our profound rejection of the discrimination and persecution of immigrants and unequivocally support full respect for their human rights. The Government of National Reconciliation and Unity also seeks to reverse the exclusion to which native peoples and communities of African descent have been subject throughout history.  Nicaragua is the enemy of terrorism in any of its forms  including State-sponsored terrorism. It is for that and many other reasons that we oppose the criminal embargo against the heroic people of Cuba  six generations of whom have been born since the embargo began. How many more generations must outlive it? How many more resolutions must the Assembly adopt on this topic? There are already 17 resolutions on this issue.  It is also rightfully of interest to this Assembly that  while a criminal murderer of Cuban athletes enjoys total liberty  five anti-terrorist Cubans are imprisoned far from their families and incommunicado for the sole crime of simply being anti-terrorists.   9 09-53165   Today’s Nicaragua is an active militant in favour of solidarity  as well as a militant supporter of gratitude. We therefore appreciate the disinterested cooperation of the sister nations that contribute to the economic and social development of our people. We also embrace the just cause of Puerto Rican independence and support the return of the Malvinas Islands to their rightful owner  the Argentine people. In the same manner  we endorse the struggles of the Saharan and Cypriot peoples.   We also call on Israel to withdraw from the occupied Syrian  Lebanese and Palestinian territories. We stand unconditionally with the Palestinian people in their daily fight for their own sovereign State. That is why we advocate a peaceful  just and lasting solution that guarantees peace in that region. One year after gaining their independence  we congratulate the peoples of Abkhazia and South Ossetia  and affirm that we have already established diplomatic relations with Abkhazia.  We support the new and positive focus that Taiwan has adopted in its relations with the People’s Republic of China  as well as its participation in United Nations specialized bodies and agencies.  We condemn the coup d’état in Honduras and hereby proclaim our definitive decision not to recognize the results of any electoral farce in that country. By means of the coup  its perpetrators have sought to kill the democratic hopes and initiatives of the Honduran people  just as they sought to thwart the fraternal process of Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas (ALBA). Nonetheless  a change in Honduras that supersedes a formal and hypocritical democracy is inevitable.  From this rostrum  we denounce the massacre of the Honduran people and point in no uncertain terms to the assassination plot against President Zalaya. We must heed this now  because later it will be said that he committed suicide. From this very moment  we unconditionally support and endorse the proposal made last night in this same forum by the Foreign Minister of Honduras  Patricia Rodas  to the Secretary-General and the General Assembly.  The time has come to make the General Assembly a forum in which substantive  irreversible decisions are taken. We cannot continue to have a Security Council with an abusive veto privilege.  The time has also come for cooperation without humiliating preconditions  the construction of the most beautiful dream of Bolívar and Sandino  and the dawn of a realistic and coherent solidarity. I speak of the Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas  composed of the peoples of Antigua and Barbuda  Bolivia  Cuba  the Dominican Republic  Ecuador  Nicaragua  Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  Venezuela  and Honduras in its resistance. ALBA is the basis for cross-cutting and inclusive cooperation between our peoples. Its membership increases day by day.  I cannot fail to note with profound concern that we are meeting today under economic circumstances that are similar to or worse than those of a year ago  when the worst world economic depression of modern times arose to exacerbate the existing food  energy and environmental crises. Unfortunately  these world crises have met with a decrease in official development assistance  which remains conditional thanks to the international financial institutions  and with the reluctance of developed countries to replace the current model with one that is more just and respectful of Mother Nature.  The United Nations Conference on the World Financial and Economic Crisis and Its Impact on Development demonstrated that the Group of 192  as it has been called by my brother  Father Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann  has a voice in world economic matters. It is within the most representative institution that economic policies affecting millions should be decided  and not within exclusive groups  such as the Group of Eight or the Group of 20  defenders of the model of domination by the few over the majority. In that regard  we welcome establishment of the ad hoc open-ended working group that will follow up on the outcome of the Conference.  For some years now  climate change has become not a threat of the future  but rather a very present threat. We believe that the United Nations Climate Change Conference  to take place in December in Copenhagen  should be a debate not on the need to act  but rather on the need for the developed countries to fulfil their historic obligation under the Kyoto Protocol and to end their attempts to repudiate the principle of common but differentiated responsibility.  It is time for attitudes and actions to reflect a true commitment to counteracting the harmful effects of global warming. We firmly believe that it is the   09-53165 10  exclusive responsibility of the General Assembly — and in no case of the Security Council — to seek the consensus and commitments necessary for us to move forward in this struggle  which is a struggle for the survival of all humankind.  It is not possible to democratize selfishness  exclusion or the manipulation of truth. It is not possible to put a kind face on perversion or arrogance. That is the essence of the prevailing economic system — the exploitation of one human being by another  the subjugation of nations  and the hoarding of wealth by the few.  This is why we are in crisis; it is not because of a lack of resources  but because of the concentration of resources in the hands of a few  because of disregard for our environment  because of the rejection of moral values  because of human arrogance towards other species and  worst of all  because of disdain for human life itself.  We are optimistic. It is necessary to replace and find alternatives to the current socio-economic and political model  which has led to unjustified interventions such as those in Iraq and Afghanistan  and to that now being committed against our region with the establishment of military bases in Colombia under the pretext of fighting drug trafficking.  We cannot fail to be struck by the fact that  despite the $7 558 000 000 invested  the flow of drugs out of Colombia continues to grow. In 1999  at the beginning of Plan Colombia  the drug traffic to the United States and Europe was an annual 600 metric tons. Today  in 2009  that traffic has more than doubled to 1 450 metric tons. In other words  the strategy of militarizing Colombia has failed  absolute proof of which are the numbers I have cited. The true objective of installing these “seven daggers in the heart of America”  as they are called by Commander Fidel Castro  is to salvage the moribund economic and political system with which capitalism flaunts its power by controlling the hemisphere’s water  oil and biodiversity.  We believe in the strengthening of energetic and progressive positions in the defence of peace and respect for the sovereignty of the countries of our region. We are sure that it will ultimately serve to further advance the Latin American unity dreamt by Bolívar  Morazán  Martí and Sandino. Today  the solidarity practices of Fidel Castro and revolutionary Cuba have grown and spread like never before. The wide world of Latin America has ceased to be foreign  and as Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann said during his particularly outstanding presidency of the General Assembly  the current scenario is not a tragedy but a crisis. Crisis purifies. The pain we now feel is not the death rattle of a dying man but the pain of a new birth.   Finally  I wish to inform the General Assembly that Nicaragua  respectful of international law  has abided by the ruling of the International Court of Justice in its decision of 13 July 2009  and has issued a presidential decree to regulate navigation in the San Juan River  over which Nicaragua has full  absolute and unquestionable sovereignty  as was recognized by the ruling.  I send greetings to all on behalf of our President  Daniel Ortega Saavedra  and of all Nicaraguans who sing in praise of Darío and who proudly carry on Sandino’s legacy in order to defend ourselves today with peace and dignity. Nicaragua is proud of its devotion to peace  honour  solidarity and the relentless struggle against injustice."
"129",5210,"NLD",64,2009,"A few weeks ago  the Empire State Building was lit up in orange  the national colour of the Netherlands. The reason was that  precisely 400 years ago  the Dutch East India Company commissioned Henry Hudson to find a shorter sea route to Asia via the north. After a brutal voyage filled with hardships  Hudson decided to change course. He never found his shortcut to Asia  but he did become the first person to map the area around the river that would one day bear his name  including the place where we are gathered today. Ever since then  the origin of the great city of New York has been closely linked with the courage and resolve of Henry Hudson. Today more than ever before  we must make those qualities our own.   In the past year  we have faced the harsh reality of a financial and economic system on the brink. The crisis has been so severe and so rapid that courage and resolve are now required of us all — the courage to place shared values and interests above narrow self-interest  the resolve to adapt existing global governance structures to a new reality and the courage to make decisive choices that take account of all interests  especially those of the world’s weakest and poorest people. That is my clear message to the General Assembly.  The Dutch Government has no doubt that a strong  decisive and efficient United Nations will be vital to that process. Only an integrated global approach will deliver the stability  solidarity and sustainability that the world needs so badly. The last few days in New York and Pittsburgh have shown that there is a clear realization that the world has changed and that we must work together more closely than ever before. Our interdependency gives us a shared responsibility. We can see now that the problems we face are too big for any single nation.   There is therefore strong will to address the underlying causes of the economic crisis  to work on systemic imbalances and to once again make finance a tool for growth. The agreement we reached in Pittsburgh on a framework for strong  sustainable and balanced growth is a big step forward. It shows that there is a widely shared conviction that we have much to gain from stability  solidarity and sustainability  both as individual countries and collectively. I would like to say a few words about each of those core concepts.   9 09-52586   The current crisis offers clear proof that in a globalized world instability anywhere is a threat to stability everywhere. The international policy response has shown that that is widely understood in the financial and economic context. That is a positive sign  even if there is still a long way to go. The Pittsburgh agreement on compensation systems should end a bonus culture that has grown out of control. We cannot allow the greed of a few to endanger the jobs of many. We must therefore prevent that kind of crisis from ever happening again.  Mr. Valero Briceño (Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela)  Vice-President  took the Chair.  Institutional reform should not stop with the financial and economic sector. There is a clear need for new arrangements that will allow us to manage a range of global governance issues at the same time. In the long term  the greatest threat to a stable world order is to allow the crisis to push the world’s other great problems into the background: climate change  for example  the energy and food crisis or the pressing issues of peace and security  poverty and human rights. We cannot let that happen. In some cases  we simply have to honour commitments that we have already made  such as the Millennium Development Goals. In others  we need the courage to see beyond this crisis to the world of tomorrow  as we must show at the climate summit to be held in Copenhagen.   In any event  the current situation demands that we place our common global values and interests above our acute domestic problems  however serious they may be. Therefore  now more than ever  we need a strong  decisive and efficient United Nations. We need it here in New York  but we especially need it on the ground. In that context  I would highlight the vital importance of the One United Nations Initiative  which needs follow-up  and soon.  Stability cannot be achieved without respect for human rights. As friends of the Iranian people  we are concerned about the worsening human rights situation and the violent crackdown on popular protests. The Iranian nuclear issue represents a major challenge to international peace and security  to regional stability and to the non-proliferation regime. The recent revelation of a nuclear facility that was long kept secret is additional reason for great concern. It calls for a strong reaction by the international community and for total transparency by Iran. Iran must regain the trust of the international community  comply with relevant Security Council resolutions and contribute to peace and stability in the Middle East.  In June of this year  the United Nations showed leadership by holding a major conference here in New York on the effects of the crisis for developing countries. The Netherlands fully supported that initiative  as there can be no stability without solidarity. After all  there is nothing more destabilizing than poverty  hunger and a future without hope. The economic crisis and rising food prices are threatening to sweep away a great deal of hard-won progress. In 2009 alone  the number of people forced to live on less than $1.25 a day will grow by at least 55 million.  There is a real danger that those who had no part in causing the crisis will be the people who suffer most deeply. In rich countries the crisis means the loss of jobs and assets. In developing countries it means rising child mortality and rising hunger. Therefore  in rich countries the crisis is serious; in poor countries it is a matter of life and death.  Let the donor countries honour an old promise and set aside at least 0.7 per cent of their national income every year for development aid; and let the current crisis also inspire recipient countries to use the funds as effectively as possible. Now more than ever  public support for development aid depends on transparency  good governance and an effective fight against corruption.   I would also add that international solidarity is not simply a question of development budgets. It also concerns the private sector. More and more businesses now recognize the importance of corporate social responsibility. I believe there is still a world to be won in that regard  not only for society but also for companies themselves. Corporate social responsibility makes good business sense.  My third subject  sustainability  is essentially about making choices and sacrifices  not for our own sake but for future generations. This session of the General Assembly is our last major stop on the road to Copenhagen. We should be aware that the progress we make there will affect the lives of our children  our children’s children and so on  down through the generations. That must be our main motive for seeking a radical change in the way we live.    09-52586 10   In Copenhagen we must reach an ambitious  fair and comprehensive agreement. We must be ambitious and set our sights high. Therefore  at Copenhagen the Netherlands will call for worldwide carbon dioxide emissions to be halved from 1990 levels by 2050. We should be fair to developing countries. Every country should contribute to the common goal according to its means. Every country will be expected to play its part. But those that need help in designing and implementing sound adaptation policies must receive it. That is why the Netherlands has set aside €500 million to promote the use of renewable energy in developing countries.  Comprehensive also means that we should not simply pave the road ahead with good intentions  but with concrete agreements — for example  agreements on developing the global carbon market  on sharing knowledge and on financial arrangements. We simply cannot fail at Copenhagen.   The world is much smaller than it was in the days of Henry Hudson  but it is far more complex as a result. Any solution to the issues I have raised today starts with recognizing our mutual dependence and responsibility. Within the concepts of stability  solidarity and sustainability we will find the shared values and interests that should guide us on the road ahead. It is a road that requires courage. But to echo the words I heard recently from the Italian Nobel Prize winner and senator for life Rita Levi-Montalcini  on her one-hundredth birthday  “Don’t fear difficult moments. The best comes from them.” Let us go forward in that spirit."
"130",5255,"NOR",64,2009,"In recent weeks  we have witnessed a resurrection of the authority of this Assembly and a new commitment to multilateral cooperation and a belief that it can and must be made to work. The new tone of voice we have heard from the United States here in New York is setting forceful persuasion above persuasive force and extending a hand to those who are willing to unclench a fist.   We must all seize this moment. Every country — including the smallest and weakest — can make a difference. Building bridges means that we must all reach out from where we stand today as we struggle together with the crises in finance  food  energy  climate and health. New efforts must be undertaken to break cycles of impasse  including moving decisively towards peace in the Middle East and a peace agreement that can deliver a Palestinian State living in peace side by side with Israel.    11 09-53165   Last month  the Secretary-General visited Norway’s Arctic to study the effects of global warming. As we approach the Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen  the pace of negotiations must accelerate. Economy-wide reduction targets must be set for all developed countries. Large and more advanced developing countries should commit themselves to measurable  reportable and verifiable actions. Cuts in emissions from rainforest preservation must be institutionalized — as stipulated under the United Nations Collaborative Programme on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries — funded and included in the new treaty.  Financing is key to success in Copenhagen. Our Norwegian contributions and proposals may generate substantial new and additional financing for measures in developing countries  based on public finance and dedicated income from the carbon market.  The financial crisis has pushed millions of people back into the trenches of poverty and made us stumble in our pursuit of the Millennium Development Goals. Loss of income is placing public policies at perilous risk  potentially undermining services on which the poorest and weakest depend the most  such as health and education services. Norway supports all the Millennium Development Goals. We will  for the second year in a row  surpass the 1-per cent mark in official development assistance (ODA). After the financial crisis hit us  we increased our ODA in absolute terms to show solidarity with those who are less fortunate than we are.  We focus our action on particular areas where Norway can make a difference. We will continue to take on a special obligation with regard to the health-related Millennium Development Goals. We have tripled our contributions to health care since the year 2000. Millions of lives have been saved through the efforts of a broad alliance of partners  private and public alike. We will continue to play a leading role until we have achieved those Millennium Development Goals.  The most disgraceful underachievement of the effort towards the Millennium Development Goals is the lack of progress to improve maternal health. While we can vaccinate children and give mothers a bed net under a tree at a particular time  what women need are round-the-clock services in clinics to ensure safe deliveries  as well as preparedness for transfer to a hospital in the event of complications. Strengthening health services is key to reducing maternal and child mortality and is also a vital element in guaranteeing the rights of women and children. New and dedicated efforts to combat maternal mortality will now be mobilized.  The appalling rise of rape and other forms of sexual violence reveals an ugly story of men around the world still regarding women and children as secondary citizens. We must never rest as long as women are denied the services and rights that we men take for granted. Nothing less than our claim to civilization is at stake.  Today  as we speak  the Security Council is debating the situation in Afghanistan after the elections  as well as the need for a new Afghan Government to connect more strongly with its people  fight corruption and narcotics  empower State institutions and protect human rights  and in particular women’s rights  so that the day may soon come when Afghans can take care of Afghanistan’s security and when Afghan men and women can run a democratic Afghanistan.  We must continue to support the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA)  which has a mandate to coordinate international assistance with the Afghan Government. UNAMA requires additional resources  as well as a strong commitment on the part of all United Nations Member States to the coordination of efforts under Afghan leadership.  We stand on the threshold of a new era of nuclear disarmament. The Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons next year must set a clear and specific agenda for the elimination of existing nuclear arsenals and for ensuring that nuclear technologies are only applied peacefully  to the benefit of mankind. Recent information casts new doubt about Iran’s nuclear ambitions. Iran itself has the opportunity and responsibility to remove this doubt  and it is imperative that it do so.  Furthermore  while nuclear weapons pose a threat of mass destruction  actual destruction of mass proportions is caused every day by small arms  cluster munitions and landmines. Motivated by the unacceptable harm that these weapons cause to civilians  Norway is committed to humanitarian   09-53165 12  disarmament. We urge all States to accede to the Convention on Cluster Munitions and to join intensifying efforts to control small arms and the arms trade.  Norway is honoured to have been elected a member of the Human Rights Council and will work with others to raise the credibility  effectiveness and visibility of that important body. Last week  Norway submitted to the Council its first report on the human rights situation in my country  taking a critical look at our own record and inviting constructive criticism. We encourage all States to submit to similar constructive criticism of their own records so that the review process becomes substantial and meaningful.  Here in New York  we welcome the decision to establish a new and enhanced gender entity and hope to see it operational as soon as possible. We will pursue the United Nations reform agenda and system-wide coherence  as well as the Delivering as One agenda. The United Nations should take pride in being subject to more public scrutiny; reform must be an ongoing effort. Only such an approach will allow us to keep lending the United Nations all the support this noble body deserves."
"131",5301,"NPL",64,2009,"I would like to begin by extending my warm congratulations to you  Sir  on your election to the presidency of the Assembly at its current session. As an incumbent Vice-President  I assure you of my delegation’s full cooperation in the discharge of your responsibilities. I also take this opportunity to place on record our appreciation for Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann  the outgoing President  for his exemplary leadership during the sixty-third session.   I thank the Secretary-General for his comprehensive report on the work of the Organization (A/64/1). We appreciate his efficient stewardship on various issues of critical global significance and on the reform of the United Nations. He also deserves our thanks for supporting the nationally driven peace process of Nepal.  I bring greetings and good wishes from the people and Government of Nepal  a country that expresses unswerving commitment to the ideals of the United Nations. We look to the Organization as a true advocate and upholder of the universal values of peace  justice  equality  freedom and human dignity. As was so aptly recognized in the Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2)  the United Nations is indeed the indispensable common house of the entire human family. A more efficient and stronger United Nations is obviously in the interest of us all.  Sovereign equality  territorial integrity  political independence  non-interference and the peaceful settlement of international disputes have become the bedrock of inter-State relations. These principles  enshrined in the United Nations Charter more than six decades ago  represent the highest ideals of contemporary international relations. They have stood the test of time and proved to be timeless and universal. They provide the basis for the smooth and harmonious conduct of international relations among States that are sovereign  independent and interconnected. As we march towards increasing interdependence through globalization  these well-established principles and norms of inter-State relations assume even greater relevance for us.  History stands testimony to the fact that human civilization has no linear progression. We live in changing times. Today  the nature  speed and scope of such changes are astounding. New opportunities and unforeseen challenges always await us along our way to peace  progress and prosperity. We often find ourselves at the crossroads of stability and peace  on the one hand  and conflict and domination  on the other. It is only with principled stands and determination that we have moved towards peace and development throughout history. Whenever we have digressed from these principles  perils and catastrophes have visited us. International solidarity and a true spirit of global partnership are therefore indispensable  and multilateralism offers the best means and opportunity to address the global problems of our times.  Nepal is currently in the midst of a great political transition. With the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Accord in November 2006  our decade-long armed conflict ended and a nationally driven peace process is now in progress. The Constituent Assembly  consisting of 601 members elected through a mixed-proportional system  has been writing a new  democratic and republican constitution. It is one of the most inclusive and representative elected bodies in the history of Nepal. Almost one third of the Constituent Assembly members are women  and a fair number represent the country’s various ethnic minorities. Thematic committees on various aspects of the new constitution have been preparing their respective reports following a process of broad consultations with the Nepali people. We are determined to take the peace process to a positive and meaningful conclusion  as envisaged in the Comprehensive Peace Accord  by building consensus among the political parties through dialogue and consultations.  We are a multi-ethnic  multilingual and multireligious country. As we have opted for a Federal Democratic Republic  we are now restructuring the State by organizing it into federal units  as desired by the people of Nepal. We believe democracy is more meaningful when it is closer to the people. We believe that reconfiguring the State into federal units is one such significant step towards deepening the roots of democracy in our country.  My Government has four major tasks at hand: taking the peace process to its positive and meaningful conclusion  writing a new democratic constitution through the Constituent Assembly within the stipulated time frame  speeding up the country’s economic development to lift it up from poverty  and meeting the   33 09-52586  rising expectations of our people in a new democratic environment. We have been doing our best to accomplish these tasks through dialogue  consultations and consensus among the country’s major political parties.  Looking at the overall progress we have made over the past three years  there is reason to be forward-looking and optimistic about Nepal’s peace process. We have come a long way in terms of our transition from the decade-long violent conflict. As in every post-conflict situation  there have been ups and downs along the way. Managing the legacy of the violent past with justice and reconciliation and mainstreaming all the forces involved into a democratic order are the major challenges before us.  We are for democratic order  peace and stability. There is no place either for extremism or for permanent instability in Nepal. The Government is doing its best to ensure moderation in order to institutionalize democratic rules and ideals and to leave conflict permanently behind. I am sure that there is a common understanding on this issue within the country and among our friends in the international community. The desire to avoid a relapse into conflict and to fulfil the hopes and aspirations of the people has constantly prodded us to move forward with dialogue  consensus and unity of purpose. We know that we still have far to go  and we are determined to reach our destination — a peaceful  prosperous and stable Nepal.  In achieving that  we know we must be alert to the desire of our people for both freedom and development. Freedom rings hollow when there is no development. Development loses its soul if it is not accompanied by freedom. These are our twin goals  and my Government is committed to pursuing them with clear vision and commitment.  I am confident that we will have the continuous support and cooperation of the international community in achieving these goals. Needless to say  any failure to address the rising expectations of our people and to provide peace dividends to those affected by the conflict at the grass-roots level  may have unintended consequences that challenge the peace and democratization processes in Nepal and elsewhere. Therefore  to promote the positive conclusion of the peace process and to institutionalize our hard-won democracy  the Nepali people deserve support for rehabilitation  compensation and reconstruction arising from the damage that occurred during the conflict. I request special support from development partners in addressing our post-conflict development challenges.  We are fully committed to the protection and promotion of human rights. Since the end of the decade-long armed conflict and the beginning of the peace process in 2006  the human rights situation in the country has improved significantly. The Government is determined to establish a truth and reconciliation commission and a disappearance commission as part of ensuring transitional justice and restoring social harmony and peace. We already have our National Human Rights Commission  which is a constitutional body with full autonomy in its area of work.  We appreciate the continued support of the United Nations to Nepal’s ongoing peace process through the United Nations Mission in Nepal. We are determined to bring the peace process to a positive and meaningful conclusion as early as possible. As we ourselves are now undergoing a post-conflict situation  we understand the importance of peacebuilding in post-conflict societies. Nepal is pleased to contribute to the work of the Peacebuilding Commission as a new member of its Organizational Committee starting this year. We understand that a review of the activities of the Commission is slated for 2010. That would provide an opportunity to assess its activities and also to explore ways to make peacebuilding a more effective and innovative mechanism.  Whether it concerns issues of peace  conflict  terrorism  climate change  the financial crisis  food security  development challenges or other vulnerabilities  we are so interconnected that no country can escape their impacts. The global village has become a palpable reality before us. Global problems thus require global solutions. In that context  I welcome the selection of the theme “Effective responses to global crises: strengthening multilateralism and dialogue among civilizations for international peace  security and development” for this year’s general debate.  The economic and financial crisis that swept the world within a relatively short span of time is the most recent reminder of the vulnerability inherent in the process of globalization and its global implications. If we look around  we will see that climate change is another issue staring at us. Regional conflicts are yet another global issue of concern to us all.    09-52586 34   The least developed countries (LDCs) and landlocked developing countries  among others  are the most vulnerable with regard to all those issues. Their special needs call for more specific and an enhanced level of international support in terms of their concerns and challenges. At the same time  the outcome document of the United Nations Conference on the World Financial and Economic Crisis and its Impact on Development (resolution 63/303  annex)  held here in New York in June this year  should be implemented in all earnestness. We also stress the early implementation of the outcome document of the International Conference on Financing for Development (resolution 63/239  annex)  held in Doha last year.  While the global financial and economic crisis wreaked havoc on the already fragile economic health of the least developed countries  that unanticipated shock has also brought into sharper relief the urgent need for an enhanced level of understanding  resources and a policy space for the developing countries to mitigate its impact and to avoid its recurrence.  The global crises have posed a serious challenge to the fight against poverty in the LDCs. The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) can still be achieved if all of us in the international community act together  and act urgently. The proposed review of progress in the implementation of the MDGs should provide us a renewed opportunity to reinvigorate our development agenda. We urge the developed countries not to let the economic and financial crisis become an excuse for curtailing their aid commitments with regard to the MDGs and other internationally agreed development agendas.  Indeed  as recognized at the Group of 20 Summit in London earlier this year and as so consistently emphasized by our Secretary-General  the people of developing countries  especially the LDCs  need their own international financial rescue package to ensure that we do not backtrack on programmes towards achievement of the MDGs.  Nepal is a country with young mountains and a fragile ecosystem. Global warming  one of the most ruthless signs of climate change  has led to unprecedented melting of the Himalayan snow. Nepal experienced an annual temperature increase of 0.06  Celsius degrees between 1977 and 2000. With that  the threat of glacial lake outbursts has increased. Flash floods have become more frequent and more destructive. Delayed and insufficient rainfall has affected crop production. The poorest of the poor farmers have suffered the worst from all those effects. Agriculture  health  livelihoods and infrastructure are all being affected by them.  Nepal recently hosted a high-level regional conference on climate change focusing on the Himalayan region in order to highlight the seriousness of the problem of global warming and its impacts on the Himalayan range. The unprecedented snow melt in the Himalayas could jeopardize the lives and livelihoods of over 700 million people downstream and in the coastal regions. The conference produced a 10-point understanding that emphasizes  among other factors  the need to put into practice the principles of common but differentiated responsibilities and the respective capabilities and historical responsibility of the developed countries  as envisaged in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  as well as a financing mechanism on adaptation and transfer of technologies to sufficiently meet the urgent and immediate financial needs of the region in a predictable  easy and direct manner.  Concrete actions that match the level of the threat are needed. The other day  we had a fruitful discussion at the Summit on Climate Change  convened by the Secretary-General. While I thank the Secretary-General for that important initiative  I urge all to continue that spirit of positive thinking and to work together to converge all our efforts to find a just and effective solution to the ever-increasing problem of climate change.  The Copenhagen Climate Change Conference should be able to seal the deal and work out a new global compact to address the problem of climate change beyond 2012 in keeping with the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities  with special consideration given to the characteristics  vulnerabilities and weaknesses of the least developed and other developing countries.  The LDCs have particular vulnerabilities associated with their structural constraints  systemic deficiencies and historical socio-economic factors. The bottom half billion people face the daunting task of improving their living standards despite persistent efforts and commitment. Their plight is further exacerbated by the global problems that affect them disproportionately because they do not have cushions   35 09-52586  or alternatives. Therefore  their plight deserves special consideration by the international community.  As we prepare for the fourth United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries  we need to seriously consider the implementation status of the Brussels Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the Decade 2001-2010  and endeavour to tackle all existing obstacles in our way through a committed and collaborative partnership. We would also emphasize the need for full implementation of the Almaty Programme of Action for landlocked developing countries.  Nuclear non-proliferation  nuclear disarmament and the proliferation of small arms are matters of global concern. We welcome Security Council resolution 1887 (2009)  adopted on 24 September 2009  which seeks to contain proliferation  ban nuclear tests and bring about further cuts in nuclear weapons.   Disarmament being a comprehensive issue  we are of the view that promoting regional discourse on disarmament would help build confidence and prepare the groundwork necessary for realizing our eventual goal of general and complete disarmament. In this context  we see an important role for the United Nations Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in Asia and the Pacific  which has been operating from Kathmandu since last year. We urge Member States to be generous in extending financial support to the Centre for conducting its programmes and activities.  In spite of sustained and concerted efforts on the part of the international community  terrorism continues to pose a serious threat to international peace and security. Nepal strongly condemns terrorism in all its forms and calls for early conclusion of a comprehensive convention against terrorism. We reiterate our commitment to combating international terrorism  including through the implementation of the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy (see resolution 60/288) adopted on 8 September 2006 and of various Security Council resolutions  such as resolutions 1373 (2001) and 1540 (2004).  After more than 60 years  there is no denying that the United Nations needs institutional reform and reinvigoration to maintain continued relevance and effectiveness. In this context  we hope that the intergovernmental negotiations started by the General Assembly can lead to significant reform of the United Nations system — including the Security Council  by adding new members in a fair and equitable manner in such a way as to reflect the current realities of the contemporary world.  In an increasingly globalized and interconnected world  the issue of migrant workers has become prominent. Remittances have become one of the major sources of earned foreign currency for almost all the least developed and other developing countries. We therefore urge the international community to adopt a comprehensive approach and policy towards migration  including regarding protection of the rights of migrant workers in the face of the current economic crisis.  We are concerned about the continued deadlock in the World Trade Organization’s Doha Development Agenda negotiations  as well as about the new waves of protectionism that are built into the inward-looking stimulus packages being adopted to deal with the global financial and economic crisis. Given the exceptional vulnerabilities of the least developed and landlocked developing countries  developed countries  in accordance with international compacts and commitments such as the 2002 Monterrey Consensus  should immediately make available to them duty-free entry for their exports  debt-relief packages and other capacity-building measures. Such resources are very important to the fight against poverty  hunger  illiteracy and disease in all the least developed countries  particularly those affected by conflict  which encounter huge development challenges in post-conflict recovery.  While peacekeeping remains one of the core activities of the United Nations  its multidimensional nature has posed new managerial and logistical challenges in recent years. Peacekeeping evolved out of necessity  and it has to be adapted to match the new and emerging challenges inherent in today’s increasingly complex peacekeeping missions. In this context  we appreciate the Secretariat’s “New Horizon” non-paper  aimed at engaging and ensuring broader support from Member States and troop-contributing countries. Let me recall here that Nepal has been one of the longest-standing continuing partners in United Nations peacekeeping missions. Today  we are the fifth largest troop-contributing country. Our commitment to international peace remains as strong as ever  and our support for the United Nations in its peacekeeping activities will continue unabated.  In conclusion  I would like to reiterate Nepal’s abiding faith in the principles and purposes of the    09-52586 36  United Nations Charter. We stress the need for introducing timely reforms in the United Nations and its operational mechanisms  in order to enhance the Organization’s role and relevance in the emerging new global order of the twenty-first century. Nepal is always willing to contribute in whatever ways it can to the attainment of the noble objectives of international peace  security  development and prosperity for all.  As a least developed country  engaged in a peace process and in rebuilding post-conflict  Nepal has many challenges to face. My Government is making every effort to meet these challenges and appreciates the support extended by the United Nations. At the same time  we would like the international community to be more generous in assisting us in our national endeavour to institutionalize peace and democracy  rebuild our infrastructure and enhance our economic growth."
"132",5318,"NRU",64,2009,"I would like to offer my congratulations  Mr. President  on your assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. Allow me also to commend your predecessor  Father Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann  for his capable leadership during the sixty-third session. I assure you  Sir  of my delegation’s full support and cooperation as you lead the work of this important session.  The new millennium has been no stranger to crisis. We have seen how ideological extremism can foment turmoil and civil unrest in ways that do not respect international borders. We have also learned that financial instability can quickly propagate through global markets and cause chaos in the real economy. And we have been repeatedly reminded that we disrespect the natural environment at our peril.  The global challenges that we face today may sometimes shock us  but they should not surprise us. Most stem from problems that have been allowed to fester and grow for many years  if not decades. All are inextricably linked to the choices made by the international community regarding international commerce and development. The challenges of the new millennium are global in nature and therefore require a global response. Now  more than ever  we must revitalize our multilateral systems of governance in order to make them more responsive and more representative. Large countries tend to dominate international forums and drown out the rest of us.   In the case of climate change and small island States  I mean that quite literally. We must consider the impacts of our activities and institutions on the most vulnerable  so that large and small countries alike can enjoy the stability and security necessary for sustainable economic development. In this new millennium  even the mighty have been humbled. So what does that mean for a small island nation like Nauru? When giants stumble  it is usually the smallest that suffer the most serious injuries.  The international community must begin this process of renewal by reaffirming its commitment to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  an initiative meant to alleviate the burdens of extreme poverty  hunger  illiteracy  inequality and disease. After early success in the 1990s  progress towards the MDGs has slowed throughout the world.   In the Pacific  where nearly 40 per cent of the population lives on less than a dollar a day  it has been no different. The reasons are not hard to identify. The Asian financial crisis was devastating for the economies in our region. The recent spike in food and energy prices has strained our limited financial resources. Now the global economic downturn threatens to depress our economies even further.  Additionally  the Pacific confronts a unique set of challenges in reaching our MDGs. Our remoteness makes it difficult to access world markets and greatly increases the cost of doing business. Our small size deprives us of the advantage of economies of scale  and our vulnerability to climate change places our hard-won economic and social progress in jeopardy. Perhaps the most vivid example of our situation is the price of a bag of rice. For most countries  the food crisis has eased as commodity prices have fallen but  in Nauru  the price of a bag of rice has increased by 80 per cent over the past year  hovering now above $60. The rest of the world pays less than $25.  The time has come for the international community to deliver on its promises and to dedicate 0.7 per cent of gross national income to helping developing countries meet their development goals. Past recessions have led to a steep drop in levels of official development assistance. There will be no hope of reaching our MDGs if that happens again.  It is vitally important for United Nations agencies to strengthen their engagement in the Pacific region. For the past four years  Nauru has called upon the United Nations to establish a presence on the ground by opening an office in our country. It is my fervent hope that the next time that I address this body I can announce that that commitment of the United Nations has been fulfilled.  The absence of the United Nations in the Pacific is reflected by the paucity of statistics collected in the region. Accurate indicators are necessary for tracking economic and social progress. It is critical for United Nations agencies and other international institutions to work more closely with our national Governments and with regional organizations so that accurate data is available for planning and policymaking.  The temptation to add layer upon layer of new programmes must be avoided. We must not forget the commitments made under the Mauritius Strategy for the Further Implementation of the Programme of   5 09-52463  Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States  the Monterrey Consensus  the Paris Declaration and other international agreements. Too often  the United Nations and other development partners succeed in delivering many new reports  but fail to deliver tangible results. Action plans are no substitute for action. We must dispense with the excuse that helping poor countries develop is something that we cannot afford. That is simply not true. Quite the opposite: in a globalized world  leaving large portions of the world to languish in poverty is what we cannot afford.  The international community must also reform the world financial system so that all developing countries share equitably in global economic prosperity. The current economic crisis has revealed deep flaws in our international financial system. The overriding goals of those reforms should be to facilitate growth in developing nations and to increase their resilience to abrupt economic fluctuations and the fickle flow of capital.  While Nauru does not have a mature financial sector  shocks to the international system can be devastating to our local economy and dry up vital development assistance. To be effective  development assistance needs to be reliable. That is not possible without a stable and transparent financial system.  Lastly  the international community must next take swift steps to mitigate climate change  starting with a bold agreement in Copenhagen. Climate change presents the greatest threat for my country and many other small island developing States. Scientists warn that  within our children’s lifetime  sea levels may rise by a metre or more. That would wipe out low-lying coastal areas  and many Pacific islands would be a distant memory.  However  we do not need to wait for that catastrophic scenario to see the impacts of climate change. We live with them every day. Flooding and inundation are already eroding our shores and contaminating our water supply. Higher water temperatures and ocean acidification are damaging the marine ecosystems that we depend on for food and our economic livelihood. We pray that malaria does not find its way to our doorstep.  I applaud the commitment of the Secretary-General to addressing that issue and his efforts to build consensus among world leaders this week at the high-level Summit on Climate Change. From Asia to Africa and the Arctic  he has visited affected regions to observe the effects of climate change first hand  but not the Pacific  one of the most vulnerable regions in the world.   When the Secretary-General glances out the window of his aircraft while travelling between Asia and the Americas  I would ask that he remember that  in the vast expanse of water below  there is a whole region of people living on small islands who are already grappling with the consequences of climate change. I encourage that his next trip be to the nations of the Pacific before they disappear.  The science tells us that we must reduce the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere to 350 parts per million or less in order to avoid the most dire climate change scenarios. However  most developed countries have proposed emissions targets that would result in concentrations far higher.  That is not acceptable policy when human lives are at stake. If a doctor prescribes medicine to treat a serious illness  do we only give the patient half of what is needed? If an engineer says eight columns are necessary to support a building  would any responsible person recommend that we use only four? Then why are the most vulnerable countries asked to accept proposals that would surely lead to our extinction? That is not good enough when the lives of real people from real places are being threatened.  Developed countries must also provide the financial  technical and human resources necessary for us to address a problem that was not of our own making. Nauru joins the Alliance of Small Island States in calling for developed countries to provide the equivalent of 1 per cent of their gross domestic product for urgent adaptation and mitigation efforts in developing countries. That must be in addition to their current commitments for development assistance.  Climate change calls for the widest possible cooperation from every member of the international community. Taiwan  as one of the world’s 20 largest economies  can contribute in many ways and should be invited to play a larger role in the United Nations system  particularly in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change process. Taiwan has much to offer to vulnerable countries  especially in adaptation measures  technology transfer and financing.    09-52463 6   Climate change is an imminent threat to international security. It is therefore vital that the Security Council be seized of the issue and closely monitor new developments. Special attention must be paid to the most vulnerable countries  including the small island developing States and least developed countries  and also to vulnerable groups within countries  including women and children  indigenous people and the poor.  The challenges of the new millennium can be overcome only through multilateral cooperation and a revitalized United Nations system. It is necessary for the Security Council to be more representative in both the permanent and non-permanent categories to reflect current geopolitical realities  which is why Japan  India  Germany and Brazil should be made permanent members. I also call upon the General Assembly  as the world’s most representative governance body  to accept Taiwan’s meaningful participation in its specialized agencies and other world forums.  We have seen the power of multilateral cooperation around the world and close to home. My country was at the brink of economic collapse at the beginning of this decade. In cooperation with Pacific Islands Forum member Governments  my country outlined a number of key governance and development priorities in the Pacific Regional Assistance for Nauru (PRAN) programme. It included a re-evaluation of fiscal policies and objectives  review of our Constitution  and reforms for our education and health sectors. I am proud that in just four years we have reached the goals laid out in PRAN  so much so that at the fortieth Pacific Islands Forum Leaders’ Meeting  held in Cairns  Australia just last month  leaders agreed that Nauru had emerged from the crisis phase and was on the path to sustainable economic recovery and development  and that PRAN was no longer required.  PRAN was an excellent example of how country-focused development aid can quickly lift a nation out of crisis and back onto the path towards sustainable development. PRAN was successful because it identified concrete objectives and was backed by sufficient funds. Future programmes in the region should likewise bring tangible benefits and be free from political influence.  Here I must acknowledge and express Nauru’s deepest appreciation to Australia  New Zealand  Taiwan  Japan and Forum island countries  our own regional organizations and others for their unwavering funding and other forms of support to PRAN. The people of Nauru will always remember their generosity during our time of need.  We are also grateful to the United Nations Democracy Fund. With its assistance  Nauru recently adopted a number of important constitutional amendments that will enhance good governance and bring increased stability and responsiveness to my Government.  One of the founding fathers of the United Nations once said  “The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little”. President Roosevelt passed away before the inaugural session of the General Assembly  but those of us here today have the responsibility to see that his spirit lives on.  The United Nations system of multilateral governance was born out of a time of great crisis and it ushered in over half a century of peace and prosperity. However  the benefits were not shared equally  and two thirds of humanity was largely left behind. The time has come to take up the project begun 64 years ago so that future prosperity can be shared by all  including the smallest and most vulnerable. The United Nations continues to be our best hope for creating a fairer and more just world.  God bless the Republic of Nauru  and God bless the United Nations."
"133",5365,"NZL",64,2009,"To the powers  to the voices  to the four winds: I greet you all. I have addressed the Assembly in Te Reo Maori  the indigenous language of New Zealand  and I bring warm Pacific greetings from all New Zealanders.  I am deeply honoured to lead New Zealand’s delegation to the General Assembly for the first time. Like every New Zealand Prime Minister since 1945  I stand here today to reaffirm my country’s commitment to the United Nations and the United Nations Charter.  The founding Members of the United Nations gathered in San Francisco in 1945 to create this Organization out of the ashes of the most destructive war and the most debilitating depression in modern history. They believed in the larger freedom of a world where collective action might avert common crises. They believed in the rule of law  by which all States would be held to a universal standard  and in a world where all peoples  faiths and cultures could flourish. They believed in a future in which every human being would be free from want and free from fear. And they wanted an international Organization and architecture that could deliver those benefits.   New Zealand was active among those founding Members in San Francisco. And  as a small  independent and diverse country in the Pacific  New Zealand still has a stake in the United Nations — this great meeting place for all States.  I have benefited personally from efforts to secure those ideals. My family fled persecution in Europe  and I was privileged to grow up in a new world where a child of immigrants is now accorded the extraordinary privilege of leading his country and addressing this Assembly on its behalf.  We meet at a time of many challenges. With 130 heads of State and Government assembled here this week  the present session of the General Assembly represents our greatest opportunity since the 2005 World Summit to reaffirm our collective resolve. New Zealand embraces that opportunity. Today  I will focus on some of the most pressing issues demanding collective responses from us.  The crisis in the global economy continues. We must remain resolute in our efforts to stabilize the global economy in order to permit a return to sustainable growth. New Zealand welcomes the actions of the Group of 20 (G-20) over the past year. But  in commending those efforts  we call on the G-20 to heed   31 09-52470  the voices of the world’s small economies and to ensure that they are also heard in global decision-making.  Free and fair trade will be the principal engine for driving developing countries out of poverty and bringing greater prosperity to all. An essential component in our response to the global economic crisis must therefore be a balanced and ambitious conclusion to the Doha Round of world trade talks. A genuinely global agreement that reduces tariffs  eliminates export subsidies  reduces domestic subsidies and increases market access will see benefits flow to all States. At a time when all countries are suffering from the brunt of the current economic crisis  further delay is inexcusable.  As one of the world’s first truly open economies  New Zealand has an unwavering commitment to trade liberalization and to the pursuit of bilateral  regional and global free trade agreements. We support the call of the Secretary-General for the immediate suspension of price controls and other agricultural trade restrictions  in order to reduce soaring food prices and help millions cope with the highest food prices in 30 years.  Therefore  I call on all those States and groupings that have broken their undertakings and reintroduced protectionist measures to reconsider. Those actions are as harmful as they are unacceptable. Agriculture  which is so important for developing countries in particular  is one of the sectors most affected.  The escalation of poverty is a result of the economic crisis. New Zealand is  naturally  proud of the efforts of the United Nations Development Programme to strengthen its focus as the largest United Nations development agency on poverty and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.   For its part  New Zealand pledges to continue to increase its official development assistance  with a clear focus on the Pacific Islands region. Aid effectiveness is just as important as the quantum of aid. That is why  last month  we committed to the Cairns Compact  which will strengthen development coordination in the Pacific islands.  The major focus of the General Assembly this year must be on the challenge of climate change. Climate change demands innovation and a global response. The world cannot afford to contemplate failure at Copenhagen. Political leadership is needed  and it is on display.   At the Summit on climate change this week  the leaders of the world’s three biggest economies showed their determination both to make Copenhagen a success and to take action themselves. All countries must take action that reflects our individual circumstances  responsibilities and capabilities.  For our part  New Zealand is committed to securing a durable and meaningful agreement on climate change — an agreement that is both environmentally effective and economically efficient. I have set a target for New Zealand of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 10 to 20 per cent below 1990 levels by 2020  if there is a comprehensive global agreement. That amounts to a per capita drop of 35 to 42 per cent since 1990.  New Zealand is acutely conscious that most of our greenhouse gas emissions come from livestock methane emissions  which so far no technology can reduce. At the same time we are proud of our role as a food producer to the world and the contribution we can make to assuring food security for the world’s people.  Our challenge is to find a way to balance growth in agricultural production with the need to reduce emissions and reach climate change targets.   That is not just a challenge for New Zealand  but one for the world. Agricultural emissions make up 14 per cent of all emissions worldwide. As demand for food rises  so will those emissions. Yet so far the only known way to achieve emission reductions from agriculture is through reductions in output  which is not an acceptable response — not for New Zealand  and not for a growing world that seeks freedom from hunger.  A better response to this challenge must be found. In my view  the response must draw on the power and possibility of science. Just as New Zealand is proud of its agricultural producers  so are we proud of our role in agricultural research. This research has resulted in scientific and technological advances that have improved production and fed virtually millions of people.  But advancing research in the area of emission reduction requires a commitment so broad that it is beyond the capacity of any one individual country.    09-52470 32  That is a challenge that requires collective action  and it is collective action that I call for today.  New Zealand has developed a proposal for a global alliance on the reduction of agricultural emissions. This alliance would undertake international research and investment into new technologies and practices to help reduce agriculture-related emissions and would seek to achieve greater coordination of existing efforts.  Through a global alliance we can find solutions faster  make better use of the money that is being spent around the world and encourage all countries and companies to do more. We have been delighted with the interest that our proposal has received so far  and we will continue working with others to explore the concept. Today  my call to other agricultural producers of the world is to rise to this challenge and join New Zealand in this research effort.   I now want to address some of the security crises that we confront. Yesterday I had the honour to observe the high-level Security Council meeting on disarmament and non-proliferation. As a country with a proud record of promoting nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation  I was heartened by the expressions of support for a world free of nuclear weapons. We must all take full advantage of this historic moment to advance the nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation agenda. We owe it to our generation and to those who follow us to move our vision for a world free from nuclear weapons forward. As a proudly nuclear-free nation and a country that has been at the forefront of that debate since the 1970s  New Zealand stands ready to play its part.   We are optimistic about the prospects for progress. Last week  New Zealand presided over the General Conference of the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna  Austria. Preventing the spread of nuclear weapons through the implementation of safeguards under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty is a fundamental pillar of the Agency’s work. Next year sees the quinquennial review conference of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.  New Zealand will actively work with our New Agenda Coalition partners for a meaningful outcome at that conference to bring us closer to a truly secure world.   We will also continue to address the humanitarian harm caused by conventional weapons. We will work for a robust  action-oriented outcome later this year at the second review conference of the Ottawa Convention on Landmines.  Looking back  I am proud of the role that New Zealand was able to play in the negotiation of the Convention on Cluster Munitions. The Government attaches priority to passing legislation to enable us to ratify this very significant treaty. New Zealand also continues to play its part in maintaining and promoting international peace and security.  Peacekeeping remains one of this Organization’s most essential tasks and most solemn responsibilities to its Members. While United Nations peacekeeping has been significantly strengthened since the testing it underwent in the 1990s  the demands now being placed on it are severe.  I want to express my profound gratitude to those civilians and military personnel who place their lives at risk to support peace and live up to the ideals of the Charter of the United Nations. Ensuring that United Nations peacekeeping is as effective and responsive as possible must therefore remain one of the Organization’s most urgent priorities.  The United Nations provides the legal mandate — and often the operational effectiveness — for our joint efforts to achieve and maintain peace and security. New Zealand is firmly committed to supporting United Nations peacekeeping — both its own operations and others that it has mandated  such as those in which we are involved in Afghanistan  the Solomon Islands and Timor-Leste.  All too often  however  the United Nations has found itself unable to respond to emerging crises. New Zealand therefore strongly supports the concept of responsibility to protect. I am pleased at the solid foundation that the General Assembly’s recent debate on that responsibility has laid for its implementation.  New Zealand also strongly supports the International Criminal Court (ICC). It is a fundamental tenet of our domestic legal systems that wrongdoers must be brought to justice. The ICC is the mechanism for applying that same principle to persons accused of the most serious international crimes.  New Zealand takes very seriously its responsibilities for creating and maintaining peace and   33 09-52470  security in its region and in the world. I am therefore pleased to confirm New Zealand’s candidature for the United Nations Security Council for 2015-2016 in the elections to be held in 2014. In advancing its candidature  New Zealand does so as a State committed to upholding the international rule of law and to providing a strong and principled Pacific voice on behalf of small States like ourselves with an interest in a fairer and more secure world.  We all have a stake in a world where peace and the rule of law prevail  where all States are secure and can prosper and where all people are guaranteed the human rights and fundamental freedoms promised them in the Charter.   But we also know that solutions to the problems we collectively face do not lie with inspirational goals and promises that can be — and far too often are — quickly and quietly forgotten and ignored. Hard  pragmatic decisions must be made. Enforceable solutions must be implemented.  We know that effective  collective action is in every country’s long-term  national interest. That is what New Zealand believed in 1945  and I recommit now to taking action to live up to the ideals of the United Nations Charter  here  in this great Hall  this evening."
"134",5409,"OMN",64,2009,"Allow me at the outset  Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki  to congratulate you and your fraternal country  the Great Socialist People’s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya  on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. We are confident that your experience and knowledge of the role and influence of the United Nations in international relations will play a great part in the success of the work of this session. I also take this opportunity to express our thanks to your predecessor  His Excellency Father Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann of friendly Nicaragua  for his excellent efforts in guiding the work of the previous session. I wish also to express our appreciation to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his tireless efforts to enhance the effectiveness of the Organization’s machinery. We wish him every success.  There is no doubt that the United Nations has achieved much during its more than 60 years of joint international action. Its achievements have made a positive contribution to the maintenance of international peace and security. The Organization has provided technical assistance to developing countries in their socio-economic development projects  and has helped to reach consensus on many political issues and conflicts  contributing to the development of international peacekeeping mechanisms.  And yet the Palestinian issue remains unresolved despite all the efforts of Arab countries and the international community. We believe that the Arab Peace Initiative and international peace efforts are the most appropriate way to settle the Arab-Israeli conflict on the basis of an end to occupation  the return of Arab lands occupied since 1967  the establishment of an independent Palestinian State on the West Bank and Gaza Strip with East Jerusalem as its capital and the removal of all the illegal and illegitimate Israeli settlements. This would indeed help to achieve peaceful coexistence and positive cooperation between Arab States and Israel  and would contribute greatly to opening new horizons of cooperation  progress and development in the region and the world at large. Peace based on those principles would be one of the most important achievements of the people of the region and would pave the way towards ending regional crises and eradicating the root causes of terrorism.  We thus call on Israel to seize the historic Initiative and join the efforts to establish a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East  one that would bring security and peaceful coexistence to all the States and peoples of the region. Squandering this historic opportunity would constitute a grave loss for the Israeli people  and we would all regret it.  We welcome the recent positive developments in Iraq. We hope that such developments will continue in order to achieve security and stability in that country  contribute to the success of the comprehensive national reconciliation efforts and help establish positive  cooperative relations with neighbouring countries  allowing Iraq to resume its distinct positive role in the region at all levels.  We look forward to positive results from the Darfur peace talks  to be held in Doha  Qatar  between the Sudanese Government and the Darfur opposition. We hope that the parties concerned can build a framework for a political agreement that would help realize security  stability and development in Darfur. We also welcome the policies of Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed  President of the Transitional Federal Government of brotherly Somalia  and his efforts to achieve peace in his country. We urge all of our brethren and all factions in Somalia to renounce violence and embrace dialogue. We support international efforts to combat piracy and armed robbery against commercial ships off the coast of the Horn of Africa.   37 09-52598   We welcome the continued cooperation between the friendly Islamic Republic of Iran  the international community and the International Atomic Energy Agency. In this respect  we see some positive signs that could lead to a sound diplomatic solution.  There is no doubt that the efforts exerted by the rich industrialized nations to restore stability and balance to the international capital markets have begun to bear fruit. This could lead to the recovery of the world economy. We believe more international effort is needed to reach consensus in the Doha Round of trade negotiations  taking into account the interests of all States  including the developing countries. In light of the serious shortages of food  water and medicine from which many countries are suffering  we urge the rich industrialized countries to increase investment in agriculture research  food security and the supply of water and medicine  for these have a direct impact on humankind.   It is also our hope that the Climate Change Conference to be held in Copenhagen at the end of the year will adopt a long-term plan to protect the environment and reduce harmful carbon dioxide emissions.  In conclusion  I would like to express our deep thanks and gratitude to the President of the General Assembly for his efforts in leading the work of this session. We urge all Member States to take the necessary practical measures to help us reach consensus on all the issues on our agenda. "
"135",5456,"PAK",64,2009,"I am honoured to return to this chamber of hope  peace and cooperation. I wish to convey the warm greetings of the people of Pakistan. We are delighted to see you  Mr. President  presiding over the General Assembly. The high ideals of the United Nations have inspired our vision of a global society that is based on peace and justice  freedom and human rights  equality and equal opportunity  freedom from want and hunger  tolerance and harmony — a global society that believes in the sovereign equality of nations large and small  and that promotes truth and reconciliation.  On behalf of the people of Pakistan  I assure you  Mr. President  of our cooperation in fashioning a safer and better world in which all children — yours and mine — shall live in peace and harmony. This is a world in which we shall all depend on one another. It demands a return to the path of the United Nations. It calls for reforming the United Nations on the principles of equality and consensus building.  In Pakistan  the will of the people has prevailed. Our people have witnessed a profound democratic transformation. We have entered a new era of democracy  the rule of law and human rights. Democracy in Pakistan is of great importance not only to our country  but also to our region and the world. Pakistan has struggled hard for democracy. My late wife  Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto  led the fight for democracy and laid down her life for it. Following in the footsteps of her great father  Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto  she made the ultimate sacrifice so that our nation might live in democracy. We are now following in her footsteps. I  my party  my people and Pakistan’s democracy are grateful to the international community and to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for constituting an international commission of investigation into her assassination. We are confident that the commission will bring out all the dimensions of her life  work and tragic assassination.  The world supports our struggle for democracy  and we are grateful for that support. Democracy in Pakistan is beginning to achieve successes in the fight against militancy. The real challenge now is to make democracy sustainable  and indeed irreversible. This requires that democracy should be able to deliver. It should meet the aspirations of our people to progress and prosperity. It must give our people peace and stability.  Unfortunately  our neighbourhood has witnessed decades of conflict. Pakistan has suffered greatly from   29 09-52463  terrorism and religious extremism. Terrorism and extremism were not previously known to our society and culture. Religious extremism entered our society and the region when we all in the free world decided to confront a rival ideology. The policy was based on the exploitation of religion to motivate Muslims around the world to wage jihad. It was a policy whereby jihadi leaders were referred to as the moral equivalents of George Washington. It was a policy that allowed warlords and criminals to destroy civilizations to come. The virus multiplied and has affected the world.   To eliminate militancy we must strike at its roots. Surgery alone will not be enough. We need to address the causes of deprivation  poverty and illiteracy. We need to adopt dialogue  development and a wise use of force as our strategy.  Pakistan has firmly responded to the challenges of extremism and militancy. Democracy has given our people ownership of the fight against terrorism. Today  our nation stands fully united in this struggle. Our law enforcement agencies have  within a short span of time  cleared a large area in Malakand of militants. Of the more than 2.5 million civilians who were forced to leave their homes  about 2 million were hosted by their relatives and friends. I salute the host families. Democracy and political ownership of the war have proved to be the chief weapons in the fight against militancy. In the short span of 10 weeks  most of the internally dislocated have returned to their homes. We are now engaged in rebuilding their lives.   Pakistan appreciates the international community’s support and understanding of our efforts. We urge the international community to further reinforce this support. We are determined to eliminate terrorism and extremism from our territory. To that end  the early return of peace and stability in Afghanistan is critical. The flow of weapons across the region must stop. The funding and support to militants by drug barons and other elements must stop.   We also believe that regional cooperation against terrorism and extremism holds great promise. We emphasize regional efforts for peace and stability. Pakistan will continue to work with Afghanistan and the international community for the early restoration of peace and stability in that country. Pakistan has hosted almost 3 million Afghan refugees for the past three decades. We have been providing for them on our own. We call upon the world to help in the safe return of the refugees to their homes.   Pakistan’s democracy has begun to deliver. We are doing more in self-interest. We urge the world’s democracies to do more for the peace and development of the people affected by militancy and terror. We need to create economic opportunities for our people. We urge our friends and partners to help Pakistan by providing market access for the economic revival and well-being of their own people.   Pakistan desires friendly relations with India. We believe that dialogue is the only way forward. The absence of dialogue leads to tensions that must be avoided. We look forward to the resumption of the composite dialogue process. We seek a peaceful resolution of all outstanding issues with India. Meaningful progress towards a resolution of the Kashmir dispute is necessary for durable peace and stability in South Asia.  Pakistan also supports the rights of the Palestinian people as guaranteed in several United Nations resolutions. Durable peace in the Middle East requires that the issue of Palestine be addressed meaningfully.   We also call for the immediate release of Aung San Suu Kyi.  All nations seek security. Peace and security are closely linked. Equal security for all is important. We support all efforts for arms control  disarmament and non-proliferation. The principle of equal security is of fundamental importance for achieving those objectives. Imbalances in security  especially at the regional level  need to be redressed. Pakistan will continue to play a constructive role in promoting conflict resolution and restraint in South Asia and in promoting initiatives on nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation on the basis of non-discrimination.  Pakistan’s priority is economic development. We wish to build on our internal strengths. In this effort we seek partnerships. We seek to develop a win-win situation. We are engaged in economic revival by developing our agriculture  building mega-hydro projects  initiating water conservation projects  undertaking infrastructure projects  promoting regional trade and cooperation and encouraging  beyond Government  the corporate sector in development. We    09-52463 30  need to develop a framework for cooperation that will deliver quickly.  In overcoming the challenges faced by the world  the United Nations has a central role to play. Guided by its principles and the high ideals in its Charter  the United Nations is destined to succeed. A democratic Pakistan will continue to uphold the ideals and values of the United Nations. Together we shall succeed. In the words of my leader and martyred wife Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto  “time  justice and the forces of history are on our side”. "
"136",5499,"PAN",64,2009,"The people of Panama welcome the very sound decision to elect Mr. Ali Treki to serve as President of the General Assembly at its current session. We are sure that he possesses the vision and the leadership to guide the nations represented here today.  I should also like to thank the Secretary-General for his tireless pursuit of dialogue in the interests of peace  security and the peaceful coexistence of peoples and brothers.  Yesterday saw the conclusion of the Summit on Climate Change. I congratulate all nations for their collaborative efforts in confronting the global-warming crisis. The beauty  resources and biodiversity of our shared heritage are in peril.  Global warming is the most serious symptom of a crisis caused by the excessive exploitation of resources. We must apply new formulas  change our behaviour and learn to value our relationship with nature. Our options are clear: we can talk or we can act. If we do not act with global responsibility  the consequences will be irreversible.   Three million years ago  the Isthmus of Panama emerged from the sea. We are one of the youngest countries on Earth. As a result of our birth  a land bridge was formed between North and South America and constituted the narrowest stretch of land between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Panama parted the seas to unite continents  and generated a new global network of ocean currents that transformed the climate of the entire planet. The whole world changed when Panama came into being.  Today  all forms of life upon this planet are the result of an evolutionary process that adapted to our birth. The great African savannahs and deserts came forth from these changes  and modern man evolved from those new savannahs.  Panamanians have always played an important role for our neighbours and for the world at large. In the next five years  it is our duty to demonstrate how our economic and governmental model can serve as an example for all who aspire to prosperity and progress.  I am an entrepreneur  not a politician. I went into politics to change how things are done. I am a simple and direct man. I believe that time is very short and very valuable. I will expand upon my experiences in the private sector and put them to work in the public sector.  I was elected to the presidency with an unprecedented mandate. Panamanians gave me a clear mandate to deliver change to our country and build a better Panama for all. We are placing the interests of the people first and foremost  above personal or partisan interests  because a country is more important than a political party.   I have selected the best people to work in our Government without regard to their political affiliations. I have plans for the nation. We want capitalism which is based on opportunities and rewards responsible entrepreneurs who show solidarity  but   21 09-52320  capitalism which also strongly demands responsibility and solidarity from any old-fashioned entrepreneurs who do not satisfy those two criteria.   We formed this Government during a crisis. Less than a year ago  we saw the collapse of the international financial framework. The global economic model was forever changed. Our guiding light is the improvement of our peoples’ quality of life. That is why  during the first 100 days  we increased the salaries of all public officials and distributed $100 per month to senior citizens over the age of 70 who do not have a pension and require economic aid.   We will be building a modern new metro in Panama  and it will be the largest employment programme in the history of the country after the expansion of the canal currently under way.  We have launched a construction project for low-cost housing which will not only provide a safe roof over the heads of thousands of Panamanians  but will generate jobs at difficult times during a crisis.   The promises we have made meet the demands of our people. But beyond that  they are part of the plan we need to boost our economy.   America is a recently populated continent  and Panama was the bridge across which the first native Americans crossed to South America. They built great cultures and civilizations such as those of the Incas and the Chibchas. When the Spanish arrived  they made our country into the commercial hub of their colonies. When Panama separated from Spain  the first railroad in the world between the Atlantic and the Pacific was built  and that in turn led to the construction of our canal. Today  Panama is the gatekeeper of the global economy.  We are a small country  with less than 3.5 million inhabitants  and services represent more than 75 per cent of our gross national product. The United States dollar is our currency. We have a solid banking and financial centre which is very conservative and strictly regulated. The Colón Free Zone is the largest in the hemisphere  thanks to the most important commercial maritime route in the world  and this makes us the most efficient logistical hub in the Americas.   We shall soon begin the construction of a third set of locks to expand the capacity of the Panama Canal  thereby opening an important gateway for international trade.   Panama is an ideal place to invest  to establish enterprises and also to live. We will be transforming Panama into the Hong Kong or the Dubai of the Americas. Within the new Panama-Pacific Special Economic Area  labour and immigration laws are welcoming and flexible. Throughout our national territory  there are fantastic incentives for investors. Our spirit of service and open door policy make Panama an enjoyable  exciting place of true opportunities.   And despite the crisis Panama is growing. Talent and creativity  social assistance  infrastructure and investment in human capital will allow us to weather the storm.   Panama was born to serve the world. Everyone is more than welcome in Panama. We are open for business.  We believe in free trade as a tool to improve people’s lives. We want to do business with all nations and have signed free trade agreements with our strategic partners. We have already signed one with the United States. To be ratified  it just needs one small “push”  and I believe that President Obama will deliver that push very shortly.  In Panama  we are proud of our history and our heritage  our freedom of expression and thought  our freedom to determine our country’s direction  and our tradition of peace.   Peace is the best sentiment that any country or  indeed  the whole planet can have. Peace brings with it tranquillity  stability and growth. There is absolutely no reason why neighbouring peoples should offend one another  because no one wins and we all lose. The children of Bolívar share the same history and the same challenges. We have the same blood in our veins. We are a single nation. Here  anyone who attacks  attacks only himself. Anyone who retaliates  retaliates against himself. Anyone who bears arms does so against himself. Because here we are all siblings.  Weapons of war bring poverty. They steal the bread from our mouths and the future from our children. These weapons are not necessary  and at the end of the day they solve nothing. Let us sit down together  for there is nothing that we cannot solve together. There is nothing like peace. And peace is   09-52320 22  what all countries of the world should be pursuing until it is achieved.  I would like to talk here about our sister country of Honduras  and the need for it to return to the rule of law  which is necessary for its well-being and that of Central America. That is why we are closely following the reconciliation in Honduras.   The San José accord constitutes the best method for formulating a consensus Government that can oversee new elections and guarantee a peaceful return to democracy. Let us allow the Honduran people to solve their destiny and future with one another. We Panamanians have the utmost trust in the Honduran society’s capacity for reconciliation.  Nothing is stronger than words  either spoken or written  and through dialogue we understand one another  to paraphrase the poet. Communication is the best conduit for cultures  education  ethnicities  history  religions and politics. In Panama  we are a melting pot of races  nationalities and ideologies that  through communication and mutual respect  has created a diverse society with common interests. That is part of our idiosyncrasy and is what makes us who we are.   Tolerance is the secret to the coexistence of peoples. Nuclear tests make us all nervous  and living in a state of alert only serves to increase tensions between nations whose relations are already less than stable. That is why we live in constant fear and mistrust  which has a significant impact on dialogue between us.  In Panama  we respect the use of science as a tool for human development  but we reject its use as a front to conceal nuclear proliferation and the production of weapons of mass destruction.   A challenge to global peace and security lies in the war on drug trafficking  money-laundering and arms trafficking. Because it is a crossroads  Panama is used by organized crime for drugs and arms trafficking. But we are declaring our own war. We have become an active partner with Mexico and Colombia in the battle against narco-terrorists. Alongside President Uribe and President Calderón  we are committed to strengthening the ties of cooperation  so that Panama can be an active source of intelligence.   The many efforts and improvements that Panama has achieved in this field have been recognized in reports by the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering and the International Monetary Fund. Panama has information exchange agreements with 39 countries to combat money-laundering and the financing of illicit activities.  Drugs are not good business. Those who dedicate themselves to them are destined to jail or the cemetery. They have no future.  Mr. Nasheed (Maldives)  Vice-President  took the  Chair.  Everyone knows Panama as a banking centre  as a place to do business  and because of our canal. But in fact  we are nature’s best-kept secret in the world. Tourism is our new passion. Panama City has the highest concentration of migratory birds on the planet. We are the hub for America’s flying species. The Gulf of Chiriquí has the greatest biodiversity of any spot in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean. Forty percent of our national territory is protected. This includes over 1.5 million hectares of uninterrupted forests between Chagres and Darién.  Our national parks have been declared biosphere reserves and world heritage sites  as has the island of Coiba  a natural jewel where they are still discovering new species and where whales from the Arctic and Antarctic meet to give birth to their calves.  Over 1 000 islands and coral reefs beautify our seas  and we are framed by over 2 500 kilometres of coastline  many of them as pristine and untouched as when Christopher Columbus first arrived in the Americas.  But the very best resource we have is our people. We are a multiethnic and friendly people. Our indigenous peoples of the comarcas are an example of resistance to mistreatment at the hands of nature and cultural assimilation.   All the countries represented in this Hall have their own wonders that the entire world admires. We must unite to protect and conserve our beauty  resources  biodiversity  world heritage and  first and foremost  our peoples.  I am an eternal optimist. I see my country  Panama  providing more jobs for its men and women. I see a middle class that keeps growing and earning more. I see new technologies spawning unprecedented economic growth. I see the first country in the world with free internet access for all its citizens.   23 09-52320   I see Panama with better health care  better education  better transportation  and with families that are happier and more unified. We Panamanians can do anything we dream of. And if each and every one of us achieves our dreams  we will have a better world.  In the five years ahead of us  we are going to dream big. Our best days are yet to come.  If I had to describe Panama in just a few words  I would say we are a country and a people full of surprises. Panama will amaze you  and Panama will amaze the world."
"137",5546,"PER",64,2009,"I wish first of all to congratulate Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. Knowing his broad experience in the United Nations and his dedication to dialogue and consensus  I assure him that Peru will constructively support his initiatives.  The global outlook is extremely complex and full of great contradictions. We face the deepest economic and financial international crisis that our generation has experienced and which once again proves that the borders in a global world are purely cartographic and that the symbol of our times remains interdependency. The economic and financial crisis has stymied world    09-52598 6  growth and  above all  exposed the weaknesses that caused the market to malfunction. As rarely in recent history  the international community has mobilized huge resources and political capital to avoid unprecedented economic collapse. A significant share of those resources must support the developing countries  which certainly did not cause the crisis but are the most affected by it.  It is regrettable that the convergence of wills and interests with regard to the crisis is  in turn  not apparent with equal resolve in the endeavour to achieve the Millennium Development Goals by 2015 and to firmly address the threats that endanger freedom  democracy and  ultimately  regional and global stability.  In that context  allow me to point out that one crucial problem we face is the huge sums spent on arms acquisitions. How can we explain to our peoples that  in the midst of one of the worst global economic recessions and with more than 1 billion people living in extreme poverty throughout the world  countries can commit over $1 464 billion to military expenditure in 2008  and that  while economies contract  arms purchases grow in real terms every year?  Recently  the President of Peru  Mr. Alan García  in a communication to South America’s ministers for foreign affairs and of defence that is being circulated as a document of this General Assembly (A/64/367)  seriously questioned that state of affairs in the region and asked why  in the five years since the establishment of the Union of South American Nations  our countries have allocated for military spending a total of $156 billion  but in addition have acquired approximately $23 billion more in new weapons  cannons  aircraft and ships. That figure could reach $38 billion this year. The President appealed for that absurdity to stop if conditions are created for a strengthening of security and confidence in the region.  To that end  on this occasion I affirm Peru’s proposal that a friendship and non-aggression pact be concluded to guarantee the commitments to strengthening a zone of peace in South America  and to achieve the gradual reduction of arms purchases and the future establishment of a peace and interposition force to avert any conflict in the region. The final objective would be to create a regional collective security system that complements and is upheld by the Charter of the United Nations  enabling all our countries to end the arms race in which South America  a region that is otherwise demonstrating great maturity and respect for international law in the handling of its disputes  seems to be engaged for no discernible reason. Our proposal will certainly require greater study and consideration in the light of experiences in other parts of the world.  A second transnational threat that is not receiving due attention is drug trafficking and its dangerous link to terrorism and violence in general  the consequences of which affect not only the security and rights of millions of people  but also the environment. We are paying an enormous price through our inaction concerning a problem that causes millions of deaths a year and tremendous material losses.  At the global level  the traffic in drugs brings in around $500 billion a year  equivalent to 8 per cent of global trade  while  according to data of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime  their use affects over 200 million people  in particular young people  throughout the world.  According to the 2008 report of the International Narcotics Control Board  it is clear that South America’s narcotics trafficking networks collaborate with one another in their illicit activities  especially money-laundering  and recruit specialists at the highest technical level. It is therefore a matter of urgency that combating narcotics trafficking once more be given top priority on the world agenda and in cooperation between developed countries  pursuant to the principle of shared responsibility.  We must respond jointly to halt the advance of narcotics trafficking and related criminal activities  such as trafficking in arms or people  the destruction of nature  corruption and terrorism. Legislation concerning illicit crops and their interdiction and eradication should be complemented by prevention and rehabilitation programmes aimed at comprehensive  alternative and sustainable development. To that end  the concerted efforts of all international actors are essential under the principles of cooperation and  above all  shared responsibility.  In Peru  drug traffickers are working with the remnants of terrorist groups. This situation exponentially increases the level of violence among both criminal groups  and if we do not solve the problem now  we may find ourselves in a situation of unprecedented consequences in the future. Illicit coca   7 09-52598  production is a process of utmost destructiveness to the environment. Three hectares of forest have to be destroyed to obtain one hectare of coca. This is causing irreparable damage in the Peruvian Amazon forest; the logging and burning of trees to clear land for illegal crops erodes the soil and has resulted in the deforestation of 2.5 million hectares of Amazon forest  a leading contribution to global warming.  For all these reasons  the Government of Peru has devoted special attention to the problem in terms of financial and human resources. But the results have often left us feeling that this is a solitary struggle with a problem for which the international community  and especially the countries that consume the bulk of narcotic drugs  do not have adequate or rapid solutions. Peru  which dedicates more than $600 million a year to fighting an illicit industry with a turnover of $22 billion  cannot fight the illicit production of drugs alone or hope for any long-term success without the firm  supportive cooperation of the international community and  particularly  of the consuming countries  based on the established principle of shared responsibility.  Real cooperation has diminished alarmingly since 2002. The largest contributor to Peru reduced its contribution from $140 million to $128 million in 2003 and to $116 million in 2004. This year  the total will be $70 million and next year  $57 million. Peru therefore considers it essential for the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime to draft a report providing updated figures for the global resources that the international community allocates to combating the illegal narcotics trade  the donor sources and specific ongoing projects  as well as identifying key programmes to improve cooperation with the countries most affected by illegal drug production. Such precise  reliable and internationally comparable information would dispel many myths concerning the efforts and joint action that we should undertake without delay  and would be a practical starting point from which to better coordinate the efforts of contributing States  international organizations and financial institutions with those States most affected by illegal narcotics production and trafficking  in order to strengthen them in this fight. We hope that this task can be accomplished without delay  since  I repeat  international action in this area must not be postponed.  Another sensitive issue that has been the subject of special debate is that of climate change and the preservation of the environment in general. Peru is suffering dramatically from the effects of global warming  seen in the accelerated retreat of its tropical glaciers and its ensuing difficulties in adequately meeting the water needs of its population. Peru considers it essential to establish concrete goals for technological cooperation and transfer  as well as the creation of financial assistance funds for projects aimed at directly combating the effects of climate change in the countries most affected by it. Faced with the urgent need to confront the adverse effects of climate change  Peru supports the ongoing establishment of binding international commitments by the countries that created this problem  and hopes that at the fifteenth International Conference on Climate Change  to be held in Copenhagen in December  all States will be willing to adopt them.  In this regard  Peru reiterates its proposal that a financial mechanism be established towards the creation of a global fund to support measures aimed at mitigating and adapting to the effects of climate change in developing countries. This would involve a duty of $0.50 on every barrel of oil  inasmuch as the fuel bears a responsibility at every stage in its chain of production  from extraction through refining to its uses  direct and indirect. Peru also proposes that comprehensive programmes of adaptation to climate change be established. Such programmes  which could be financed by the Global Environment Facility or the World Bank  would identify a comprehensive approach to sectoral adaptation and emphasize strategies to reduce the occurrence of disasters and to protect the health and food security of affected populations  economic infrastructure and biodiversity.  Finally  we wish to raise an issue of particular interest to Peru and developing countries in general — the situation of migrants. Peru is an active promoter of the defence of the human rights of migrants and their families  and of the sharing of responsibility for addressing this phenomenon by their countries of origin and host countries. We endorse the principle that migration is a factor for development and has undeniably been so throughout human history. It has enriched the culture and social life of nations  and allowed us to come into contact with the contributions  discoveries and developments that have gradually shaped our modern society.   It is therefore essential that we be aware that what migrants contribute to their host countries today     09-52598 8  and what they can contribute in the future  will be in large measure the backbone of those societies. That is why xenophobic and discriminatory pressures must be avoided  since they do nothing but delay the inevitable integration of the world and the human race.  In Latin America  we are living through a crucial time in the consolidation of democracy and the promotion of the social and political rights of our peoples. Peru therefore expresses its deep concern over the recent events in the sister country of Honduras  where the democratic system has been abruptly interrupted. The actions taken against Brazil’s embassy in Honduras should be repudiated and should cease immediately  pursuant to Honduras’s legal traditions as a country that respects its international obligations  particularly the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.  We call for a dialogue aimed at re-establishing democracy in Honduras. All Honduran political groups should take advantage of the return of President Manuel Zelaya to Tegucigalpa to establish a Government of unity and national reconciliation as outlined in the San José agreement  which  through entirely peaceful means  will allow the country to move forward with free  democratic and transparent elections that will guarantee the election of a Government that respects its Constitution and promotes national integration and solidarity for each and every Honduran citizen.  At a time when communications and technology bring us closer together than ever before  we must also understand that our problems and responsibilities should also bring us closer together and that challenges to one State are challenges to all. This Assembly therefore remains the most appropriate forum in which to discuss global and local challenges  which are now identical and of concern to us all  and should also — why not? — inspire us all with hope.  "
"138",5593,"PHL",64,2009,"Allow me to warmly congratulate Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki on his well-deserved election to preside over the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. I assure him of the full cooperation of the Philippines as he discharges the duties of his high office.  We are gathered here today  in this parliament of nations  to find meaningful solutions to the conflicts and crises facing our world today. Although there are signs of global recovery  now is neither the time for complacency nor for a return to business as usual. Our drive to enhance global development has clearly slowed  while the challenges to peace remain starkly before us.  Through globalization  we have witnessed unprecedented material progress and record poverty alleviation. Yet the poorest 40 per cent of the world’s population still live on less than $2 per day. Nor have we resolved the climate change and food crises that oppress hundreds of millions of human beings.  A large part of global development has been the result of labour  including that of migrant workers. However  despite their contributions to the global economy  many migrants remain exposed to exploitation and abuse. Moreover  the peace dividend expected from the end of the cold war never    09-52470 58  materialized  while we continue to confront nuclear proliferation and violent conflict. The shortage of aid resources and instability in trade and investment are generating a global development emergency. Many nations will not attain the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Development gains are being tragically lost.  Our march of progress must not stall — not on our watch and not while we have the will  the vision and the means to build a better world inspired by a shared commitment to justice  fairness  non-discrimination  progress and peace. We should do so by focusing on the five great challenges of our time.   The first challenge pertains to promoting nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. The second involves managing the global crisis to encourage equitable recovery  fairer globalization and faster poverty alleviation. The third entails protecting and promoting the rights of migrants  who continue to contribute to global development and the well-being of our societies. The fourth has to do with the taking of urgent measures to effectively address the adverse effects of climate change without further delay. And the fifth has to do with reducing the number of conflicts and expanding mutual understanding and respect through greater interfaith and inter-civilizational dialogue. (spoke in English)  Nuclear weapons and their technology are a threat to international peace and security  and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) is our central mechanism to contain  and eventually eliminate  that threat. The May 2010 NPT Review Conference  over which the Philippines will preside  will be the next opportunity for all of us to act on that matter in a concerted manner. We can be encouraged by certain recent developments on that front.   A constructive atmosphere prevailed during the meetings of the Preparatory Committee for the Review Conference. President Obama has announced that he will lead the United States to ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT)  which is another key pillar of the global disarmament and NPT system. In addition  the United States and Russia are making headway  under the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty  to reduce their deployed nuclear warheads and delivery systems beyond the Treaty’s upcoming expiry in December. In addition  the South-East Asia Nuclear-Weapon-Free-Zone and other regional nuclear-weapon- free zones are continuing to reinforce the NPT system. Those positive developments inspire the Philippines in steering the Review Conference to conduct negotiations and consultations in an open and transparent manner. In that spirit  we reiterate our call for the few remaining countries that have not yet done so to accede both to the CTBT and the NPT  in order to give greater hope for lasting peace and security for our world.  The global financial and economic crisis is placing intolerable strain on the poorest of the poor and undermining years of efforts to attain internationally agreed development goals  including the MDGs  and to combat ill-health and hunger. The crisis has been accompanied by increases in unemployment  with concomitant declining incomes and demand. The International Labour Organization estimates that unemployment could rise by 50 million by the end of 2009  thereby bringing the global unemployment rate to more than 7 per cent.  The Philippines and many other nations are implementing stimulus packages  accelerated employment-generation programmes and enhanced social safety nets. In the Philippines we have strengthened our banking sector and fiscal position through tough reforms that have blunted the full force of the global crisis. The Philippines is one of the few economies that continues to have positive growth in its gross domestic product. However  we cannot ignore the impact of the global crisis elsewhere in our interdependent world. The Philippines therefore joins other nations in the General Assembly in calling for a united effort in the United Nations to act for the common good of all our peoples.  The United Nations Conference on the World Financial and Economic Crisis and Its Impact on Development  which was held in this very Hall last June  presented Member States with lines of action that we must take now to stimulate the global economy  improve regulation and monitoring and reform processes and institutions to prevent any recurrence of the crisis.  We view the Global Jobs Pact put forward by the International Labour Organization  which was endorsed by the Economic and Social Council this past July  as another important step towards recovering from the crisis. We reiterate our call on all countries to resist   59 09-52470  protectionism in order to expand trade and investment flows. We also call on developed nations to maintain their commitments with regard to official development assistance. Furthermore  the voice of the developing world must now be fully heard in reforming international financial and development institutions so that we can forge a more equitable and stable global economic system to avoid future crises.  Global migrants are among the groups most adversely affected by the crisis. The international community therefore has a shared responsibility to ensure their protection  taking into full account the special vulnerabilities of the gender and family dimensions of the issue. The second Global Forum on Migration and Development  which the Philippines was privileged to chair in Manila  reinforced that important message by focusing on the human face of migration and on the human rights and empowerment of migrants. We urge all nations to accede to the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families  and to avoid unfair restrictions on  and unfair treatment of  migrants.  We must carry the momentum of the Summit on Climate Change  held here in New York  forward into the negotiations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change on the road to Copenhagen this December. The world expects nothing less from us. The Philippines therefore calls on the developed countries concerned to present their firm post-Kyoto greenhouse gas emission targets  taking into account the ideal levels suggested by the scientific community. They must also assist developing countries to mitigate and adapt to worsening climate change by fulfilling their Framework Convention obligations to provide technological and financial support. As a coordinator of the G-77 in the talks  the Philippines will continue to work with all parties to help to ensure a positive outcome in Copenhagen.  The Philippines is doing its part to advance that vital global agenda. We recently enacted a landmark law to promote the development and use of renewable energy resources  especially biofuels. Earlier this month  the Philippines also hosted the International Conference on Green Industry in Asia. The Manila Declaration on Green Industry in Asia and the Framework of Action adopted at the Conference promote the integration of sustainable development into industrial development processes for the transition to resource-efficient and low-carbon industries. We hope that elements of the Manila Declaration will provide input for Copenhagen as well.  The international community must also focus on the urgent need to reduce tension and conflict fuelled by perceived differences between religions  faiths and civilizations. If left unattended  such conflict can fester  causing greater tension and untold human suffering and violence  which extremists can exploit. The urgency of the matter has prompted the Philippines and many partner nations and organizations to promote greater interfaith dialogue  both within the United Nations system as well as at regional and national levels. By building bridges of understanding  that global advocacy enhances peace and development.  Every year  the Philippines has submitted to the United Nations a draft resolution calling for interreligious and intercultural dialogue  understanding and cooperation for peace. The General Assembly has always adopted it unanimously. Also at the United Nations  we initiated the holding of the Ministerial Meeting on Interfaith Dialogue and Cooperation for Peace  which includes countries from every region of the world. In 2006  we also launched the global Tripartite Forum on Interfaith Cooperation for Peace  which is headquartered in New York and made up of 54 Governments  15 United Nations agencies and 110 religious non-governmental organizations represented at the United Nations. To reinforce that effort  the Philippines will host the first special Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) ministerial meeting on interfaith dialogue and cooperation for peace and development in Manila this December. We are pleased to invite all United Nations Members and other interested nations to that important seminal meeting. (spoke in Spanish)  The spirit of multilateralism and prudent realism also requires that we support United Nations peacekeeping efforts. In crises and emergencies around the world  we must do more collectively to alleviate suffering and to help nations and communities to achieve self-sustaining peace. The Philippines will continue to be active in United Nations peacekeeping. Indeed  the Philippines has become one of the largest contributors of individual police officers to United Nations peacekeeping operations. More than 600 of our peacekeepers are serving with distinction around the world. Next month  we will send a battalion in support    09-52470 60  of the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force  in the Golan Heights.  We stand on the cusp of history. It is in our hands  here at the United Nations  to shape the changes and trends necessary to bequeath to succeeding generations a lasting legacy of a world of greater justice  compassion and well-being. The Philippines is deeply honoured to assist and cooperate with all nations in the task of building a future where peace and prosperity reign unceasingly for the benefit of all humankind."
"139",5612,"PLW",64,2009,"I am speaking for the first time as Head of State. However  in 1977 I appeared with my country’s delegation before the Trusteeship Council  seeking independence. In 1994  the trusteeship ended and we took our place as a Member of the United Nations. Our independence is testament to the success of the International Trusteeship System  for which we are grateful. The legacy of our experience is a Constitution that incorporates the rights and freedoms enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights: freedom  democracy  equal protection and the rule of law.  We thank the permanent members of the Security Council  which recognized our sovereignty: the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland  the French Republic  the Russian Federation  the People’s Republic of China and the United States of America. The United States was our Administering Authority  and we express our deep appreciation to it for becoming our close partner under the Compact of Free Association  a relationship we cherish and one that we hope will endure.  As a new and young Member  Palau has shouldered its responsibilities in the community of nations  including the deployment of peacekeepers to Darfur  Timor-Leste and the Solomon Islands. When signing international conventions and meeting our counter-terrorism obligations  as set forth by the Security Council  we remember and honour the legacy of the United Nations.  While our political progress has been satisfactory since independence  I must report to you that we are now confronted with several looming threats to our continued peaceful way of life  and indeed to our very existence. Climate change  environmental degradation and the world financial crisis are challenges that we will only be able to overcome if we work with the international community.  We associate ourselves with the statements of concern on climate change which we heard in this Hall earlier this week. We applaud the commitments made and note that we must use our best efforts to stop this slow-moving tsunami that threatens to engulf us. To this end  Palau and our neighbours in the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands have adopted a joint policy  known as Green Energy Micronesia (GEM) to move to renewable energy as a pillar of our collective energy security. Furthermore  Palau has signed the Statute of the International Renewable Energy Agency  and we look forward to the exciting work that will emanate from the United Arab Emirates. We are hopeful that the combined efforts of all our nations will lead to a fruitful outcome in Copenhagen.  We note in particular the statement of the new Prime Minister of Japan  Mr. Yukio Hatoyama. Japan’s vision and commitment to save our planet are inspiring. This is one of the many reasons we support a permanent seat for Japan on the Security Council.  We reiterate that climate change is indeed a cross-cutting issue and that all aspects of it  especially the security impact of climate change  need to be examined. This is why Palau and the Pacific Small Island Developing States initiated General Assembly resolution 63/281  on “Climate change and its possible security implications”. We look forward to meaningful action by the Security Council on that resolution.  Palauans have lived throughout history in symbiosis with the sea. Now  though  the sea  which has long been the source of our sustenance  is simultaneously rising in rage to destroy us and becoming barren. This fury was caused by abuses by humankind  and we therefore must take every necessary action to allow the oceans to heal themselves. In days gone by  the traditional chiefs of Palau would declare a bul — a moratorium to protect a resource that had become scarce. This traditional concept  now popularly known as conservation  shows the way for us to move forward. As Mahatma Gandhi said  “Earth provides enough to satisfy every man’s need  but not every man’s greed”.  This is why the world must declare a bul on destructive fishing practices like deep-sea bottom trawling  unsustainable harvesting of shark for their fins and overexploitation of tuna stocks. The odious fishing practice of bottom trawling  where a weighted net is dragged along the sea floor  crushing nearly everything in its path  is contributing to the rapid loss of a critical ecosystem  our coral reefs. We have outlawed deep-sea bottom trawling in Palau  but  no matter what we do in our own waters  there must be an international solution. For several years  we  along with our Pacific neighbours  have advocated a    09-52463 8  moratorium on this practice. The sustainable fisheries resolution adopted by the General Assembly in 2007 (resolution 62/177) urged nations and regional fishery management organizations to stop trawling in sensitive areas by 2009. We have waited for compliance  which has not come  and we now renew our call for a worldwide moratorium on this practice.  An equally destructive fishing practice is shark-finning. We have banned it in Palau and call upon the world to address this issue in order to save sharks from extinction. The physical strength and beauty of sharks are a natural barometer of the health of our oceans. Therefore  I declare today that Palau will become the world’s first national shark sanctuary  ending all commercial shark fishing in our waters and giving a sanctuary for sharks to live and reproduce unmolested in our 237 000 square miles of ocean. We call upon all nations to join us. The need to save sharks and our environment far outweighs the need to enjoy a bowl of shark’s fin soup.  It is anomalous that Palau is experiencing economic difficulty while it sits in the middle of the richest fishing grounds in the world  the Pacific Ocean. We can no longer stand by while foreign vessels illicitly come to our waters to take our greatest resource  our tuna stocks  without regard for their conservation and without regard for adequate compensation to the island States that own the fishing grounds and rely on this resource. Palau believes that the best model for a regional effort to conserve our tuna resources and maximize the benefits to us is the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). I will therefore work for the establishment of OTEC  the Organization of Tuna Exporting Countries  and I now call on our friends in OPEC to come forward and help us to understand and obtain fair value from our threatened resource and to make tuna fishing sustainable.  I come now to the economic crisis that my country is facing. As a developing nation  we are grateful for the grants provided by our allies and partners to advance our development. They have been helpful.  Mr. Martínez Bonilla (El Salvador) Vice-President  took the Chair.  But we must acknowledge that outright grants do not always create meaningful employment. Jobs created are illusory and temporary. In the absence of a strong local economy  our children  our most valuable resource  are leaving our shores for opportunities elsewhere. The continuing downward cycle created by their departure must be stopped  or else it will destroy the very fabric of our society. Our allies and partners can help us stop this cycle by promoting the development of private enterprise through investment in our country. We need capital and entrepreneurial expertise.  I implore our allies and partners to consider providing incentives to their nationals to encourage them to invest in our islands  to come to our islands and launch partnerships with our talented people to create a viable economy. Let us once and for all put aside the fiction that we need handouts. What we need are partners and investment to help advance our economy  put an end to the out-migration of our people and propel Palau towards economic self-sufficiency.  We note with satisfaction the decision by the People’s Republic of China to invite Taiwan to attend the World Health Assembly. The health and safety of the world’s peoples are at the heart of the ideals of the United Nations. In order to further promote those ideals  we recommend that Taiwan be invited to participate meaningfully in the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)  the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change coming up in Copenhagen and other international organizations and forums.  We have heard the voices of world leaders from countries small and large  powerful and vulnerable. We have heard the voice of science. Let us heed those voices  fulfil our obligations to our people  now and in the next generation  and work for a strong economy and a healthy planet."
"140",5653,"PNG",64,2009,"It is indeed my honour and privilege  Mr. President  to bring you  on behalf of the people and Government of Papua New Guinea  our warmest greetings and to pledge our support as you preside over the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. We thank your predecessor  His Excellency Father Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann  for his strong leadership during his tenure as President of the Assembly at its sixty-third session.  We would like to reiterate our support for the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  the United Nations agencies such as the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and UNICEF for their efforts to enhance the benevolent work they do for the world and Papua New Guinea.  When God distributed the peoples of the world everywhere  he wedged in Papua New Guinea  a small country of 6.5 million people  between the South Pacific and the South-East Asia. It has been a privilege that has allowed us to appreciate the peaceful and colourful people of the Pacific as well as the dynamic nations of South-East Asia. We may not be a large country or a country of economic or military power  but in our own way and from our own standpoint  we have a right to contribute to the world among other nations  to collectively approach issues and problems and to speak out whether in support or in disagreement.  Very recently  on 16 September  we celebrated the thirty-fourth anniversary of our independence. But an important achievement for us was the fact that by the grace of God  we have had an unbroken constitutional democracy for those 34 years. Our current Prime Minister  the Grand Chief Sir Michael Somare  has been in Parliament for 41 years. He is the founding Prime Minister and has been ousted only through a parliamentary constitutional vote and has returned three times as Prime Minister  the current term being his fourth. I am mentioning this because Papua New Guinea is contributing to democracy in the world. Through its democratic form of government  in a nation of over 800 languages and cultures  a people of diversity can find a way towards harmony and political acceptance of one another.  We are proud of that achievement  but we are also mindful of the many critical challenges that lie ahead   5 09-53165  of us as we develop and progress. Many are challenges that cannot be handled by one individual country — whether large or small — on its own. The United Nations must therefore continue to provide the global forum for all Member States  big and small  powerful and weak  to come together to address the many global issues and challenges we face collectively as a human family. And together we must confront  first  the continuing threats of climate change and global warming  the global food crisis now compounded by the global financial crisis  and the threats of diseases that know no borders  such as H1N1  HIV/AIDS  malaria  tuberculosis  cholera  et cetera. Secondly  we must achieve together the social agenda of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).  Papua New Guinea firmly believes that strengthening international peace and security is fundamental and is a prerequisite to achieving human development  progress and prosperity. My country denounces weapons of mass destruction and is fully committed to the principles of a world free from weapons of mass terror. That is attested to by the fact that we are a State party to the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty and also fully support the Treaty on the South-East Asia Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone.  We are now working earnestly towards early ratification of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. We also look forward to contributing constructively to United Nations peacekeeping operations. Papua New Guinea therefore welcomes positive initiatives of the new United States Government and other like-minded countries to enhance the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and encourage disarmament.  A continuing major concern of Papua New Guinea is the increase in global conflicts heightened by the illicit trade and use of small arms and light weapons  which continue to cause untold suffering to millions of people around the world. The people of Papua New Guinea are no exception. The global debate on small arms has focused on curbing their use. However  the supply side of weapons is never comprehensively discussed. We therefore support a proposed arms trade treaty  which is still in negotiations and which will deal with one of the key elements of the arms issue.  In Papua New Guinea we have seen the presence of small arms and light weapons threaten the stability of communities. My Government prioritized the need to comprehensively address this issue through commissioning the 2005 National Gun Summit Report  which will be implemented soon.  The various global crises of today have had a disproportionate negative impact on many developing countries. From falling commodity prices to increases in food and energy costs  the damages caused and the costs incurred to redress them have heavily impacted their development. The impact of the crisis has also reduced levels of official development assistance globally and resulted in big shortfalls in the national budgets of developing countries.   While we appreciate that many countries have had to assist their economies by massive injections of capital  we nevertheless support the strong call for reforms of the international financial architecture to include major developing countries like China and India. Such reforms would better reflect today’s global economic realities and provide effective management of the global process  which needs to be fair  equitable and transparent.  At the 2005 World Summit  leaders agreed to a set of broad reforms to the United Nations. Since then  the Human Rights Council and the Peacebuilding Commission have been established. Furthermore  the concept of the responsibility to protect has received broad support  with an inclusive process now under way to better elaborate it.  We support the continuing call for the reform of the Security Council in both the permanent and non-permanent membership categories. In this regard  we support the ongoing intergovernmental negotiations within the General Assembly  which have seen the emergence of strong agreement on certain issues.  We note that great strides are being made in reforming the global gender architecture. We applaud the strong but cautious consensus reached at the sixty-third session of the General Assembly to support the creation of an Under-Secretary-General post to assist in better management of the various United Nations entities dealing with the gender issues. We take note of and commend the work of former Prime Minister of New Zealand  Her Excellency Helen Clark  as the UNDP Administrator. We therefore strongly support the ongoing reform  as the gender issue in its entirety   09-53165 6  remains one of the key policy issues of my Government.  As a growing democracy in the Pacific  it is my Government’s desire to see our friends and neighbours in the Pacific and beyond enjoy freedom and prosperity. We reaffirm our continuing support for our Pacific neighbours in their development aspirations. We feel that on the issue of Fiji we need to continue dialogue and not to isolate them. We also support the main thrust of the Pacific Plan and encourage our Forum dialogue partners to assist with its ongoing implementation  as we believe it will catalyse the Pacific region’s development.  The social sector of many of our developing countries suffers greatly  and the United Nations has quite rightly set the Millennium Development Goals. They provide us with one of the greatest opportunities to leverage our development process. We commend and strongly support the Secretary-General for his proposal to convene a high-level session on the MDGs in September 2010.  Achieving the MDGs remains an integral development priority of our Government. We are working to achieve the Goals in close cooperation with all stakeholders  including civil society and international development partners such as the United Nations and its agencies  the Commonwealth  the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat and the South Pacific Community.   The MDGs have been incorporated into our Medium-Term Development Strategy  which focuses on 15 national targets and 67 indicators under the National Road Map. They are specifically designed for Papua New Guinea to reflect the nation’s stage of development. MDG 8 is ongoing through international cooperation with bilateral and multilateral development partners.  The Joint MDGs Project was launched in August 2008 and comprises the National MDGs Steering Committee  made up of representatives of the Government  the United Nations  academia and civil society. The Project is mandated to build national awareness and facilitate a strong data collection and analysis regime in the country. The Project also serves as a constituency for the Medium-Term Development Strategy and the MDGs.  The Government has localized the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness by reaffirming its principles in the Kavieng Declaration to foster collaborative commitments with our development partners in pursuing the achievement of the MDGs. Our long-term aim is to grow our economy to such a level as to allow us to exit from our dependency on aid. We want to be economically independent; we choose not to be aid-dependent forever. We want to give aid and not receive it. Our aim is also to assist others from the richness of God’s blessings on us.  The Government recognizes that greater and sustained commitment to implement policies at all levels is needed to achieve the MDGs. That commitment will also be supported by ongoing public sector reforms  especially in relation to delivery of basic services to our rural majority.   For the MDGs to be achieved  strong and viable partnerships must exist.   MDG 8 is critical to the achievement of the other seven Goals. However  all our partnerships must be underpinned by mutual respect between the partners and the Government. Some of our key partners include Australia  New Zealand  the European Union  Japan  China  the United States  Italy and Austria  along with many non-governmental organizations  such as the Clinton Foundation and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation  which continue to strongly contribute to Papua New Guinea’s development.  Climate change has emerged as one of the greatest crises now facing humanity. The consequences appear dire  and they are truly global. Such a global challenge can only be met by a concerted global response.  In Papua New Guinea today  we see evidence of climate change in the inundation of coastal areas  an increase in malaria due to warming in the highlands region of the country  and especially in the plight of the people of the Carteret Islands  where sea level has risen and some 1 200 people have had to be resettled.  We therefore strongly support the recent Alliance of Small Island States declaration on climate change. For many small island States to survive  we must strive to roll back atmospheric carbon concentrations to less than 350 parts per million and limit temperature rise to less than 1.5 degrees Celsius. Therefore  emissions of greenhouse gases must peak by 2015 and be followed   7 09-53165  by reductions of 45 per cent by 2020 and 90 per cent before 2050. Further  we will require healthy and expanded forest cover and widely available low carbon technologies  including carbon capture and storage.  In this context  the importance and urgency of extensive action on reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) can hardly be overstated  and many delegations have spoken on it. Deforestation continues at an alarming pace  with around 13 million hectares of the world’s forests being lost annually — an area the size of Denmark  Norway and Belgium combined.  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates that deforestation and degradation in developing countries may contribute to approximately 20 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions caused by humans  while also representing around 30 per cent of the total cost-effective mitigation potential in the period up to 2020. Any solution to the problem should thus attract 20 per cent of any financial or institutional response.  It is worth stressing that  without rapid and significant reductions in emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries  added to deep emissions reductions by rich countries  it may be impossible to avoid global warming levels that will prove catastrophic for many vulnerable nations. Without question  immediate action on REDD+ is a crucial part of the climate change solution. Under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  we will therefore require strong institutional frameworks for REDD+  including accommodating different national circumstances and providing for resource mobilization.  We also recognize the excellent work and analysis under way via the Informal Working Group on Interim Finance for REDD. This work estimates that  if a total of €15 to €25 billion were provided to catalyse early action from 2010 to 2015  then a 25 per cent reduction in annual global deforestation rates may be achieved by around 2015.  Deforestation and degradation in developing countries are the results of the stark economic need for local communities to survive that propels the destruction of forests. How do we keep the trees standing to sequester carbon?  There is hope. Significantly  early actions for REDD+ can be achieved at a reasonable cost  while protecting the livelihoods of indigenous peoples and local communities  protecting biodiversity  rainfall patterns and soil quality  and helping countries to adapt to climate change. To succeed  a REDD+ mechanism should accommodate countries at different levels of development through a phased approach. The agreement should be results-based and incentives-driven. To achieve that  it must include both a reliable framework for monitoring  reporting and verification  and encourage a predictable and sustainable system for financing.  We must succeed in Copenhagen. If we are to succeed  rich countries must come forward and take the lead. Without their collective leadership on emissions reductions  finance and technology  the Governments of developing countries will not be able to make a compelling case at home to get people to allow trees to be left standing. As a result  20 per cent of carbon emissions will continue to flow into the atmosphere. Therefore  let me be candid. Without a transformative grand financial bargain in Copenhagen that involves all nations  there could be no deal.  Let me conclude by repeating that the United Nations is the forum for agreeing on solutions for problems and challenges. In times of global crises such as climate change  financial meltdown and social sector vulnerabilities  there is also opportunity. Indeed  there is opportunity here  if we remember that MDG 8 allows us to leverage the greatest asset we have: strong partnerships between nations  both rich and poor.  More than ever before  we need the political will of the leading developed and developing countries  for the sake of the children of the world and for generations after them. I ask the General Assembly to please consider this and make a stroke for history."
"141",5699,"POL",64,2009,"Sixty-four years since the foundation of the United Nations we recall the self-evident fact that the United Nations was created to prevent atrocities such as those that occurred during the Second World War  from 1939 to 1945. It was called into being in order to avoid a repetition of the failure of the League of Nations  the first worldwide organization  which tried to carry out its duties between the two world wars.  The United Nations over 64 years has undergone various twists and turns. There have been better and worse years  years when here in this Hall there were clashes between the forces of two camps  the so-called socialist camp and the free world. There were times when here in this Hall scores of new countries of Africa  Oceania and Asia emerged. There was also the time  20 years ago  when  after the collapse of the Soviet Union  there appeared many other new countries  and when others such as mine  Poland  gained real  not only formal  independence.   At that time the whole world believed that we had found a way to solve all problems  especially economic problems  using market economy rules  which meant a free economy and free movement of capital in all areas. We have to state clearly that  as we have heard here many times  in recent years this faith has been   43 09-52228  undermined  and therefore I have to devote my address to the problem of the crisis to some extent.  This crisis is a new problem. Participating in a General Assembly session for the first time  I can state that all the earlier problems  such as conflicts  of which there are many  the more recent problem of climate change  and the problem of poverty  are not new. To them we should add the problem of health: AIDS  epidemics and so on.  However  the problem of the current crisis appeared in the last year. Before coming to it  I should like to refer to what the President of Ukraine said. There are many causes of conflict in the world  one being the violation of faith in territorial integrity. Because many new countries have emerged over the past dozens of years  it is clear that there will be differences of opinion over this or that territory. If force is used to resolve such differences  as it was last year against Georgia  this may give rise to fundamental problems. It could be the source of local wars  but it could also be the source of great conflicts  even conflicts on a world scale. On behalf of my country  I warn against this.  I return to the problem of the current crisis. I represent a country that continues to develop. We are the only country in the European Union that will this year record — albeit small — economic growth. This is due to some factors that are specific to my country  so I do not wish to dwell at length on the subject. However  it is clear that one reason for the crisis is that we place too much faith in markets and banking systems that become more and more complicated. Sooner or later that must lead to the outcomes that we all see.  What preventive measures can be taken? They are known  but it is difficult to implement them. I believe that the United Nations has a great opportunity here. It is not that there will be management of the global economy. Such attempts are doomed to failure and will lead to another crisis. But it is not true that we do not need new rules  new regulations  to deal with issues that have also been discussed today  including supervision and oversight over the banking sector. Perhaps that oversight should not be global in nature  but it must include countries where banks are under no control  because that is the source of an economic pathology  which often facilitates large-scale criminal activity  such as drug-trafficking.  Another problem that has been mentioned here is that of so-called tax havens. Mention can also be made of cheap flags of convenience for shipping. We understand that all those who use them do so to improve the situation in their countries; we realize that from the point of view of various countries  especially those that are not rich  there is a reason. I am not here to criticize them. But it is in our common interest to put an end to such practices. There is no other organization in the world that can do this but the United Nations  through the creation of international norms.  President Lula of Brazil spoke about certain very important problems  including those relating to financial agencies affiliated to the United Nations. In that regard  I refer to the problem of greater flexibility in programmes launched by the International Monetary Fund or the World Bank.  There is another issue: better use of certain organizations affiliated to the United Nations. Here I draw attention first to the International Labour Organization (ILO)  which has been in existence for 80 years. It embraces almost all countries of the world and has about 2 500 employees. Should it not to a greater extent be a place for the formulation of programmes providing an alternative to liberal development? It seems that a reformed ILO could successfully perform that function. It requires a common effort  but it is feasible.  I am not talking about additional funds and financial means. I am talking about formulating alternative programmes that take the interests of workers into account to a greater extent than so far  and also a balance between different social groups  not only in the rich countries  but also in the poorer countries.  Today’s address by the President of the United States pointed to the fact that a country that  whatever one thinks about it  is the most powerful in the world today  is now approaching the problems of the United Nations differently. This creates a certain possibility for the Organization  our Organization. This is an opportunity that can be taken if the United Nations peacekeeping operations become more effective. We should appreciate the operations that have been carried out so far  but we need certain organizational changes to make the activity more effective. What I am saying does not exclude the tasks taken up by  for instance     09-52228 44  NATO. But the United Nations should play the leading role.  There is also the problem of United Nations reform  especially reform of the Security Council. I do not wish to dwell on the subject now  but we are all aware that it is a very important issue  in that there is a basic difference between what was established 64 years ago and what we have now.   In the past the United Nations has placed a great deal of emphasis on climate change and climate issues. Much has been said about the subject  and I do not want to repeat it. However  I strongly emphasize that this is a very important issue  requiring great sensitivity. If richer countries want to become strongly involved in climate protection  they must realize that the weaker States should be assisted  because this very just cause cannot be dealt with in such a way as to make development easier for some and harder for others. We should always bear that in mind in thinking about the solidarity of all nations and about the objectives given to the United Nations 64 years ago.  Last  but not least  I turn to an issue that has not been discussed at great length  except in regard to piracy: international terrorism. Today it is an important problem. The situation in some countries  such as Afghanistan and Pakistan  is very significant proof of that. Terrorism has its sources  not all of which are related to external ideologies. There are also some objective premises  and we understand this. We also understand that the United Nations can play a greater role than it has played so far.  Poland is a member of NATO  and is very much involved in operations. But we understand that under international law the only 100 per cent legitimacy for such operations derives from the United Nations. This is very important now and also for the future  because we must realize that the problems of conflict  crisis and terrorism cannot be solved within a few years.   Many times today we heard that the United Nations is entering a new stage. We believe that this will be a phase of its greatness  because we have learned from the past that this great world experiment  which has many times passed the test on a global scale  will continue to do so in the near future.

"142",5725,"PRK",64,2009,"On behalf of the delegation of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea  I would like to congratulate Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. At the same time  I wish to express my hope that his skilful stewardship will lead the current session to success.  The sixty-fourth session of the General Assembly will mark an end to the first decade of a new century  which humankind has ushered in with a great deal of anticipation and aspiration. One of the major tasks facing the Assembly this year is to conduct an impartial review of this first decade and set the correct path ahead.  Humankind has yet to realize its long-cherished desire to thrive in a peaceful and equitable world free from war  while its hopes are confronted with a host of serious challenges one after the other. The Afghan war is in escalation and the Iraq war is still undecided. The cold wind of a nuclear arms race is blowing  even before negotiations on nuclear disarmament have been opened. Avian influenza is not completely subdued  yet a new strain of H1N1 flu is sweeping the world. The world is undergoing a much greater degree of global warming this year than last  and we are witnessing more stagnant economies and many more people out of work everywhere.  The United Nations Security Council has become more arrogant  resulting in further inequality and double standards in international relations. We need to direct serious attention to this prevailing reality when we review the first decade of the new century.  The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea  under the leadership of the great General Kim Jong Il  has now entered a phase of State-building. A great  prosperous and powerful nation is a country in which national power is strong and everything thrives and whose people live happily  with nothing to envy in the world. To build such a country was the lifelong wish of the great leader of our people President Kim Il Sung  and it is the firm intention and wish of the Government and people of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea that such a thriving nation will be a reality by 2012  the centenary of Kim Il Sung’s birth.  The main task facing us over the next three years is to concentrate all our efforts on building an economic power  which is the last height we need to scale in building a great  prosperous and powerful nation. The Korean peninsula remains as ever in a state of armistice. But now that we possess a dependable   49 09-52604  nuclear deterrent  we may be able to prevent war and defend peace. For more than half a century our country was compelled to produce guns rather than butter  as we suffered under nuclear threats and the danger of war posed by hostile forces. But today we have settled down to channel our efforts into building a great  prosperous and powerful nation. To all intents and purposes  this is completely the result of the Songun-based politics instituted by the great General Kim Jong Il. And  when our country becomes an economic power  that will create new impetus to the economic development of the region. Our efforts to build up the economy will constitute a significant part of the international community’s efforts to attain the United Nations Millennium Development Goals.  We have never opposed the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and the rest of the world. Denuclearization was the wish of President Kim Il Sung  and a nuclear-free world is a long-cherished desire of mankind.  The Korean people are more devoted to the sovereignty and peace of their country than any other people or nation in the world  as a result of the characteristics of their country’s historical development. The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea has done its utmost to bring about the peaceful reunification of the country  to eliminate nuclear threats and grounds for war and to secure peace and stability on the Korean peninsula. We initiated the denuclearization of North-East Asia and of the Korean peninsula and put forward the proposals for the Armistice Agreement to be replaced by a peace agreement and for the adoption of a non-aggression pact between the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and the United States.  However  our efforts have not received an appropriate response from the United States. The United States considers the Korean issue only in the light of its Asia strategy and does not want to see the entire Korean peninsula denuclearized. That has resulted in a greater nuclear threat facing the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. The arbitrariness of the United States can be seen in the claim that the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is not allowed to launch even a peaceful satellite. The Security Council is being manipulated by that arbitrariness.  We have concluded that  as long as the United States does not change its existing nuclear policy  we have no option but to rely on our nuclear capability in order to ensure the nuclear balance in the region and preserve peace and stability in North-East Asia. The denuclearization of the Korean peninsula depends on whether or not the United States changes its nuclear policy towards Korea. In order to realize the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula  the United States Administration must discard its long-standing policy of confrontation and put into practice the change that it has recently talked about on several occasions.  We are not engaged in a nuclear arms race. The purpose of our nuclear weapon is to deter war. We will only possess a nuclear deterrent so as to avert a military attack or the threat of such an attack against our country. Deterrence will be directly proportional to the threat on the Korean peninsula  as in Europe and elsewhere. As long as it possesses nuclear weapons  the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea will act responsibly with regard to their management  use and non-proliferation  and to nuclear disarmament. We share the position of all peaceful countries  including the non-aligned countries  in opposing nuclear war  the nuclear arms race and the proliferation of nuclear weapons.  United Nations sanctions have now been imposed on us on the grounds that we had a nuclear deterrent. It may be recalled that the United Nations was set up in the country that produced the first nuclear weapon and that all five permanent members of the Security Council are nuclear Powers. If those countries had demonstrated their commitment to nuclear disarmament a long time ago and had refrained from arbitrarily and selectively opposing the peaceful satellite launch of another country  the nuclear situation in the world might have developed differently.  The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea attaches importance to the principle of sovereign equality enshrined in the United Nations Charter. The principle of sovereign equality is also the reason why we became a Member of the United Nations. Unjust and selective sanctions will never be recognized or accepted. The position of the Government of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is to respond to dialogue with dialogue and to sanctions by strengthening nuclear deterrence. If the United States brings sanctions to the talks  we will  for our part     09-52604 50  participate in such talks by bolstering our nuclear deterrence.  Thanks to the far-sighted bold decision of the great General Kim Jong Il  North-South relations on the Korean peninsula have entered a new phase. Just over a year ago  the North and the South had to adapt to changes owing to the differences in the positions of the two parties towards the historic joint declaration of 15 June and the declaration of 4 October  which were recognized and supported by the General Assembly.  However  our sincere and noble efforts paved the way for a turning point so as to reach a common understanding of those grand programmes for reunification. Inter-Korean economic cooperation  including the operation of the Kaesong industrial complex  is back on track and separated families can be reunited. In the future  the Government of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea will also continue to make all possible efforts to achieve national reconciliation and unity and to bring forward the independent and peaceful reunification of the country under the banner of “by our nation itself”.  All Member States have accepted the need for United Nations reform  as the new century requires. Currently  the Security Council is the most anachronistic organ of the United Nations. An imbalance in relations  by which the strong nations have ruled the weaker ones for the past half century  remains part of the structure of the Security Council  and it is precisely in the rules of procedure of that Council that democracy is least developed. Today  the General Assembly is the only place in the United Nations where the views of the international community can be properly reflected and democracy ensured.  In order to strengthen the role of the United Nations in line with the requirement of the times and the new situation  it is important to thoroughly democratize the Security Council and to substantially increase the authority of the General Assembly. In restructuring the Security Council  we should first consider the issues that can be resolved  such as the expansion of non-permanent members of the Security Council on the principle of ensuring the full representation of non-aligned and other developing countries  which make up the majority of the United Nations Member States.  In enhancing the authority of the General Assembly  we need to discuss the issue of submitting decisions of the Security Council to the General Assembly for approval  in particular all decisions relating to the principle of sovereign equality laid down in the United Nations Charter. The United Nations is required to have the proper criteria and principles in order to examine human rights issues. The United Nations Charter recognizes the rights of national self-determination and choice and the principle of non-interference in internal affairs  and all international human rights instruments contain the basic principle of the non-politicization of human rights.  However  these days some debates in the United Nations contradict that. Any attempt to bring into question the systems of specific countries and to interfere in their internal affairs under the guise of the protection of human rights is  in itself  a violation of human rights  denying the right of the people of those countries to choose their own system. The United Nations should pay attention to the fact that its human rights agenda covers only the situations found in small countries  with no mention of large ones  the West and European countries. Due attention should also be given to how to boost the role of the non-aligned and other developing countries in the international arena.  International efforts to attain the Millennium Development Goals and to address the central issues of the United Nations  such as the global economic crisis and climate change  urgently call for the active participation of a wide range of developing countries  including the Non-Aligned Movement.  The foreign policy of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea has been  is and will be based on the principles of independence  peace and friendship. The Government of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea will actively strive to further strengthen and develop friendly and cooperative relations with all United Nations Member States under those principles  and to fully discharge its commitment towards defending the peace and security of the Korean peninsula and the rest of the world.

"143",5770,"PRT",64,2009,"I wish the President all the best for this General Assembly. Along with Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon  he can count on Portugal’s firm support in his work. Allow me to begin by endorsing fully Sweden’s intervention as the country holding the presidency of the European Union.  Fighting climate change is both a moral imperative and a matter of survival. This is no longer a long-term issue. Its consequences are evident everywhere; from the small island States to Portugal  we can all witness it. The time to act is now. I congratulate the Secretary-General on the timely high-level meeting on climate change. The objective of mobilizing political will and vision for the climate negotiations has been fulfilled. The process of political consciousness-raising is done. Governments are now better prepared to take the decisions necessary for an ambitious agreement in Copenhagen. At December’s Climate Change Summit  every State should take on bold commitments  to the extent that their respective responsibilities and capacities allow  so that the post-2012 world can meet the challenge. If  however  we leave Copenhagen with limited results and small  insignificant reforms  we will be failing in our historic responsibilities.  We are all affected by climate change  but it is obvious that the consequences are not equally distributed. The least developed countries and small island States  despite being the lowest polluters  suffer the most from the effects of climate change  and their greater vulnerability imposes a larger responsibility on the international community. Being part of a community means having a responsibility to the other members of the community; so  when we talk about the international community  we automatically imply that it is our duty to support these countries in their adaptation and mitigation efforts.  The General Assembly’s resolution 63/281  on the impact of climate change on global security  is a good step forward. But it must be followed up. The United Nations should promote in-depth debates on this matter at all relevant levels during the session we are now starting. Portugal is a country that has built its history through an extraordinary relationship with the sea. It is  therefore  natural for us to promote the sustainable development of oceans and their resources with a coherent and coordinated approach. We see this as a strategic issue for the whole world. In this regard  Portugal has contributed in multiple contexts  including to the maritime policy of the European Union and the ocean strategy of the Community of Portuguese Speaking Countries (CPLP).  The preservation of the environment must also tackle the energy question. Climate change brings challenges but also great opportunities. Fully conscious of this  Portugal is strongly committed to renewable energy sources: solar  wind  hydro  biomass and wave power. In 2010 we plan to produce 45 per cent of our energy from renewable sources. By 2020 we will reach 60 per cent. Furthermore  Portugal has one of the lowest carbon-emission rates per capita in the European Union  and we are ready to share our experience in this area with all interested Member States.  A year ago  when we gathered in this Hall for the opening of the sixty-third session of the Assembly  the world was waking up to an economic and financial crisis that we are still dealing with today. Recent positive signs bear witness to the results of international cooperation in the face of this common threat  but we are aware that the effects of this crisis continue to be felt in the daily lives of millions of people all over the world  and that the most vulnerable are once again the main victims. We are convinced that the international financial system must be guided by principles of responsibility and transparency  and that regulation and supervision must be strengthened. We can and should make sure that international markets are based on the values  principles and standards of conduct that we share.  We should also ensure that the benefits of economic globalization have a more universal impact. The United Nations Global Compact is an important contribution to this end. The solution to this issue was not  is not and will never be protectionism. Closing the door on our neighbours and partners means leaving people in poverty and failing to solve our medium- to long-term domestic problems. It is therefore crucial that we bring the Doha Round to a rapid conclusion in a way that corresponds fully to the sustainable global development objectives that have been outlined. At the same time  we renew our firm commitment to the Millennium Development Goals. We cannot allow the economic crisis to affect the gains we have achieved through this process. A State that forgets the common good will sooner or later find instability  poverty and    09-52604 52  insecurity knocking at its door. Portugal  with its sense of collective responsibility and international cohesion  will continue to contribute to the limits of its capacity.  We concentrate a large part of our action on development aid in Africa  where poverty is most marked. In this regard  I would like to mention that Portugal is currently a co-president of the Africa Partnership Forum and  in this capacity  in concert with our African partners  we have communicated to the G-20 the specific concerns and interests of the continent in areas such as the response to the economic and financial crisis and climate change. In the context of Africa  we continue to be firmly committed to implementing the first European Union Action Plan and Common Strategy  adopted at the second European Union and Africa Summit in Lisbon in December 2007.  Allow me at this point to salute the people of Guinea-Bissau for their conduct of the recent elections in their country. It is now up to the Guinean institutions to maintain and consolidate peace and stability  and it is up to the international community to increase its assistance in order to strengthen the building of institutions and security sector reform in Guinea-Bissau. Portugal will continue to be strongly committed to this process  bearing in mind the wishes expressed by the democratically elected institutions of Guinea-Bissau.  This month we celebrate the tenth anniversary of the self-determination referendum of Timor-Leste  and we take this opportunity to pay a heartfelt tribute to the East-Timorese people. The referendum was the corollary of the affirmation of Timor-Leste’s identity and its admirable will towards peace and development as a sovereign nation.  Guinea-Bissau and Timor-Leste are two countries that demonstrate the growing involvement of the Community of Portuguese Speaking Countries in promoting peace  democracy  human rights  political stability and social and economic development. One of the fundamental pillars of that organization  over which Portugal currently presides  is the promotion of the Portuguese language  one of the five most widely spoken languages in the world and the vehicle of communication for more than 250 million people  connecting States and peoples in all corners of the world. It is therefore ever more pressing and fair that Portuguese be made an official or working language in international organizations. Portugal is also assuming the pro tempore presidency of the Ibero-American Conference on Culture  whose summit will take place this year in Estoril  Portugal  with innovation and knowledge as its theme.  In this regard  I wish to emphasize that  as President of the CPLP and the Ibero-American Conference  Portugal has  through regional institutions and organizations  supported the participation and involvement of emerging economies and developing countries in the debate over the reform of the international financial system.  Regarding the situation in Honduras  we call for the speedy re-establishment of democratic and constitutional legality  and we recall the inviolability of the diplomatic mission of Brazil  under the principles of the Vienna Convention.  The CPLP and the Ibero-American Conference are true paradigms of intercontinental cooperation  based on a communion of cultures and values. We also consider these paradigms to be the spirit and the essence of the Alliance of Civilizations. Thus  it is with great satisfaction that we witness the enormous progress in the work of the Alliance and that we shall participate in the Third Forum of the Alliance  to be held in Brazil in 2010  which will be an event in which the CPLP will have a special role. I take this opportunity to congratulate the High Representative of the Secretary-General for his Office’s valuable work.  Portugal is proud to have been among the first signatories of the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic  Social and Cultural Rights  which has just been opened for signature. We call on all States Members of the United Nations to do so as well  so that this new international human rights instrument may enter into effect and bring about respect for all human rights for every human being.  Equally fundamental in the defence and promotion of human dignity is the continuous action of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees  as well as the recent appointment of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Violence against Children. In both cases I would like to highlight the committed  tireless and effective way in which they have assumed their responsibilities.  Terrorism and the proliferation of nuclear weapons are the greatest challenges to international peace and security. In combating these threats it is   53 09-52604  essential that we implement the respective international regimes and continue to invest in international cooperation  in particular in the framework of the United Nations. All States that signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty must honour their obligations without reservations.  Regarding the maintenance of international peace and security  we have never demanded so much from the United Nations. If peacekeeping operations are to have the outcome that they deserve  clear  credible and achievable mandates are absolutely necessary  as is the engagement of all Member States through contribution of personnel.  Portugal has assumed its share  with both financial and operational contributions. More than 20 000 members of Portuguese armed forces and 3 000 from the Portuguese police forces have participated so far in peacekeeping operations. Today  we have peacekeepers in Timor-Leste  Lebanon  Afghanistan and Chad.  One of the main challenges to international peace and security is the conflict in the Middle East. Portugal reiterates its support for a two-State solution  with the creation of an independent  democratic and viable Palestinian State  to exist side by side in peace and security with the State of Israel. But to attain this objective it is paramount that Palestine have a territory that enables it to exist as a State.  In this context  Portugal will continue to support all efforts  in particular those of Egypt and the United States  for the return to the negotiation process in accordance with Security Council resolution 1860 (2009) and in accordance with the principles contained in the various peace initiatives  particularly the Arab Peace Initiative. We are living in a time of opportunity  and it is fundamental that the increasingly united opinion of the international community be fully listened to by the parties.  In Iraq and in Afghanistan  we welcome the progress achieved in the past few years  but we recognize the need for the continued commitment of the international community. I hereby affirm the guarantee that Portugal will continue to assume its share of the burden.  Climate change  the financial and economic crisis  sustainable development  human rights  threats to the international peace and security: to face such a vast array of global challenges  there is no more appropriate forum than the United Nations  no other strategic agent that may transmit our collective response.  Today  more than ever  the collective interest reflects the national concern of each of us. Today  more than ever  I subscribe to Dag Hammarskjöld’s vision of a United Nations as a dynamic instrument to develop means of executive action that is not limited to being simply a mechanism consisting of static conferences for the resolution of conflicts of interests and ideologies. To ensure that the multilateralism we profess is truly effective  to ensure that the primacy of the United Nations in international politics and the respect for international law is not mere rhetoric  to ensure that this Organization is increasingly more like the dynamic instrument that Dag Hammarskjöld envisioned  we must further the reform of the United Nations. We must seek in this General Assembly a broad consensus that will enable what we all know is necessary to take place  namely  the reform of the Security Council.  In so doing we should ask ourselves whether a Security Council without Brazil and India as permanent members  and where Africa is not represented with that same status  is a truly representative Council. Is it consistent to defend a more efficient and transparent Organization and yet to have a Security Council without reform of its working methods?  Let us not be satisfied with merely a discussion of a better Organization. Let us build together a more efficient  transparent and representative United Nations.  Since 2000  Portugal has been a candidate for a non-permanent seat in the Security Council for the biennium 2011-2012. Our candidacy is consistent with the history of our engagement with the United Nations  our capacity to listen and dialogue with other peoples and cultures  and our commitment towards fair and balanced solutions in international issues. We are a candidate in the name of representativeness and the right of all countries  including those of small and medium size  which constitute the majority of the Members of this Organization  to be present in the Security Council. We are a candidate for the benefit of sustainable development and on behalf of the human values that bind us together  of the inalienable rights of    09-52604 54  all human beings and of our common aspiration for a more just and peaceful world."
"144",5816,"PRY",64,2009,"I should like at the outset to express my sincerest congratulations to Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki on his election to preside over the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. I also wish to express the thanks of the delegation of Paraguay to Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann  President of the Assembly at its sixty-third session  for the progress made during his tenure.   I wish to begin by discussing what is most important: life. I cannot forget that  while the first paragraph of the preamble of the Charter of the United Nations states that our peoples  gathered together  are determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war  the murderous onslaught of warplanes has continued to kill  mutilate and traumatize children in many civilian populations; in national coffers  amounts allocated to the death budget  glibly labelled “defence expenditures”  continue to swell; and the military industries of the world’s most powerful countries continue to reap the most lucrative benefits without any questions from politicians or any outrage on the part of the international news networks  in a game of perverse hypocrisy that is undermining our future with lies disguised as imposed truths.  We are very rigorous in estimating the high global costs of containing and providing public health insurance for pandemics such as H1N1 influenza. But we forget that our “defence expenditures”  promoted by the great weapons industries from high  snow-covered summits of complacency  end up exchanging a container of vaccine for a rifle or a significant part of the public health budget for a warplane.   The United Nations was born to promote peace and to eradicate war. However  the voracious traffic in   31 09-52425  arms continues to pass through our countries with its convoys of machine guns  missiles and grenades. Select regions of the world continue to be opportunistic enclaves for the trade of the merchants of death. Conflicts that mutilate  destroy and kill neighbours and condemn them forever to disgrace are at the same time opportunities for those who profit by  foment  create and manage the business of war.  Who questions the bloodstained bank notes that lie untouched in the vaults of the most powerful bank? We are face to face in this Hall  but truly we  the Governments of the countries of the world  rich  poor and very poor  are face to face with history. If we could just for one minute believe in the great tenets of equality and the shared rights of the human race  it would be time enough to ask ourselves the question: How much longer will the warlords continue to maximize their future income on the physical elimination of human beings?  My country  Paraguay  declares before the world that we are absolutely committed to peace. My Government is not prepared to spend the cost of a loaf of bread on weapons or war machinery. Any investment in defence must be the bare minimum compared to the social expenditures of the Government. Paraguay will not pawn its daily bread to dance the blind waltz of the warlords.   We believe that  in the context of globalization  there should be a call for the creation of a new world economic order capable of eliminating the sharp contrasts of the present and the clearly unequal access to the benefits of contemporary development. In that respect  I should like to describe the reality of life in Paraguay today. Our situation is essentially very similar to that of other countries that are also at the mercy of serious socio-economic problems.   A little more than a year ago  a historic transition occurred in Paraguay that left our economy in tatters — with backward and obsolete production mechanisms  weak democratic institutions rife with corruption  barely credible political parties and a lack of channels for civic participation in the decision-making process. Society was riven by serious contrasts  including about 40 per cent of the population living in poverty  tens of thousands of unemployed  high levels of migration  and unscrupulous minorities who lived well and sought to perpetuate their illegitimate privileges.   Those traits are shared by the majority of countries represented here  which  over and above their individual circumstances  like Paraguay are facing the threefold challenge of modernizing their economies  strengthening their participatory democracies  and eliminating serious and severe social inequities. As in Paraguay  in all poor countries the causes of the scourges we have suffered can be traced to the entrenchment of systems without justice or equality that ultimately widen the gaps between the rich countries and the poor.  We have sought in vain to mask the failures of the policies of recent decades with ostensibly technical terms that do little to describe the pathetic global reality. For example  we speak of least developed countries  middle-income countries and developing countries when the simple fact is that today we live in a world where there are countries that benefit until they can benefit no longer from world growth  while others are left behind and condemned to poverty.  Since the United Nations was established  our unavoidable obligation has been to proceed fearlessly to change that reality. We must give serious thought to a new world economic order with simple and specific aims. First  we must promote and strengthen small economies based on the fair and equitable distribution of the benefits of the production of wealth. We must put an end to inequitable trade relationships and develop effective policies of solidarity with those countries that endure adverse geographical or climate conditions.   Secondly  we must promote the healthy political development of all nations of the world and ensure that the most powerful countries do not interfere in local affairs  above all when these interventions seek to destabilize genuine democratic processes. I would like to clearly reaffirm my concern over events in the brotherly Republic of Honduras following the savage coup d’état that opened a gaping wound in the heart of our regional democracy.  Thirdly  we must promote peaceful solutions to international conflicts  firmly resolved to reduce the alarming levels of militarization and armament.   Fourthly  we must advocate an end to the harmful criminal attacks on the environment  including global warming and the natural disasters that occur with increasing frequency. We the peoples of the South are paying the growing and unsustainable social     09-52425 32  environmental and financial costs of climate change. In the meantime  those States that bear greatest responsibility for global warming are not shouldering their obligations or the growing socio-environmental debt that they generate. They are perpetuating and aggravating a clearly unjust situation that must be reversed. As a matter of justice and urgency  we must heed the calls of the most vulnerable people on the planet.   Fifthly and finally  we must promote gender equality and put an end to discrimination of all kinds based on sexual  political or ideological preferences or racial  ethnic or religious differences. In sum  it is a matter of developing a better and more humane world on the way towards a kinder living environment that is more supportive and much more in keeping with the future of humankind.   I am fully aware of the scope of the challenge that I am suggesting. I am also completely aware of the difficulties that we will encounter in this epic fight  but in the twenty-first century we cannot continue to overlook an in-depth and open debate on realities of concern.  I do not in any way underestimate the relevant role that the United Nations has played in its relatively short existence in promoting world peace and equitable social development  but we must not ignore the decades of failure with regard to comprehensive modernization  much less fail to creatively and resolutely make use of the greatest world forum of today.  There is no time to lose. Historical justice and redress of the rich countries to the poor ones must be a priority on the agenda of the United Nations. In order for the United Nations to meet that important goal  we must support the General Assembly’s adoption of the necessary reforms  so as to reaffirm its inherent nature as a representative  democratic and equitable organ. We must uphold the precedence of its bodies over other internal organs of the Organization  such as the Security Council  in order to underscore the processes that will help build that greatly desired social justice.  The Security Council  as the organ entrusted with the maintenance of world peace  must also be reformed  not only so as to give it greater legitimacy by increasing its representativeness  but also so as to adopt new working methods to reflect a new multi-centred world order  founded on relations of cooperation  solidarity and peace  in which the community and human dignity are at the centre of every decision.   It is difficult to say this in such a hallowed Hall but it is worth recalling that  at this very moment  thousands of people are dying of hunger in the world that we shape. The ease with which television news switches between pictures of pitiful children overpowered by appalling hunger and figures for the brutal arms business of the industrialized countries exposes human indifference.   Once and for all  we must believe in — and create — a different planet that is able to retrieve its vast natural wealth  having put an end to the terrible havoc wrought by petty interests. We must believe in a fairer and more balanced international economic system  in which the huge discrepancies are a thing of the past. I believe in the great solidarity of human beings. I believe in the dreams of great leaders who defiantly changed the world. I believe in Jesus Christ  in Gandhi and in Martin Luther King.  Before ending my comments  I would like to take this opportunity to set out some clear positions on pressing matters that affect us.  First  I would like to say that the economic crisis that began in the major Powers and spread worldwide has had serious consequences in all countries. It has brought about a rapid destruction of accumulated wealth. Unemployment has risen to unprecedented levels. The number of poor has increased. The crisis has jeopardized dozens of democratic political processes.   Secondly  I would like to resolutely state that the violent rupture in the constitutional process in Honduras is a tremendous setback for the re-democratization of Latin America. Those involved in the coup who dealt a resounding blow to the honourable face of the continent’s democracy are responsible for the human sacrifices and the tremendous social unrest that is taking place. I would like to state my explicit solidarity and that of my people with Manuel Zelaya and the people of Honduras  who are bravely standing up to the effects of the coup.  Thirdly  I would ask the peoples and the Governments represented here to vigorously condemn the trade embargo that the largest economy in the   33 09-52425  world imposes on Cuba — another intolerable chapter that  while it lasts  undermines the credibility of any discussion on pluralism  tolerance and humanism in these forums. We have complete faith in a new vision that breaks with the past and its uncompromising divisions. We believe that the hopes of Latin America and the Caribbean with regard to the humanistic approach towards Cuba of the new leadership of the most powerful country on Earth will be met sooner than later.  Fourthly and lastly  I would like to state open concern about the sinister currents circling in the world with the unbridled arms race that can in no way be justified and can only be welcomed by the industries of death and barbarity. We must defuse the tensions that foster that interest in weapons and we must urgently clarify the elements that obscure the prospect for peace throughout the world.   I reaffirm the commitment of my small and humble country to supporting any and all initiatives that seek to build a better world for future generations."
"145",5835,"PSE",64,2009,"I congratulate you  Sir  on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly. I wish you every success in your noble mission and recognize your long experience in international political affairs. I also extend our greetings and thanks to former President  His Excellency Father Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann  whose positions and active efforts reflected the spirit and principles of this international organization  which is headed by His Excellency Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon  whom I also salute. I express our appreciation for everything he has done personally and through the organs and agencies of the United Nations  notably the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA)  to assist the Palestinian people and defend their rights.   During this session we have a full agenda before us. The peoples of the whole world are looking to this body to determine what can be done to save our planet from the effects of climate change and global warming and to address the world financial crisis. Many countries  including small and developing countries  see the need to reform the United Nations  including the Security Council  so as to reflect the reality of the current international situation and to ensure more comprehensive representation of the international community.   These common concerns must not overshadow the fact that serious problems face the Middle East region in particular  first and foremost the lack of commitment to the Charter of the United Nations and the extent to which the resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council are actually being implemented without the application of double standards. Everyone agrees on the need to achieve peace in the Middle East  to counter extremism and violence  and to establish the region as a zone free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. Yet the larger wound and deeper tragedy remains the suffering of our Palestinian people since the Nakba — the catastrophe — more than 60 years ago  to which the United Nations is a living witness. Its archives contain not dozens but hundreds of resolutions that have not been implemented.  The suffering of the Palestinian people as a result of Israel’s settler occupation is crystal clear to the world. Since the occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip  including East Jerusalem  in 1967  Israel has continued with its settlement policy on all Palestinian land  especially in holy Jerusalem  where that policy is being accelerated and escalated by many means  including the seizure of the homes of Palestinians in the city  the imposition of restrictions  even preventing Palestinians from building and sometimes from repairing their homes while new settlement neighbourhoods are established. Jerusalem is becoming completely isolated from its surroundings because of the illegal settlements and the apartheid wall.  We now face a unique situation. If international law stipulates the inadmissibility of the acquisition of the territory of others by force  how can we then deal with the current situation where Israeli settlement policies are undermining the goal of establishing a geographically contiguous Palestinian State in implementation of the will of the international consensus? That consensus is reflected in the many resolutions and principles  including the Road Map  which we all agreed upon and which is based on the   31 09-52463  principle of land for peace and on an end to the occupation that began in 1967.  Immense efforts have been exerted and many conferences have been held over the years  particularly since the signing of the Oslo Accords in 1993. Yet all of this has not led to an end to the conflict. President Barack Obama gave much hope to our people and the peoples of the region when he announced his vision for a peace agreement on the basis of a two-State solution and the cessation of all settlement activities. We welcomed the active American diplomacy to revive the peace process and all efforts of the international Quartet and its members: the United Nations  the European Union  the Russian Federation and the United States.   All these active efforts and initiatives  which have been welcomed and supported by us and by the Arab States  are however confronted by the intransigence of Israel  which refuses to adhere to the requirements for relaunching the peace process. How is it conceivable that negotiations can be held on the borders and on Jerusalem while Israeli bulldozers are working to change the reality on the ground with the aim of creating a new reality and imposing the borders that Israel desires? How can one conceive of holding negotiations without agreement on the terms of reference and the objective of those negotiations  which the whole world has unanimously agreed upon  namely ending the Israeli occupation of the territories occupied in 1967  establishing the State of Palestine  with Jerusalem as its capital  reaching a just and agreed upon solution to the question of Palestinian refugees on the basis of resolution 194 (III) of 1948  and achieving peace on all the Palestinian  Syrian and Lebanese tracks  as affirmed in the Arab Peace Initiative  which provides a precious opportunity that must be seized to achieve peace?  In this regard  I should like to express our deep appreciation of the important speech delivered to the Assembly by President Obama two days ago (see )  in which he affirmed the necessity of ending the occupation that began in 1967 and the illegitimacy of the settlements. He also stressed the need to establish an independent  sovereign and viable Palestinian State and to address all the final-status issues in the negotiations  foremost among these Jerusalem  refugees  borders  water and settlements  along with others. We reiterate that adherence to these principles  in addition to a complete freeze on all settlement activities  can salvage the peace process and open horizons for its success.  I reaffirm the eagerness of the Palestine Liberation Organization to achieve a just  lasting and comprehensive peace in accordance with the resolutions of international legitimacy. At the same time  I caution that the settlement policy and the building of the separation wall  which continue to be pursued by the Israeli occupation  will abort opportunities to relaunch the peace process. Time is running out and the risks are becoming greater as a result of the continued suffering of the Palestinian people under the last remaining occupation in the world.   We call upon the international community to uphold international law and international legitimacy and to exert pressure on Israel to cease its settlement activities  to comply with the agreements it has signed  to cease its policies of occupation and colonial settlement  to release the approximately 11 000 prisoners and detainees and to lift the unjust siege imposed on the Gaza Strip  which was subjected months ago to devastating aggression claiming thousands of civilian casualties among and causing unprecedented destruction of infrastructure and public facilities  including hospitals  mosques  schools and even United Nations facilities.  Our people  which continues to demand its rights and to be determined to remain in its homeland despite all of the suffering caused by the detentions  the blockade and the killings  is also keen to end internal division and to restore national unity. Our sister  Egypt  is making commendable efforts to achieve that goal.   In spite of all our suffering from the occupation and its practices  we continue to work to build and develop our national institutions. We have made significant progress in this regard both in upholding the rule of law and public order and in promoting economic and social development  despite the harsh conditions of the occupation and the blockade. We continue to make every possible effort for the success of the efforts of our brothers in Egypt to end the ongoing coup in the Gaza Strip and to restore our national unity by resorting to the ballot box and holding presidential and legislative elections on their constitutional date under the supervision and control of Arab and Islamic countries  the United Nations and the    09-52463 32  international community. In that way  democracy will be firmly institutionalized in our political life.  Hope will remain alive in our souls and we will not despair of regaining our rights on the basis of relevant resolutions of the United Nations  the historic role of which we reaffirm for attaining peace and upholding the principle of “might for right” and not “right for might”.   From this rostrum  I conclude by reaffirming our commitment to the Road Map  the Arab Peace Initiative and to all terms of reference of the political process. We call upon all parties to respect and abide by them to provide the opportunity to launch a successful and effective peace process. We are confident that all our brothers in sisterly Arab countries will adhere to the Arab Peace Initiative as a basis for safeguarding our rights and opening the way towards genuine peaceful relations with Israel once the occupation is ended and the independent State of Palestine is established."
"146",5881,"QAT",64,2009,"Allow me at the outset  Sir  to congratulate you on your election to    09-52179 30  the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. I wish you every success in your task.  I would also like to thank your predecessor  my friend Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann  for his tireless work during the previous session.  I would also like to thank His Excellency Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his effort to strengthen the role of the United Nations.  This new session of the General Assembly coincides with a unique international situation — one of those situations that take shape at a critical juncture of major historical developments. Such situations present an opportunity to lay foundations  stress principles and regulate systems of international interaction and relations.  In our view  the present situation is similar to those that prevailed on the eve of the conferences of Vienna (1814)  Versailles (1919) and Potsdam (1945).  This situation  and the opportunity it presents in today’s world  is fertile ground for embarking on a search for a different future. It comes in the wake of a period of violent turmoil in which the world was burned by the fires of World War II  was bitten by the frost of the cold war  and went adrift — especially after the 11 September 2001 tragedy — in the fallout from the war on terrorism. This was followed by the financial market crisis just last year.  The succession of major developments has altered the world map  changed the balance of power and influence  and brought in capable parties from Europe  Asia  Latin America  the Middle East and Africa. It has also generated a renewal-seeking movement in the United States of America that we are following with interest and we sincerely hope will succeed.  We note that during the stages of the global confrontation and polarization  and the significant turmoil that followed both of them  the international community lived in  and suffered from  severe confusion  when it became clear that achieving world peace and prosperity required more than the weapons of the mighty Powers  more than a bipolarity of States  more than the hegemony of one country — no matter how advanced that country might be — and a broader and more comprehensive global management of urgent crises.  In such a situation  the significance of the opportunity looms large  after long years of firestorms  snow blizzards and dust storms  signalling to us that the world requires something new. In fact  that obvious fact stands out against the background of our harsh prior experience.  However  we have been failing to pay attention to it  despite the numerous appeals pointing to it and the sincere attempts calling for renewal so that the Organization can fulfil its mission in changing times and remain a standard and reference of international legitimacy. This requirement for change covers the whole of the United Nations system with all its branches and agencies.  It is clear to us that the serious crises of the world were exacerbated when nations with major influence in the international order decided to transfer tackling the most important issues of war  peace and progress from the United Nations framework to other extraneous frameworks.  Such was the case with regard to conventional and nuclear arms  security agreements and arrangements covering the broad spectrum from outer space to policy and economics. The reasons given for going outside the United Nations framework were  as some believed  that such issues were beyond the capability of the smaller States that represent the majority of United Nations Members.  Thus  according to this approach  the absence of the smaller States would make dealing with the issues at hand easier. But in the emerging circumstances and realities  those who advocate the monopolizing of international decision-making need to realize that we live in one world. And in a world like this one  concern is equal  even though the distribution of power may not be.  This attitude represents for us a confirmation of our view  by which we stand firm. Namely  that it is time to go back to the United Nations system as a framework that accommodates everyone  provides a venue recognized by all  and has a Charter accepted by all nations mindful that equal rights do not run counter to a division of responsibilities which takes into account the different levels of capability of the parties.  We are aware and appreciative of the great importance of an overarching international authority as expressed by a legitimate international order and   31 09-52179  governed by a Charter  by the law  and by an experience of a harsh and bloody political history. That appreciation stems from our intimate familiarity with the crises and complex situations of the Middle East  which became intertwined and increasingly ominous when addressed outside the United Nations framework  on the assumption that the new setting could yield swifter and more effective solutions. In fact  that approach was merely an aimless diversion that only caused greater confusion and complexity.  Resorting to the authority of the United Nations is essential not only to resolve intractable crises such as the ones in the Middle East  but also to realize aspirations that can be fulfilled only through a legitimate international consensus and within an agreed framework. One such pressing crisis is the quest for alternative energy sources. Another equally urgent issue is that of climate change and its definite impact on the environment and life on this planet.  As for the issue of energy  while it would seem that oil-producing countries are benefiting from continued world dependence on their oil production  I wish to stress to the Assembly that we consider global security to be our security and global prosperity to be our prosperity. There can be neither peace nor prosperity when global civilization is threatened by an energy crisis that is far greater than a war of any kind  even a nuclear war.  With regard to the issue of climate change  I should like to take this opportunity to thank His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon  Secretary-General of the United Nations  for having organized the Summit on Climate Change yesterday within the framework of the United Nations to discuss this most serious challenge  which threatens not only the security of the planet but also all life on it.  We believe that  while the United Nations system comprises a comprehensive range of institutions  those institutions require urgent renewal and strengthening so that United Nations work will be commensurate with the new realities in the community of nations on all continents. At this session  we face a historic situation — an opportunity that does not present itself very often. It is the duty of the international community  and in particular of its powerful members  to shoulder their responsibilities by responding to that opportunity.  Almighty God has blessed the State of Qatar with vast hydrocarbon resources  including the giant North Gas Field  whose resources make Qatar the third-largest country in the world in terms of natural gas reserves. Since the Field was discovered  the Government has sought to develop concepts and plans for projects to supply the local market with gas and to export liquefied natural gas to world markets  as well as for the gas-to-liquid process  petrochemical industries and other projects using natural gas  whose consumption is less harmful to the environment than that of other fossil substances. While the State of Qatar has sufficient reserves to meet its needs for decades to come  we are fully aware of the future challenges facing the international community in terms of the implications of greenhouse gas emissions  climate change and their negative effects on sustainable development projects.  The State of Qatar is aware of the enormous potential of clean and renewable energy sources — in particular solar energy  which is abundantly available in our climate. The Government has encouraged our industries  educational institutions and scientific research centres to develop renewable energy technologies that will help to improve efficiency and performance and are suited to local conditions.  The State of Qatar looks forward to a more intensive international effort to share information and expertise in the development of solar and other renewable energies. We urge developed countries to share modern technologies in that area and to contribute to the implementation and financing of renewable energy projects throughout the world."
"147",5927,"ROU",64,2009,"At the outset  I would like to address to Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki my warmest congratulations on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. I wish him every success in meeting this challenge.  My country is proud of its historic commitment to tolerance  fostering rapprochement and confidence-building in international debates. Romania has always demonstrated its resolve to enhance multilateralism  be it by bringing parties in conflict together  overcoming artificial boundaries or promoting cooperation between developed and developing countries.  I take this opportunity to pay tribute to an important event for Central and Eastern Europe  which we are commemorating this year. It has been 20 years since the autumn of change that reshaped Europe and opened the way to historic opportunities for the former Eastern bloc. Two decades have passed since the fall of the iron curtain  and we now recognize that the power for change that democracy represents is one of the most potent European values. It remains the hope of millions of young people throughout the world who defend freedom of expression  multi-party systems  respect for diversity and freedom of the press. We must never forget our history. After two decades of democratic change  we must never forget where we started. That is what now strengthens the values that are shared throughout Europe and that allow us better to understand democracy’s transformational sweep throughout the world.  We now face the most important challenges humanity has ever faced. The negative impact of climate change has only been exacerbated by the global financial and economic crisis  the food crisis  the rise in energy prices and pandemics. The world is experiencing increasingly tense situations that make our efforts to meet the challenges of the new century even more sensitive. We have now to address terrorism  the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction  prolonged conflicts  failed States  food and energy insecurity  migration  poverty and the violation of human rights.  I hope that  in the face of not just of one but of many challenges  Member States will make this situation an opportunity for visionary change. Through the implementation of solutions to the economic and financial crisis and responses to the negative effects of climate change  we can aspire to create greener economies and jobs  societies more responsible in their use of energy  improved infrastructure  and financial instruments strong enough to support such a transition. (spoke in English)  I would like to refer to a key topic on the United Nations agenda: climate change. I do not intend to reiterate all its negative effects or the danger it poses to the very existence of humankind. Members are well aware of all of them  and we have been speaking about them extensively over this past week. However  I do want to stress the principles that underpin Romania’s approach to this issue and that we would like to invite Members to consider as well.  Nature is part of our daily life. If we respect nature  we can take long-term benefits from it  making us better prepared to design and build our future. Respect is essential. We are all affected by climate change. There is no boundary to protect a certain country or a certain area. It is not as if something happening in the Pacific is not also the business of somebody living in a developed European capital. That means that we all have a common responsibility towards others. We must be aware that everything we do and any decision we take has an impact on others. That is why it is so important to base our decisions on such values as human respect  solidarity and responsibility.   41 09-52592   We commend the Secretary-General for his dedication and commitment in dealing with this issue. By bringing us together as world leaders seeking consensus on what is to be done about climate change  he has rallied us to work towards the Conference in Copenhagen. We expect an ambitious agreement to be reached in Copenhagen.  Another challenge that affects us all is that of the global financial and economic crisis. Again  solutions must be to the benefit of all. We need to join forces rapidly to resume economic growth and development  reform financial instruments and preserve international stability. The world financial system no longer meets the needs and realities of our time. The institutions monitoring that system have to be reformed. We need to create an early prevention and early warning mechanism  and the United Nations should be entrusted with more resources and prerogatives as the main coordinator for the delivery of global public goods. Our task will be to ensure discipline and predictability within the system  while preserving the freedom of the market as the main engine of economic growth. We welcome in this respect the commitments undertaken at the summit of the Group of Eight to discourage protectionism and ensure the conclusion of the Doha negotiations by 2010.  We need a twenty-first century multilateralism that is both innovative and pragmatic. Romania is devoted to that cause and seeks to expand its cooperation with the United Nations in ever more creative and pragmatic ways. To illustrate Romania’s interests and its more concrete contributions to the United Nations system  I am proud to point to just two major projects that came to fruition this year. The opening of the first emergency transit centre for refugees in Timisoara  the first such body in the world  was the result of excellent cooperation with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Organization for Migration. The second project is the signing  here in New York  of a memorandum of understanding between the Government of Romania and the United Nations regarding the training of United Nations close protection personnel within the Centre for Excellence of the Romanian Protection and Guard Service  to be opened soon in Bucharest.  In all our endeavours to identify a stronger multilateral approach to guaranteeing a safer and more sustainable system  we should all consider at least four essential elements. The first is managing the current economic crisis so as to secure sustainable development and growth. The second is staying focused on the demanding and interconnected issues of climate change  poverty  food security  health  energy  migration and the lack of democracy in some parts of the world  while maintaining international peace  security and stability. The third element concerns the consolidation of international law. The fourth concerns strengthening and increasing the efficiency of international institutions.  The United Nations and its bodies must be at the centre of this renewed multilateralism with what the Organization does best — promoting development and security while advancing democracy  human rights  the rule of law and social development. At the Millennium Summit  we all pledged to boost the role of this unique and indispensable Organization. Indeed  in recent years  the United Nations has undergone a wide-ranging process of realignment and reform. However  it is also very evident that reform of some of the most important United Nations bodies is still slow and inconsistent. I hope that  in the months and years to come we will see more progress in this respect.  Romania continues to share the view that the overarching goal of reforming the Security Council should be to achieve a more effective  transparent and representative body  and will join in any effort to that end. Since the intergovernmental negotiations in February  the reform process has shifted into a higher gear  allowing us to pursue the mandate set forth at the 2005 World Summit.  Another significant decision contained in the 2005 Outcome Document (resolution 60/1) concerns a crucial issue: the responsibility to protect. A few months ago  the General Assembly held a very constructive debate on how to implement this concept. The responsibility to protect is one of the most important conceptual evolutions for the United Nations. This path should be thoroughly explored by Member States  as it holds tremendous preventive potential.  Solutions to the challenges of the twenty-first century should also make more use of efficient regional mechanisms. I am referring to organizations such as the African Union  the Association of Southeast Asian Nations  the Gulf Cooperation Council  the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe     09-52592 42  and NATO  which are either cooperative bodies or ones directed towards regional integration.  The potential of smaller  knowledgeable groups of States to address the problems of a region is high. If supported  such regional groups can more easily muster political will and the capacity to act. This is particularly true in situations related to peace and security  where swift and decisive action is often required.  While serving its mandate in the Security Council in 2005  Romania promoted the Council’s resolution 1631 (2005)  which sought to strengthen cooperation between the United Nations and regional organizations in maintaining peace and security. Since then  a lot has been done in this respect  but the potential for action under Chapter VIII of the United Nations Charter is still to be fully unleashed.  Unfortunately  there are still crises around the globe that cannot be resolved by regional means alone. We continue to face protracted regional security challenges  such as those in the Middle East and various parts of Africa  as well as the South Caucasus and the Black Sea region. Reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan are turning out to be more complex and difficult than we all initially thought. Such situations require our undivided attention and comprehensive efforts.  My country is investing a great deal in the stability and security of the world. More than 1 500 Romanian troops serve in United Nations-mandated and -authorized missions in all areas of the globe  from Kosovo to Afghanistan  from Bosnia and Herzegovina to the Sudan. In recent years  Romania has been honoured to be able to participate  along with its allies and partners  in the stabilization and reconstruction of Iraq. At the end of June  Romanian troops concluded their mission there  leaving Iraq with the satisfaction of an accomplished mandate. The Iraqi security framework has improved significantly. The same could be done in Afghanistan. By keeping its commitment steady and deepening it when needed  it will be possible for the international community to succeed in consolidating a sovereign Afghan nation.  Among the perils that threaten us most  terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction remain of major concern. Nuclear proliferation is of particular concern  given the increasing accessibility of technology capable of large-scale destruction. In this context  we urge those Member States that are considering nuclear programmes to fully heed the concerns of the world community and to abide strictly by international norms and regulations.  Lately  there have been encouraging signs in the realm of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. We highly appreciate the recent agreement of the Presidents of the United States and the Russian Federation for nuclear arsenal cuts  confirming the commitments undertaken by those two States. As there have also been positive indications from the United States with respect to its ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty  the international community can now feel confident that the biggest nuclear Powers are determined to advance the nuclear disarmament process. (spoke in French)  It has been said that violence begets violence  but to ignore or not take into account the basic principles of human rights would be to do the same. In the same way  intolerance fuels further intolerance. We can debate historical themes  but we cannot deny history altogether. The tragedies  crimes against humanity and genocides are sins of the past  but they should also be lessons for the present and the future.  We have already demonstrated our willingness and capacity to accept our past in a critical way. Romania reiterates its commitment to combating extremism  xenophobia and all forms of racism and discrimination. At the same time  my country actively promotes diversity and multiculturalism  as well as intercultural and interreligious dialogue in the framework of the International Organization of la Francophonie and the Alliance of Civilizations.  Unfortunately  democracy is too often a slippery term in the diplomatic framework of the United Nations. But we cannot have a stable world and meet the challenges that face us without promoting certain values — freedom  democracy  the rule of law and respect for human rights — that have been of proven benefit to humanity. We must continue to help the men  women and children of the world to choose their future freely  enjoy decent employment and trust the authority of law and justice.  Democracy and the rule of law constitute the immune system of human society. Just as it is impossible to fight off disease when the immune   43 09-52592  system is weak  poverty spreads in a degraded environment. Whether it is a matter of creating equality in the areas of gender and health  achieving education for all or ensuring a clean environment  it is not merely a matter of funding  it is just as much about establishing the basic principles of human rights and democracy.  I should like to conclude by expressing my conviction that there is no challenge too great for our countries as long as we remain united. No threat is too powerful to destroy us if we succeed in mobilizing our wisdom and our capabilities."
"148",5973,"RUS",64,2009,"Today  speaking from this high rostrum  I would like to highlight five topics that are  in my view  important to all of us and our common approaches to the international agenda.  The first is the timing of this meeting and the moment that humankind is currently experiencing. This session of the General Assembly is taking place at a very critical and complex time. It can be said without exaggeration that we are living through one of the watershed moments of modern history. Besides the economic crisis — the first large-scale crisis of the era of globalization — global development as a whole continues to be threatened by regional and local conflicts  terrorism  cross-border crime  food shortages and climate change. The impact of the crisis continues to be felt by most countries of the world. Although so far we have been able  it seems  to avoid the very worst scenarios  the question remains: how to overcome the huge imbalances and deficits — amounting to trillions of dollars — accumulated in the global and national economies.  Our collective agenda for unification has been dictated by life itself  which also dictates the growing need for the United Nations as a time-tested mechanism for harmonizing the interests of different States and peoples. As never before  we are feeling the need for informal collective leadership and for an increased role for such platforms as the G-8 and the more recent G-20  as well as other negotiation and mediation forums  and all the more because these operate not on a model of opposition  but rather to advance the converging interests of their participants.  At this morning’s meeting  the President of the United States addressed this Assembly  and I would like to endorse one of the thoughts he voiced. He stated that no single country can or should attempt to dominate others  and that is absolutely true. However  these agreed approaches need to be implemented in some way  including through the United Nations system.  Another distinctive feature of modern times is the increasing role of regional entities  which are growing more active on every continent. This trend is entirely consistent with the principles of the United Nations. Russia  for its part — together with its partners in the Commonwealth of Independent States  in the framework of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization  and with its fellow BRIC countries Brazil  India and China — will continue to bolster the mechanisms of regional interaction. These mechanisms facilitate a collective response to common threats  while mitigating the consequences of the crisis for our citizens and increasing the sustainability of our national economies.  Secondly  I want to touch on the issue of existing problems. Allow me to dwell on those that cannot be effectively addressed without the participation or outside the framework of the United Nations. The first task in this regard is to address the imbalance of existing mechanisms of global economic governance  the inadequacy of their rules of the game  and the chasm between the financial markets and the real economy. We need to make joint efforts to establish financial and economic models that will protect all of us from such turmoil in the future.  Virtually all countries have seen a drop in output and in the standards of living of millions of their   17 09-52228  citizens. The crisis has exacerbated social problems  painfully tested young people at the very start of their lives  and caused significant growth in unemployment in all countries. Russia is no exception in this.  A painful blow has been delivered to our plans to alleviate poverty. A real threat of disruption of the Millennium Development Goals has emerged. We must do our utmost to prevent such a development. Donor assistance to countries in need cannot be postponed until some other time. The tasks set out as a priority by the international community must absolutely be addressed. The arrangements adopted at the G-20 summits and the United Nations Conference on the World Financial and Economic Crisis and Its Impact on Development must be implemented — and they must be implemented within the deadlines that we ourselves set.  The second major task in this context is to address the issues of global energy security. Three years ago at the Saint Petersburg G-8 summit in Russia  the principles for a new legal framework for such cooperation were formulated. The goal is to harmonize the interests of all participants in the energy chain: suppliers  consumers and intermediaries or transiters. It was not so long ago that we solidified these principles  and we invite all States to engage in discussion on them. We believe that such discussions should be conducted with the active involvement of specialized multilateral institutions  including  of course  the agencies of the United Nations family.  The third task that Russia deems to be potentially critical is the comprehensive strengthening of the United Nations itself. The United Nations must adapt itself in a rational way to the new global realities. It should strengthen its influence while preserving its multinational nature and the integrity of the Charter’s key provisions. The most important component of the revitalization of the United Nations is reform of the Security Council. The time has come to speed up the search for a compromise formula for the Security Council’s expansion  and of course to increase its efficiency.  The third issue I want to touch on is disarmament. The process of multilateral disarmament under United Nations auspices is an extremely important task. There are grounds for hope since  as members are aware  a number of positive trends have emerged in overcoming the protracted crisis. The Conference on Disarmament in Geneva has adopted its programme of work. I should also like to mention the Russian-Chinese initiative to develop a treaty to prevent the deployment of weapons in outer space  as well as our current proposal to universalize the Russian-American Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-range and Shorter-range Missiles.  Russia will unswervingly follow the path of verifiable and irreversible reductions in nuclear weapons as an essential element of a new start in our relations with the United States. In Moscow in July this year  President Obama and I not only signed a relevant document  but also agreed on a mandate for further negotiations to elaborate a new  legally binding treaty. This treaty should replace the Treaty on the Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms  which expires in December.  Of special importance here is the relationship between strategic offensive and defensive arms. In my meeting with President Obama this morning  we discussed the recently announced adjustments to the United States’ planned development of a missile defence system. I should like to state in this highest of forums that we view this decision as a constructive step in the right direction  which has deservedly received numerous expressions of support from the international community. Russia is ready to engage in detailed discussions with the American side and to undertake relevant initiatives in this field in order to reach mutually acceptable agreement.  Without resolving such problems as missile defence and non-nuclear strategic offensive arms  it will be simply impossible to achieve real progress in the field of nuclear disarmament. I believe that the work on this new treaty will be fully consistent with relevant provisions of the joint document endorsed by the President of the United States and myself at our meeting in Moscow.  We believe that other nuclear States should join the disarmament efforts of Russia and the United States. There is no need to wait for further progress in the Russian-American disarmament process. We can begin forthwith to elaborate acceptable and practical arrangements that take into account the differences in the size of potentials. In that respect  we could draw on international experience in the twentieth century  for example the 1921-1922 Washington Conference on naval armaments  where participants agreed on the    09-52228 18  maximum size of their fleets without insisting on parity in absolute terms. If we take the same approach today  based on the current status of nuclear arsenals  we could send the rest of the world a sure signal that the unaccounted numbers will be added to the equation of strategic stability.  Pursuing nuclear disarmament  strengthening the nuclear non-proliferation regime and promoting the peaceful use of nuclear energy will be at the very heart of the 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). We cherish the hope that it will be successful.  The global nuclear security summit scheduled for April 2010 will provide a good opportunity for a more detailed discussion of these issues. We support that initiative. We have also agreed with the United States Administration on joint steps for further progress on such aspects of nuclear security as the prevention of nuclear terrorism  expanding access to the benefits of peaceful nuclear energy to all signatories implementing the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in good faith  and other decisions. We call for collective cooperation on these matters.  In order to reach a common understanding on such important issues  we must engage all nations  and influential international organizations in the aforementioned negotiation processes. The international community  it must be said  has at its disposal such tried and tested measures for enhancing regional and international security as nuclear-weapon-free zones. In particular  there is a very pressing need to establish a zone in the Middle East free of all types of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery. This is a long-standing issue  with respect to which a resolution was adopted at the 1995 NPT Review Conference.  Russia  as a member of the Quartet of international mediators on the Middle East settlement  has consistently supported efforts to strengthen the nuclear non-proliferation regime in the Middle East. Russia has made specific proposals within the framework of the NPT review process to seek mutually acceptable ways of implementing earlier decisions on this matter. All countries of the region need to take an active stance on this issue and demonstrate their willingness to achieve that end.  We also need to accelerate work towards a mechanism to ensure peace and security in North-East Asia. Russia has made proposals in this regard to the participants in the Six-Party Talks. In the present circumstances  this task is more urgent than ever.  The fourth topic I wish to address is that of regional conflicts and regional security. We intend to continue to participate in the search for effective options for settling regional conflicts. We are convinced that the use of force can only exacerbate such situations. That was demonstrated by the reckless attempt by the Georgian authorities last year to resolve the problems in their relations with South Ossetia by military means.  At that time  in August 2008  we came very close to a situation in which a local armed conflict had the potential to grow into a full-scale war. I am certain that this is clearly understood by everyone in this Hall today. In order to ensure that this should never recur  we need clear and effective mechanisms to implement the principle of the indivisibility of security. Without such a mechanism  we will not be able to move beyond the legacy of the past or overcome existing prejudices. I wish to stress that irresponsible regimes should not have any opportunity whatsoever to foment disputes among other countries.  The role and place of the modern nation in ensuring global security is a topic of the greatest relevance today. We have witnessed situations time and again in which problems emerging within the confines of an individual State have acquired a regional or even global character. The incompetence and  very often  ineffectiveness of national Government institutions can have consequences that are fraught with risks for several countries. The prevention of such an outcome is of course a very complex and sensitive issue  but one upon which we must deliberate together.  These issues were the focus of discussions at a recent conference held in Russia. The outcome was quite clear. What we require in the future is a smart foreign policy. The current global crisis is not limited to economics; it is also a crisis of ideas. It is the accumulation of a critical mass of outdated policies and development models.  Having developed the initiative to sign a new European security treaty  Russia has proposed taking a fresh approach to this problem and  above all  abandoning outdated policies. We all hope that the cold war has been left behind  but the world has not become more secure. What we need today are modern solutions and clear legal frameworks for implementing existing   19 09-52228  political commitments. We do not need declarations  appeals or demagogues; what we need are clear legal frameworks  including to enshrine the principle under international law that one must not seek to ensure one’s own security at the expense of the security of others.  Our initiative concerns the Euro-Atlantic space. However  its key provision on the indivisibility of security is a universal principle that is applicable to all regions of the world and is fully consistent with the letter and spirit of the United Nations Charter. The principle of the indivisibility of security should be an integral part of current international law.  Values are the last issue that I wish to mention from this rostrum. The protection of human rights and interests and the universal application of commonly recognized norms and principles in that area should be the basis for strengthening trust and stability in international relations. We are all united by values that are rooted in morality  religion  customs and traditions. I am talking about such fundamental concepts as the right to life  tolerance of dissent  responsibility towards one’s family  charity and compassion  which are the foundation both of daily life and of relations among States.  However  unfortunately  it is the reality that the world is witnessing growing nationalism and numerous manifestations of religious intolerance and hatred. That is why we believe that establishing a high-level group on interfaith dialogue under the Director-General of UNESCO is extremely valuable. It is particularly relevant on the eve of 2010  which the United Nations has declared International Year for the Rapprochement of Cultures.  To conclude  I cannot fail to mention  as I stand here  another topic that is very close to the heart of all citizens of our country and all peoples of the world. Next year  we are going to celebrate the sixty-fifth anniversary of the end of the Second World War. Russia put forward a proposal to adopt a relevant General Assembly resolution and to hold a special session to commemorate all victims of that war in May next year. We cannot allow its horrible lessons to be forgotten.  However  from time to time we see neo-fascist organizations raise their heads. Racial  national and ethnic crimes are being committed. Attempts are being made to whitewash Nazism  to deny the Holocaust and to review the decisions of the Nuremberg Tribunal. I am convinced that strong and joint resistance to manifestations of neo-Nazism and to attempts to revise the results of the Second World War enshrined in the United Nations Charter should remain a priority task of the Organization.  The creation of the United Nations was one of the principal achievements of the international community in the twentieth century. This Organization and its fruitful activities have become a symbol of the twentieth century  and there is simply no alternative to these activities. We have no right to forget that the United Nations possesses unique international legitimacy  and we all must preserve and strengthen this shared wealth of the peoples of the world. "
"149",6020,"RWA",64,2009,"This session of the General Assembly offers further opportunity to reflect on how best to reconcile what at times mistakenly appears to be irreconcilable: socio-economic development and a healthy environment. Leaders  experts and citizens the world over ask how we can grow our economies and spread prosperity to more of the world’s citizens  yet not degrade our oceans  rivers and the air we breathe?  But these are also times of extraordinary scientific  technological and business innovations that can help address those challenges  if we have the courage to put into proper perspective and indeed harmonize our national  regional and global priorities.    09-52320 10   History is replete with illustrations of how nations immersed in crises changed the underlying assumptions by which they acted  created new institutions and tools to solve problems and emerged from the process as stronger societies. While those innovations are always different  the challenges to surmount the crises are always the same: forging a shared vision  increasing the social capital required to enhance predictability  having trustful relations between peoples  being receptive to doing things in new ways and adopting an explicit moral purpose in order to achieve common goals.  We have an exceptional opportunity to simultaneously address our environmental challenges  improve our economies and reform our global multilateral institutions for better global governance. For example  the Group of Twenty (G-20) is now playing a crucial role in restoring global economic stability. But should we not even broaden the base to include many nations that are most vulnerable to the decisions of the few? All nations should be part of those important discussions and decisions  because they have valuable contributions to make. This is the time to embrace true multilateralism.   We in developing nations appreciate the corrective measures taken by the G-20 and the Group of Eight to accelerate global economic recovery. But it is evident that most of their proposals fall short of the concrete steps needed to address challenges that are specific to low-income countries.  Multilateralism has always been the key tenet in forging a fairer international community based on equitable global governance. The United Nations itself is based on that very sound and tested principle  and that should be the practice. The rise of worldwide networks of trade  industry  prosperity and social values  together with the creation of multilateral institutions to guide and harmonize those processes  has no doubt contributed to a fairer and improved global decision-making system. That is what needs to be rendered more inclusive.  Improving global governance has also to address international justice. International justice should be fair to all — rich and poor  strong or weak. We are all pleased to note that at its sixty-third session the General Assembly undertook to examine comprehensively the issue of universal jurisdiction. We look forward to the resolutions on that matter during the Assembly’s current session.   It is also fitting that we recognize the recent creation of a single entity within the United Nations to advance the work on women’s rights and gender equality. Rwanda has always made that one of its priorities and has achieved good results.   With regard to socio-economic challenges in our East African Community region  we are making progress in key areas. For instance  we are preparing to inaugurate  in January 2010  the East African Common Market to facilitate greater trade  investment and the free movement of almost 130 million people. We believe that there is no better strategy for mitigating economic difficulties than building larger regional markets that bring about improved productivity  which increases purchasing power and  in turn  strengthens our societies.  With regard to the global environmental challenge  this session of the General Assembly provides an important platform for preparing for the Copenhagen climate change summit. Every nation should have co-equal status and be considered a concerned nation at the forthcoming summit. That implies that each nation has both rights and obligations and should be open to burden-sharing according to its ability. This is the time to address in a timely fashion such key issues as how much the industrialized countries are to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases  how much the developing countries are to limit the growth of their emissions  and how to finance and support strategies to conserve energy  mitigate risk and build green technologies that counteract the impact of climate change in the developing world.  We in Rwanda have been making a modest but proportionate contribution by  among other things  hosting African preparatory meetings for the Copenhagen summit in order to encourage a strong and essential African voice at that critical meeting. We have also been actively implementing national environmental policies for reforestation  terracing and the rehabilitation of wetlands that supply lake and river systems in our country  to name a few areas in which we have had good results.  On the matter of peace and security  the world faces a number of regional threats. The Great Lakes region has its share of peace and security problems  but we continue to make significant progress in   11 09-52320  fundamentally addressing that question. The leaders of the region recognize that  most crucially  home-grown solutions  beginning with a joint regional effort  can bring about sustainable peace. It is in that context that  together with our colleagues and neighbours in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  we are dealing with the root cause of instability in our area  namely  the negative forces that have been a menace since 1994.  If history teaches us anything  it is that we cannot apply the same strategies to different problems and expect satisfactory outcomes all the time. We have to think differently on the fundamental questions  including the urgent imperatives of  first  strengthening the future of all nations by fostering economic growth and development while investing in the environment. That should be our moral purpose. Secondly  we must improve peace and stability in all regions by learning from  and supporting  legitimate regional actors. Finally  we must engage and embrace the majority world in terms of multilateralism in decision-making  trade and prosperity.   These should be our shared vision. Future generations will then know how leaders of nations in the year 2009  immersed in crises  focused on the most difficult challenges  including the global economic crisis  climate change and greater peace and security  and how they acted with resolve."
"150",6102,"SDN",64,2009,"It is my pleasure at the outset to convey the best wishes of the Government and people of the Sudan for successful deliberations in the sixty-fourth session of the General Assembly on its entire agenda. The agenda contains topics reflecting the challenges faced by the international community and the priorities we have to set  such as the development and welfare of our peoples  the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  the mitigation of economic and financial crises  containing the effects of climate change and maintaining international peace and security.  I am also pleased to extend warm congratulations to Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at this important session. We are confident  Sir  that your political skills and diplomatic expertise will help realize our ambitions to have an able  effective and transparent United Nations. We also wish to commend the dexterity and high competence with which your predecessor  Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann  conducted the proceedings of the previous session. We also wish to commend the Secretary-General for the efforts undertaken by the Secretariat to fulfil the role and responsibilities of the United Nations.  Millions throughout the world look forward to our deliberations in the wake of the suffocating crises through which the international community is passing. Traces of the crises are still lingering in the family of nations  especially in the developing countries  while the fruits of scientific and technological progress nourish the hope of better opportunities for a just and equitable world order.  While non-compliance with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and international law and its established rules  along with double standards  has made the world less safe  the economic and financial crises have exacerbated the challenges. The world is experiencing the worst and gravest economic and financial crisis since the Depression of the 1930s. The crisis is compounded by such numerous and intertwined problems as the food crisis and climate change along with their destructive effects on the developing countries and threats to their national priorities and to the gains they have made towards the achievement of the MDGs.  In its chairmanship of the Group of 77 and China  the Sudan has accorded special attention to the repercussions of this crisis on the developing countries. In those countries the crisis has given rise to poverty  hunger  unemployment and slackening of growth  if not economic downturn  and has adversely affected balances of trade and of payment. At the same time  the crisis has led to falls in commodity prices  sharp fluctuations in exchange rates  sudden diversions of    09-52598 30  capital flows and of foreign direct investment  falls in remittances and drops in tourism revenues. Concomitantly  the social sector has suffered greatly because of the erosion of social security networks that provide health  education and other services. That in turn has augmented infant and maternal mortality rates.  The Group of 77 and China is deeply concerned over this crisis and its impact on countries facing special challenges  foremost among which are African States  the least developed countries  small island States and countries emerging from conflict. The realities impose a moral duty on us — especially the industrial countries — to channel our collective response into a strong commitment to providing the required solutions. Those include direct funding  capacity-building  promoting sustainable development  addressing debt problems  eliminating obstacles to trade and investment and States meeting their international development pledges.  Comprehensive reform of the international financial and economic system and ensuring an enhanced role for the developing countries in decision-making processes in international financial institutions are of central significance. Major industrial countries cannot ignore the universal legitimacy of the collective voice of the world’s States here at the United Nations. In this connection  the open-ended working group of the General Assembly to follow up on the issues contained in the Outcome of the Conference on the World Economic and Financial Crisis and Its Impact on Development (resolution 63/303  annex)  held in New York in June 2009  must discharge its work and mandate expeditiously.  By the same token  we hope that endeavours to deal with climate change in the course of the conference to be held in Copenhagen in December of this year will be crowned with success. The developing countries — which were by no means responsible for climate change and global warming — urge industrialized countries  on the basis of their historic responsibility  to address the root causes of climate change by providing new and additional predictable financial resources  to help build capacities  to transfer  entrench and develop technology and to fulfil relevant obligations and pledges with a view to attaining sustainable economic growth that satisfies the legitimate priorities and needs of the developing countries. As Chair of the Group of 77 and China  my country will spare no effort in furthering those demands.  The absence of democracy in international relations  as exemplified by the present form and composition of the Security Council  has become a major factor in diminishing the ability of the United Nations to respond to the structural and substantive challenges and changes in the international community. That has been exacerbated by unilateral sanctions that hinder international trade and investment and violate the Charter of the United Nations and the rules of international law.   The United Nations rostrum is being used by some to serve narrow interests such that the concept of human rights has become a tool for ceaseless politicization and score settling. In the same vein  the often misused concept of terrorism has led to the victim being equated with the aggressor  as is currently evident in the plight of the Palestinian people  who are still chafing under the yoke of occupation. As a result  the Palestinian question has remained unsolved  which has gravely compromised the reputation and credibility of the United Nations.  It is thus clear that for the United Nations to effectively serve a changing world  it has to effect an all-out change in its working methods and approaches so that it will truly express the voice of all nations. Consequently  my country  like all other developing nations  supports the call to reactivate the role of the General Assembly and to reform the Security Council  based on the well-known African position on this matter.  This session is of special importance to my country for it comes at a time when we are putting an end to what has been called the longest civil war in Africa by concluding the Comprehensive Peace Agreement. The Agreement adopts a system making citizenship a basis for rights and duties  and espousing diversity as a source of unity and brotherhood built on the rule of law  good governance  respect for freedoms and human rights  as well as fair and democratic power-sharing.  Additionally  the Agreement establishes the principles of wealth sharing  in line with the norms of equity and equality. The implementation of the Agreement has proceeded with the completion of the formation of relevant mechanisms and institutions  along with the full commitment by the two parties to   31 09-52598  the Agreement to the sound treatment of the question of entitlements as reflected in the handling of the question of Abyei.  We note here the fact that donors have not fulfilled the development resources and pledges they took upon themselves in support of the Agreement has adversely affected its implementation  particularly in the spheres of development  rehabilitation and reintegration of former combatants in society. We therefore urge the fulfilment of all pledges so as to foster peace and stability  as well as the reconstruction of the country after the ravages of years of war  so that peace can be meaningful.  After conducting a population census — the accuracy and credibility of which were testified to by numerous international and regional institutions  including the United Nations — and in conformity with the Agreement  we are about to hold general legislative and executive elections. We assert our resolve and determination to hold them in April 2010  while we continue to strengthen efforts aimed at political reform  which is indispensable for founding a durable peace. We invite the international community  including the United Nations  to support the holding of elections in word and deed.  Despite all the positive developments in the peace process  we note with profound concern the recent armed tribal conflicts in southern Sudan. Those conflicts threaten not only the stability of the Sudan and the South but also the stability of the whole region. We would like to recall here that  in accordance with the Agreement  the responsibility for the maintenance of peace in the South lies with the Government of Southern Sudan. Therefore  it is everybody’s duty to urge and encourage the Government of Southern Sudan to discharge its duty for the sake of its citizens’ security and prosperity.  Our people have recognized that peace will not be complete unless it extends to our people in Darfur. The signing of the Darfur Peace Agreement in Abuja under the gracious aegis of the African Union affirmed the Government’s serious commitment to resolving the problem of Darfur peacefully.  While we were earnestly attempting to implement that Agreement  certain international parties did not fulfil their pledges and obligations in strict application of the Agreement  such as by applying unwarranted pressure on the wrong side. Instead of pressuring the parties that shied away from the peace option  pressure was put on the Abuja signatories themselves. That hampered peace endeavours and led to the protraction of the conflict.  Yet  thanks to the steadfast maintenance of the Agreement by our Government and people and our relentless efforts to achieve peace  we are now seeing positive and far-reaching developments leading towards lasting peace in Darfur  thanks also to the complete commitment shown by the National Unity Government and its close cooperation with the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur through the Tripartite Mechanism.  That policy has led to far-reaching improvements in the humanitarian situation in Darfur  as recognized and attested to by United Nations reports. That is further supported by our scrupulous commitment to the humanitarian agreement signed last April with the United States Special Envoy to the Sudan. We reiterate our commitment to close cooperation with the United Nations and with national and international organizations with a view to enhancing and developing that policy in a manner that prevents any humanitarian disaster or even food gaps in the future.  In this connection  it is imperative to note the massive return of internally displaced persons (IDPs) to their villages  which makes it incumbent on the Government  the Sudanese people and the international community to seize this opportunity to foster this trend  as it is the real test of peace.  We renew our commitment and preparedness to work expeditiously and at all times to ensure the success of the forthcoming negotiations in Doha within the framework of the Afro-Arab initiative and the efforts of the Joint Mediator  in accordance with the decision taken by the initiatives committee in its meeting held at the margins of this session.  We welcome the declaration made by the American President  Barack Obama  before the General Assembly  on his country’s readiness to help find solutions to the problems of Darfur. Noting the positive tone in the statements voiced by the American President towards developing countries in general  we hope that his words will be translated into action and sincere effort in order to correct the misguided policies and positions of the previous American Administration  which have compromised bilateral relations and aggravated the region’s problems. This  undoubtedly     09-52598 32  requires  first and foremost  lifting the unilateral sanctions and removing the name of the Sudan from the United States’ list of terrorist States.  We renew our appeal to the armed groups to muster the will for a solution and for involvement in the peace process  so that the interests of the Sudanese people are put first and foremost. The people of the Sudan are more than capable of solving their own problems. My country has repeatedly declared its commitment to a unilateral ceasefire as an initiative for confidence-building and bringing about successful negotiations  and we hope that armed factions will respond positively so that a permanently monitored ceasefire can be reached.  The international community  which has  in the past  promised to take stringent measures against those who refused to take part in the peace talks or impede them  has to do so in deed and not just in word. The question of development  recovery  rehabilitation and reconstruction should be given special attention  as called for in Security Council resolution 1769 (2007). There should be a transition from providing emergency humanitarian assistance to supporting development  in order to facilitate the return and settlement of IDPs and refugees.  From this rostrum  I wish to assert my country’s keen interest in having constructive relations with all its neighbours and its full readiness for complete cooperation with them  with a view to extinguishing all regional hot beds of tension. In this regard  I would like to stress our preparedness and willingness to normalize relations with Chad  in conformity with all agreements and instruments signed with them and we hope they will demonstrate the same determination and readiness.  At a time when the Government of National Unity had made remarkable progress in the implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement and when the Sudan had started a new phase towards the achievement of political reform and transformation  peaceful devolution of authority  progress towards ending disputes and infighting and towards the achievement of inclusive development for our people  the President of the Republic himself  who is the chief guarantor of the Sudan’s sovereignty  was targeted by so-called international justice in a futile attempt to undermine stability and development. The Sudanese rejected this  as did the international community  including regional and international organizations.  We emphasize that the realization of security and stability in Darfur requires speedy correction of those developments and a renewed commitment to the peace process and the avoidance of all that may have a negative impact on peace in the Sudan and the African continent.  Between the signing of the United Nations Charter in the middle of the last century and the momentous developments and profound challenges currently experienced by the world  much water has flown under the bridge of international relations  which makes annual General Assembly sessions serious opportunities for introspection and for gleaning lessons.  Let us renew our resolve to foster multilateral action  for which this Organization stands. Let our sixty-fourth session be a defining point towards achieving our collective aspirations for a world where the values of fraternity and common destiny prevail."
"151",6147,"SEN",64,2009,"We are meeting once again  but this time at a moment when humankind is facing many problems  each as difficult as the others  as if they had been planned to coincide: the agriculture crisis  the financial and economic crisis  environmental peril and tenacious  deadly diseases. Be that as it may  we are destined to prevail. There is simply no other option. We must and we can succeed. The numerous deliberations about these problems at all levels illustrate our increasing awareness of the dangers to us and succeeding generations.  Believing fundamentally as I do in the genius of humankind and its capacity for imagination and creativity in extricating itself from the most difficult situations  I am both optimistic and aware of the price that will have to be paid. This is what we are called on to do here and elsewhere. The only question is how to coordinate the numerous elements required to expedite the rescue mission.  Before going any further  however  I should like warmly to congratulate Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki  who has been charged with guiding the work of this sixty-fourth session of the General Assembly. I have known Mr. Treki for a long time  and Senegal is delighted by his election and expresses its confidence in his human and professional qualities  which will bolster the success of his mission.   I also pay tribute to Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann  President of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session  for his contributions to the effort to revitalize the Assembly. His commitment and dynamism are well known. I have admired his intelligence  his lively wit and the sensitivity he shows in his relations with others. To Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon  Senegal reiterates its support for his delicate task in the face of the many and urgent issues facing the Organization.  This sixty-fourth session of the General Assembly has begun at a time of multifaceted turmoil. The economic and financial crisis  the scale of which has surprised many observers  reveals above all the deadlock in contemporary economic theory. In highlighting the inadequacy of our analytical and predictive abilities  it calls for a broader sense of shared responsibility both for the management of its immediate effects and for the search for long-term responses. In seeking solutions  let us be careful not to make the mistake of falling back on received wisdom and ready-made answers. Be it in the sphere of the environment  political and economic governance or development  the world must find a new way of thinking and acting  and thereby address the need to change our outlook.  Having myself argued  often strongly  for the full participation of Africa in the conversation on world governance  I welcome the progressively expanded cooperative framework of the Group of Eight (G-8) and the Group of 20 (G-20). I only regret that my proposal to establish a shadow G-20  made up of the   41 09-52425  world’s greatest experts but open to all those who bring new ideas  has not yet been put into practice.  The President returned to the Chair.  Clearly  the world’s heads of State  elected on the basis of political criteria  cannot miraculously transform themselves into universal polymaths. They must hold to their political and even strategic role  and rely on the superior knowledge of experts. It is through dialogue open to all that we will be able to grasp the diversity of our respective situations and apply real-world answers to real-world problems. It is therefore fitting that the theme of this sixty-fourth session should be “Effective responses to global crises: strengthening multilateralism and dialogue among civilizations for international peace  security and development”.  The current challenges  both complex and global in nature  call strongly for innovative and concerted solutions if we are to succeed. That is especially true for problems of agriculture and food security. If we are to achieve on schedule Millennium Development Goal 1  to halve by 2015 the number of people suffering from hunger  we must put into practice a different approach to international cooperation  one based on support for agriculture instead of food assistance  which should be used only as an emergency response to exceptional circumstances.   The development of agriculture to promote sustainable food security in Africa necessarily involves water management  the availability of equipment  producers’ access to inputs and a sound organization of chains of production  storage  processing and sales of agricultural products. That is why Senegal hopes that these essential questions — and others  such as the regulation of agricultural markets and scientific research to increase productivity — will take a prominent place on the agenda of the Summit of the World’s Regions on Food Security  to be held in January 2010 in Dakar  and of the Global Partnership for Agriculture and Food Security proposed by the G-8.  Once the right conditions are in place  there is no reason why Africa should not be able to ensure its own food security. Better yet  its enormous land and water resources predispose the continent to become the world’s breadbasket. To that end  however  we must avoid the vicious trap of ceding land to foreigners bearing millions of dollars. The G-8 quite rightly expressed its concern on this subject at its most recent summit in Italy. According to recent estimates  between 15 and 20 million hectares have changed hands over the past three years  primarily in Africa. We Africans should make it our vocation to become farmers tilling our own land rather than being agricultural labourers working for capital-rich foreign planters.  For its part  Senegal  as I have often said  cannot accept such a course  which would without doubt empty our countryside of newly impoverished millions  who would swell our slums and the ranks of those ripe for illegal emigration. On the other hand  if we exploit our mutually complementary circumstances  we of the North and the South can promote a win-win partnership in which investors and local communities join to develop African land without dispossession. Senegal has succeeded  in record time  in responding positively to the food crisis. For the second year in a row  our home-grown agricultural campaign for food and abundance  known as GOANA  has rewarded us with excellent results.  We intend to strengthen this food self-sufficiency option with the unionization of rural producers  on the model of Québec. To this end  we are currently setting up a green bank for farmers  fishers and livestock farmers  which will support financing of these sectors. This is a bold innovation  a green revolution that we want very much to see succeed.  At the global level  I believe that  beyond its adverse impacts  the current crisis has a silver lining insofar as it stimulates creativity  initiative and a fighting spirit. If the Secretary-General had not launched his emotional appeal at World Food Day in Rome two years ago  I might not have felt a challenge so great as to demand the invention of GOANA. And because the fate of our people is at stake  it is our primary responsibility to establish on our own the conditions necessary for a brighter future.  Internal efforts will continue to be futile without a healthy global environment rid of the speculative practices of the virtual economy and unjust asymmetric programmes  such as subsidies and other inequitable practices. In this context  non-oil-producing African countries continue to feel the full brunt of the increase in oil prices resulting from speculative practices that we cannot mitigate because they are controlled by the oil oligarchy. Economies such as ours  which had hitherto posted average growth rates of 5 per cent  have been brutally weakened by imported inflation.    09-52425 42   For that reason  Senegal supports and encourages the dialogue between producers and consumers initiated by the International Energy Forum to improve transparency in the oil market and take effective measures against speculative practices that devastate the economies of importing States.  In implementing the “Wade formula”  I proposed a fund to fight poverty funded by voluntary contributions from African oil-producing States and oil companies working in Africa  based on the principle of shared social responsibility. The fund could be managed collectively or entrusted to the World Bank. Similarly  I welcome the extension of the Exogenous Shocks Facility to countries benefiting from the Policy Support Instrument.  The summit meeting on climate change confirmed a broadly shared conclusion. If we do not change our methods of production and consumption  the future of mankind itself will be in peril. We must admit that we have not taken sufficient action to reverse these negative trends. Nature subjects us daily to the adverse consequences of our own attacks against it in different ways  including floods  droughts  desertification and coastal erosion. These upheavals foreshadow even more devastating phenomena. International consensus is therefore urgently needed to save the planet. In order to survive  each of us must strive to behave more respectfully towards the environment and to create a world with fewer greenhouse gas emissions. According to the hopeful statement of the Secretary-General  we now find ourselves on the threshold of a new era — that of the green economy. Let us have the courage to cross the threshold for ourselves and for succeeding generations.  Africa for its part wishes to assume its share of responsibility in this necessary environmental rebirth. That is the essence of the Great Green Wall project that runs from Dakar to Djibouti. Shared by all countries it runs through  the Great Green Wall is 7 000 kilometres long and 15 kilometres wide  and Senegal has the responsibility of coordinating it on behalf of the African Union.   With the assistance of experts from all over the world  we have selected plants adapted to the fairly arid conditions prevailing in the Sahelian-Saharan zone. At the same time  we have decided to build water-collection basins along the entire length of the Great Green Wall  based on the model that we have implemented in Senegal with some 250 basins. Every African State involved in the construction of the Great Green Wall organizes its implementation at the local level through a national agency. At the continental level  national agencies are coordinated by a pan-African Great Green Wall agency under the auspices of the African Union.  I cherish the hope that the United Nations will become involved in this project  which contributes to protecting the global environment  by mobilizing what might be called anti-desert soldiers along the lines of peacekeeping troops. Here  I pay tribute to the participation of Ivorian boys and girls who  although not directly impacted by desertification — Côte d’Ivoire being a country of forests — spontaneously participated in building the Senegalese section of the Great Green Wall in Senegal. They worked voluntarily  side by side with their comrades from Senegal. These young people  transcending the artificial borders created by colonization  are using self-determination to take ownership of the struggle for Africa’s future. This experience could serve as a prelude to the creation of a broad movement of “youth without borders” that unites young Africans from throughout the continent. They could be the heralds of various causes  such as the fight against HIV/AIDS  early marriage and female circumcision  as they in Senegal.  While we await foreign assistance  Senegal has already built nearly 527 kilometres of the Great Green Wall. The project is also under way in Mali  and Chad will follow in the near future.  Through the progressive restoration of the Saharan ecosystem  the Great Green Wall will contribute through greenhouse gas sequestration to the global fight against global warming. I thank the European Union for its pledged support  and I welcome in particular President Sarkozy’s initiative to deploy to this front — the only worthy front — soldiers to plant trees and build water-collection basins. I cherish the hope that this initiative will serve to inspire other States with the necessary human and material resources to support the Great Green Wall.  Given the severity of the situation  the environmental threat  in my opinion  should be considered a threat to international peace and security. If it were  we might consider allocating new international missions to national armies. In the manner of peacekeeping operations  Senegal proposes   43 09-52425  the creation of a mechanism to save and restore the environment based on the voluntary commitment of armies through modalities to be determined.  In the framework of civilian and military activities  countries wishing to do so could mobilize contingents for specific periods to assist in implementing major environmental projects  such as the Great Green Wall  or what is referred to in Senegal as the Atlantic wall against coastal erosion.  In Senegal  we are currently creating along our coastline a concrete wall 3 to 4 metres deep and 40 centimetres wide built on an impermeable foundation to stop the maritime erosion that threatens many African countries. Its effectiveness is guaranteed. The only problem is the cost — $1.5 million per kilometre. From Casablanca to Cotonou  representing some 5 000 kilometres of vulnerable coastline  the overall cost would be $7.5 billion. Compared to expenditures often seen at the global level  it certainly is not much. Moreover  if mankind were to stop building lethal weapons for only three months and allocate the money thus saved to building the Atlantic wall  the threat to that part of Africa would be permanently removed.   For 16 years now  Security Council reform has been an important item on our agenda. It is a paradox that an Organization  universal in its mission  should remain deadlocked 64 years after its creation by the elitist nature of its principal body. The leader Al-Qadhafi summarized our position on that issue (see ). As Africa is the only continent not represented among the permanent members  despite the fact that it’s the focus of 70 per cent of the Council’s work  that historic injustice must be corrected by granting the continent here and now  outside the context of overall reform  one seat with the right of veto that could be held by the Chairman-in-Office of the African Union. Let us ensure that this session is the one at which we finally solve the issue of Security Council reform so that we can focus our efforts on other important issues.   Those important issues still unfortunately include the tragic situation in the Middle East. While it recognizes the Israeli people’s right to live in peace within secure and internationally recognized borders  Senegal resolutely supports the just and legitimate claim of the Palestinian people to a viable  free and independent State. That claim is morally consonant with the right of peoples to self-determination.   However  in general  Senegal rejects violence in all its forms  whatever its origin. Israel’s pursuit of illegal activities on Palestinian territory is counterproductive. The settlement  expropriation and lockdown of the territories are a serious obstacle to the negotiations process and delay the prospects of an era of peace for all peoples of the subregion. Senegal supports the vision of two States  Israeli and Palestinian  as recalled here yesterday by President Barack Obama (see ).  Turning to the situation in Africa  Senegal welcomes the considerable progress made in the peaceful settlement of disputes and in the integration process towards establishing the United States of Africa. The accomplishment of African unity is the only viable answer to the challenges of globalization  the creation of large groupings and the redefinition of the rules of governance. It is also an essential condition for the establishment of lasting peace and stability on the continent.  Senegal continues to contribute to the settlement of disputes in Africa on the basis of that ideal of peace. I therefore welcome the normalization of the situation in our sister Republic of Mauritania following the Dakar Accord of June 2009. We should remember that the Accord was concluded with the support of the International Contact Group throughout the negotiation process. I reiterate my congratulations and my appreciation to all.  In the sister Republic of Guinea-Bissau  I welcome the gradual return to stability after the presidential elections  recognized and acknowledged by all as free and transparent. As a neighbour  Senegal reiterates its call for the convening of a donor conference in support of the courageous stabilization and development efforts of the people of Guinea-Bissau  through their new authorities.  On the other hand  the situation in the Republic of Guinea seems to me of greater concern. That country merits our full attention because it could fall into violence at any time. Mrs. Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf  President of Liberia  and I  in our capacity as goodwill neighbours  were in Conakry only two weeks ago. I reported back to the African Union  stressing the need for an ongoing presence in the field and for a dialogue with all stakeholders  including the army. In my view     09-52425 44  that is the only way to help restore the constitutional order in Guinea.  The ideal of peace  the primary raison d’être of our Organization  remains seriously threatened by extremism of all stripes  fuelled and perpetuated by ignorance  mistrust and the manipulation of religion. The need for dialogue between cultures and civilizations is all the more urgent on that account. The challenge today  in particular for the three revealed religions that share the same God  is to build on that common monotheistic pedestal a bridge of brotherhood that brings us closer and teaches us to live together again by sharing our common values and with respect for our differences.  As Chairman-in-Office of the Organization of the Islamic Conference  I reiterate once again the dedication of the Islamic ummah to dialogue for the mutual understanding and peaceful coexistence of peoples because Islam  in letter and spirit  is a religion of the happy medium and of peace that teaches  in all things  knowledge  moderation  reasonableness and respect for the freedom of worship.  Let us all agree to strive to learn to better understand each other  overcome mistrust and fight the obscurantist ideas that give rise to tensions and confrontation. A world living in peace in the twenty-first century will be one in which all peoples enjoy an equally dignified existence.  In that spirit  Senegal will host the Third World Festival of Negro Arts from 1 to 15 December 2010. That artistic and intellectual event  with Brazil as guest of honour  will provide the opportunity for Africa and its diaspora to celebrate the values of culture and civilization of the black world. For us  that is a way to fight the prejudices that still haunt some malicious minds and fuel the re-emergence of revisionist ideas.  Africa is ready to meet the challenges of the twenty-first century in a spirit of openness and dialogue with all peoples for a world of peace and human brotherhood."
"152",6194,"SGP",64,2009,"When we met here last year  financial institutions such as Lehman Brothers and American International Group (AIG) were falling like tenpins. For weeks  credit froze as perceptions of risk shot up. The global financial system went into seizure. National Governments took emergency measures to rescue banks and keep credit lines open. The United States Treasury and the United States Federal Reserve  in particular  reacted with extraordinary boldness. For a period of time  it seemed as if everyone was flying blind.  After a year  the situation no longer looks as bleak today. In fact  after a sharp contraction of the advanced economies in the first half of this year  there are signs of a recovery. Some of the leading indicators are flashing positive again and the next two quarters will probably register good growth globally. Whether this growth can be sustained is  however  a different question.   41 09-52598   It would be a mistake to think that the global economic crisis will soon be over. The crisis came about because of excesses and imbalances which have to be put right. Looking back  we know that the excesses were the result of inadequate regulation of banks and quasi-banking institutions. Over the years  clever minds turned non-banks into de facto ones which were not regulated as conventional banks. This unregulated financial sector grew to dwarf the regulated sector.  To forestall collapse when the bubble burst  Governments and regulators stepped in taking over financial institutions  guaranteeing liabilities  increasing public spending and pumping liquidity into the economy. These are emergency measures which are needed to get the global economy through a critical phase. They have stabilized the financial sector and prevented the real economy from being too badly affected.  However  as when steroids are administered to reduce inflammation  there is a price to be paid for this temporary relief. First  the expectation that Governments will step in when things go badly wrong creates a huge moral hazard. Once Governments set a bottom limit to the consequences of risk-taking  more risks will be taken in the future.  Secondly  the huge increase in global liquidity has slowed down or reversed the fall in inflated asset prices. Worldwide stock markets have benefited from easy money. In Asia  property markets are booming again even though the real economy is still struggling. Withdrawing liquidity without destabilizing economies and asset markets in the coming months and years will be a tricky business.  And thirdly  the emergency measures which have been taken reduce the need for painful restructuring. Yet without major restructuring of regulatory systems and businesses  the imbalances which created the conditions for the crisis in the first place can only get worse.  While excesses in the financial sector were the trigger of the crisis  the deeper underlying cause was the global imbalance between producers and consumers and between saving and consumption. For too long  the world depended on the United States consumers keeping global demand high and on lending those consumers the money to keep the game going. To correct this imbalance  Asians have to consume more and save less as a proportion of income  while Americans have to consume less and save more. Otherwise  a global Keynesian paradox of thrift will cause the global economy to operate below capacity.  Rebalancing the global economy is  however  not a simple matter at all  and is not only about economics: it is also deeply political. The rise of Asia is altering the global power structure. Nothing expresses this more than the complex relationship that now ties the United States and China together. China  with its reserves of over $2 trillion  is heavily invested in the United States dollar  making it a major stakeholder in the United States economy. Without continuing market confidence in the United States dollar  not just the United States economy  but the entire global economy will be put at risk.  Looking ahead  however  it is not going to be a bipolar world but a multi-polar world. Europe and Japan will remain heavyweights. India  Russia  Brazil and others will become more significant players. A multi-polar world means a messier world with a diversity of political systems  values and worldviews. Non-State actors like civil society organizations must increasingly be engaged. At the same time  we are all members of the same human family sharing the same planet. Looking ahead  we will need more effective global governance across a wide range of issues from protection of human rights and international financial regulation to efforts to combat pandemics  climate change and terrorism.  The greatest challenge confronting us today is that of ensuring effective global governance. We do not want a global Government but we do need better coordination  cooperation and enforcement in many areas. The reform of the United Nations  including the United Nations Security Council  is going to take time. Incremental rather than dramatic change is a more practical approach.  In terms of world trade  the World Trade Organization  while far from perfect  can still function well with effective political leadership. Once that leadership is supplied  the Doha Round of negotiations can be concluded within the next few years. We are fortunate to have in Pascal Lamy a strong Director-General at the helm. But this is a dangerous period because domestic politics in many countries favour greater protectionism. At all regional and international    09-52598 42  forums  we must take a clear collective stand against protectionism.  Climate change is a long-term challenge for humanity which needs to be addressed with some urgency. While we cannot be sure how much increased carbon dioxide emissions will affect the global climate in the coming decades and centuries  it would be irresponsible for us in this generation not to start acting now. The increased weather volatility we have been experiencing in recent years could be a warning of longer-term trends already under way. An international agreement on climate change which aligns our interests and efforts is absolutely necessary to preserve this planet for future generations.  For that reason  we must redouble efforts to conclude negotiations for an international agreement at the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference at the end of this year. It is good that caring for the environment is increasingly becoming a moral norm in the world  especially among the young. We must not fail them. The strong political commitment expressed by many leaders at the Summit on Climate Change  chaired by the Secretary-General himself here last week  gives us reason for hope.  The present economic crisis is a major challenge to global governance. In November last year  then United States President George W. Bush convened the first summit of the Group of 20 (G-20). The second meeting of leaders was held in London in April and the third has just concluded in Pittsburgh under President Barack Obama’s chairmanship. The G-20 has now been designated the premier forum for international economic cooperation  replacing the Group of Eight (G-8).  This G-20 process and the swift  decisive actions that it brought about have helped avert an economic depression in the last year. The emergency measures taken by various Governments in response to the financial tsunami have bought us precious time to restructure and rebalance the global economy. In Pittsburgh  the G-20 leaders acknowledged that a sense of normalcy should not lead to complacency. We welcome their pledge to adopt policies needed for strong  sustained and balanced growth. If the biggest economies do not persist in that effort — and persisting means pain for domestic constituencies in many countries — the respite we are now enjoying will lead to an even bigger crisis  this time possibly involving foreign exchange markets as well.  In the coming months and years  it is important for the G-20 process to develop greater legitimacy  especially as it begins to deal with a broader set of issues. That the establishment of the G-20 leaders meeting was not blessed by the United Nations or other existing international organizations should not hold us back from giving it full support. Although the G-20 process is not ideal  it is the most important driver of change that we have right now.   The United Nations itself is too intricate and not structured to deal with issues such as a major financial crisis. The old G-8 lacked representation  and the G-8 Plus was not acceptable because it put the additional participants at a disadvantage. As for the International Monetary Fund  it was never designed to tackle a crisis of such scale. In any case  the Bretton Woods institutions themselves need reform  which indeed is a major subject on the G-20 agenda.  For the G-20 process to be effective and legitimate  however  it is not enough for leaders to confer and make general exhortations. Ministers and experts must also meet and go into details. They should not be confined to the same G-20 countries every time. We need variable geometry in membership. For different subjects  there could be different groups of participants  including both G-20 and non-G-20 countries. The views of small States  which comprise the majority of Members of the United Nations  must not be ignored. The meetings should be transparent. There must be wide consultations so that those not included in specific meetings can still table their views. Depending on the subject  those consultations can take place at the United Nations or at one of the other international organizations.  Mindful of the need to widen participation  British Prime Minister Gordon Brown invited regional representatives  such as the Chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)  the Chair of the New Partnership for Africa’s Development and the Chairperson of the African Union Commission  to the G-20 leaders meeting in London in April 2009. President Obama followed this precedent in Pittsburgh. We in ASEAN certainly hope that the inclusion of the ASEAN Chair will become the norm at future G-20 leaders meetings. It is right that the United Nations   43 09-52598  Secretary-General was included from the very beginning.  A balance has to be struck between effectiveness and inclusiveness. If a meeting is too big  it becomes unwieldy and unworkable. If too small  it lacks representation and legitimacy. As most Members of the United Nations are not in the G-20  it is important for us to have a say on the role the G-20 should play as an agent of change in global governance. While we should support the G-20 process  we should do so in a way that ensures that our own interests as smaller States are taken into account.  A great power shift is taking place in the world. The formal establishment of the G-20 as a new international institution last week marks a momentous new beginning. History shows that power shifts never occur smoothly. Without a good system of global governance  we can be sure that the power shift in this century will also be a troubled one. Putting that system in place requires the collective effort of all of us. We should not be lulled by the temporary easing of the global economic crisis into thinking that the worst is behind us and that we can return to our old ways."
"153",6227,"SLB",64,2009,"I bring warm greetings to the Assembly from the happy isles and convey my Government and people’s profound congratulations to Mr. Treki on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. We are confident that  under his leadership  we will harvest the opportunities the global agenda has to offer.  My delegation further takes this opportunity to commend his predecessor  Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann. He indeed provided exemplary leadership and inspired us to realize our unique collective strength. Throughout his tenure in office  he kept the most vulnerable people at the front  centre and back of all of our engagements. We wish him God’s blessing in his future endeavours.  The global financial and economic crisis has presented immense challenges to the international community. Simply put  the effects of the crisis are impacting all members of the United Nations family. Consequently  Solomon Islands’ economy has been hit by low commodity prices  declining revenues and widening budgetary deficits. My country has responded by freezing all Government recruitment and reducing national recurrent and development expenditures by 35 per cent. Between 2008 and 2009  our economic growth has taken a negative dive from 6 per cent to 1 per cent  which is affecting the delivery of services to our people.  The world has taken measures to address the systematic fragilities of the international financial system. To this end  Solomon Islands welcomes the outcome of the June 2009 Conference on the financial crisis  calling for greater cooperation by all  including the reform of the Bretton Woods institutions. We remain hopeful that the stimulus packages dished out reach the poorest of the poor  as many will be under stress for a long time to come.  Frequent natural disasters are threatening development across the world and climate change continues to affect the lives of our people  creating new pockets of poverty while continuing to increase as threats. Unless an ambitious outcome emanates from Copenhagen  we will find that we are fighting a losing battle. I join the call for urgent action  particularly for small island developing States and least developed countries. For us  climate change poses the most serious threat to our survival and viability  and undermines our efforts to achieve sustainable development.  Solomon Islands fully subscribes to the declaration issued this week by the Alliance of Small Islands Developing States. The benchmark for the negotiations must be founded on the vulnerability of the small island developing States and the least developed countries. Science tells us that the future of low-lying islands is uncertain unless deep and ambitious cuts to harmful greenhouse gas emissions are undertaken by Annex 1 countries at levels greater than 45 per cent of 1990 levels by 2020 and more than 95 per cent of 1990 levels by 2050. We call for the global average temperature to increase well below 1.5 degrees Celsius if we are to prevent the acidification of our oceans from threatening our very existence.  Deforestation and forest degradation contribute nearly 20 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions. Solomon Islands agrees that this should be one of the mitigating solutions for protecting the health of our environment. We further urge that this be considered as an outcome in Copenhagen. My country is currently carrying out an inventory of its forests and intends to participate in the carbon market. We also hope that multilateral financial mechanisms will become available to the most vulnerable States in ensuring that appropriate technology transfer for renewable energy receives the attention it deserves.  Solomon Islands is a peace-loving country and believes that we need to seriously seek a stable international system. This can be achieved by calling for global restraint on all military spending and making a firm commitment to begin holistic multilateral disarmament negotiations. This is an issue that has been stalled for years on end and continues to be    09-52470 50  weakly addressed through piecemeal multilateral arms agreements.  Solomon Islands emerged from a conflict situation 11 years ago. This year marks the sixth anniversary of our partnership with the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands  commonly referred to as RAMSI. Under the partnership  State institutions have been strengthened and political stability has allowed our Parliament to enact some 30 laws in less than 24 months. Public services are reaching out to the scattered populations on our hundreds of islands  indicating that change is happening.  This year  our relationship with RAMSI has progressed from one of assistance to one of partnership  providing for a framework of cooperation between the two parties  with clearly defined joint strategic goals  distinct roles and commitments  with the overall objective of creating a secure  stable and self-sustaining socio-economic and political system for all Solomon Islanders. The Foreign Relations Committee of our national Parliament has completed its review of the facilitation of the International Assistance Act and will submit its report to the national legislature in November. I take this moment to thank my Pacific neighbours for their continued support and contribution to the Regional Mission. It is our fervent hope that this partnership can increase its international visibility and interact more with the United Nations  as provided for under the relevant chapter of the Charter.  As part of our nation-building and healing process  Solomon Islands instituted its Truth and Reconciliation Commission in April. Officiating at the launch of the Commission was Nobel laureate and Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu of South Africa. The Commission allows Solomon Islands to revisit one of the darkest chapters of its history  and we do so with courage  perseverance and a desire to seek a just and permanent peace within our growing nation. To this end  we thank the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and all our partners for their support.  The time frame for the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) is fast drawing to a close. The Solomon Islands supports the proposal to convene a review summit next year  and hopes that the forthcoming gathering will reinvigorate our global partnership and enable it to realize the Millennium Development Goals within the given time frame. My country also welcomes the decision of the General Assembly (resolution 63/227) to convene the Fourth United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries in 2011. Similarly  we welcome the review of the Mauritius Strategy for the Further Implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States  scheduled for next year. Both review processes should strengthen the global partnerships and commitments undertaken within agreed international cooperative frameworks.  Eighty five per cent of the population of Solomon Islands resides in rural areas. Therefore  we have adopted a rural-focused development approach in our efforts to meet the MDGs. Solomon Islands is poised to make gains in achieving some of these goals through various partnerships. In this regard  I am pleased to acknowledge that  with the support of New Zealand and the Republic of China  the Solomon Islands is now offering free basic education for its children through the third form. Work has also begun on eliminating malaria  the number-one killer in the Solomon Islands  with the launch of the programme in one of our nine provinces. My Government thanks Australia for its support and contribution to that end. I also wish to thank the Republic of China  the European Union and other development partners for their contribution to the advancement of the Government’s rural development policy.  Human development remains a key ingredient of our fight against poverty. Solomon Islands opened a school of tourism this year. We have shifted resources towards developing our tourism industry in order to offset the projected revenue loss resulting from the reduced harvesting of our natural forests. The same policy also applies to the agriculture  fisheries and mining sectors.  South-South cooperation continues to invest in our people; it has guaranteed the education of 50 students studying in Cuba  and my country thanks Cuba for the gesture. Solomon Islands also thanks its Melanesian neighbour Papua New Guinea for its ongoing bilateral assistance by increasing our presence in Port Moresby and offering scholarships to our students studying in Papua New Guinea.  Global dynamics have changed since the United Nations was established 64 years ago. The membership   51 09-52470  then numbered only 51. Reform of the Security Council has eluded us for the past 15 years. We therefore need to increase the legitimacy of our Council and strengthen its role in preserving international peace. In this regard  my delegation was pleased to see the debate on Security Council reform progress into informal intergovernmental negotiations at the previous session of the General Assembly. We are equally pleased to note that three rounds of negotiations have occurred in the past eight months  signifying that the multilateral seed of reform of our institutions has been sowed. We need to ensure that it takes root at this session.  The relations of the Secretariat with Member States are important. The interaction of Solomon Islands with our Organization has grown and matured over time. Our Government is now finalizing the allocation of land to give the United Nations a permanent home in our capital. We hope that the Secretariat will reciprocate this gesture and seriously consider maintaining a fully fledged country presence in Solomon Islands. Comparatively speaking  despite the fact that my nation has one of the largest subregional country programmes  relations continue to be micromanaged from abroad. My delegation takes this opportunity once again to renew our call to upgrade the UNDP country presence in Solomon Islands from Deputy Resident Representative level to Resident Representative.  Here it would be remiss of me not to welcome UNDP’s new Administrator  Ms. Helen Clark. We wish her every success in her tenure in office and are confident that she will look at all issues with fresh eyes. Development is  after all  one of the highest callings of our Organization. Solomon Islands also encourages the Secretariat to ensure that its staff represents the diversity of its membership  in particular that of States that have yet to fulfil their quota.  Over the past couple of months  coastal States with continental shelves have made submissions to extend their respective territorial claims beyond their 200-mile exclusive economic zones. I am pleased to inform this Assembly that Solomon Islands has submitted a number of claims and looks forward to working with the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf.  While extending an exclusive economic zone is a sovereign decision  we are mindful of our global environmental responsibilities. Solomon Islands is one of the six countries of the Coral Triangle Initiative. Three months ago  leaders from the Philippines  Malaysia  Indonesia  Timor-Leste  Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands met in Indonesia and agreed to work collaboratively across political boundaries to conserve 75 per cent of the world’s coral species  40 per cent of the world’s reef fish species and 51 per cent of the world’s mangrove species. Our populations rely on our marine resources for survival and income. We hope to keep it that way for generations to come.  Good information and data are vital to allowing national and international systems to make informed decisions. In this connection  we would like to see United Nations support for our national statistics office for the collation of data in real time and its distribution to all decision makers.  To foster a vibrant economy  investment in infrastructure is needed. I am pleased to say that we have finally enacted a law that will open up our telecommunications industry to competition.  On the issue of human rights  Solomon Islands recognizes that all human rights are universal  indivisible  interrelated  interdependent and mutually reinforcing. All human rights must be treated in a fair and equal manner  on the same footing and with the same emphasis. That is one of the principles of the newly established Human Rights Council.  Solomon Islands continues to support the Council’s internationally agreed principles. Unfortunately  within the Third Committee issues of human rights continue to be heavily politicized  divisive and country-specific  in disregard of the universal principles of cooperation and dialogue. My delegation would like to see the universal periodic review be the reference point for assessing countries’ human rights situations.  Before I say anything about Taiwan’s cross-Strait relations  Solomon Islands conveys its sympathy and embraces the pain and suffering of all those impacted by typhoon Morakot. We also acknowledge the spirit and strength of the Government and people of the Republic of China in rising above that tragedy with resilience to rebuild their lives and recover from the natural catastrophe.  My country continues to follow cross-Strait developments with deep interest. A new era of relations    09-52470 52  is emerging between the Republic of China and the People’s Republic of China. Relations have been marked by an increased series of engagements. Direct flights  shipping  postal cooperation and exchanges on food safety  inter alia  have been initiated. This people-centred approach continues to build bridges of trust  tolerance and confidence. We wish this positive interaction every success.  Earlier this year  my delegation was encouraged to witness Taiwan’s admission as an observer to the World Health Assembly. We hope with all sincerity that similar overtures will be accorded to Taiwan by other specialized entities within the United Nations system.  On the question of the Middle East  my delegation associates itself with the statement of Finland’s former President  Nobel Peace Prize recipient Mr. Martti Ahtisaari  when he said “All conflicts can be settled  and there are no excuses for allowing them to become eternal”. To find a lasting and just peace in the region  the determination of all Members is required. For 62 years  the matter has been discussed within this Assembly. Solomon Islands believes that  in the right conditions  a politically negotiated two-State solution can be reached. We support all international efforts in finding a lasting and permanent solution.  In our effort to create a better world  dialogue and cooperation between religions and cultures are needed. Stereotypes created by a few must be overcome. Extremists thrive on mistrust  fear and suspicion and use them to their advantage. They must be isolated. My delegation acknowledges the initiative of Saudi Arabia to bring together leaders from the East and West in promoting a global culture of peace. This initiative presents a new beginning that we should all build upon.  We must all work towards stabilizing the international system  which means that those with power must not victimize the weak by interfering with the latter’s health and social needs  be it for ideological  political or security reasons. Unilateral and regional economic blockades and punitive action by States and intergovernmental institutions must and should be replaced with genuine cooperation and sincere dialogue. In this regard  we call on the entire international community to fully engage with Fiji. As its Melanesian neighbour  Solomon Islands continues to do so at all political levels.  In closing  in view of the many challenges we are confronting today  the words of Abraham Lincoln in 1862 still holds true:   “The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present."
"154",6273,"SLE",64,2009,"I feel highly honoured to address the Assembly once again. I would like to start by congratulating Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session and to assure him of my delegation’s support and cooperation as he performs the demanding task of presiding over our deliberations. Through him  I would also like to convey my sincere gratitude to His Excellency Monsignor Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann for the efficient and effective manner in which he conducted the previous session. In addition  my appreciation goes to the Secretary-General for his comprehensive account of the work of the Organization and his analysis of the challenges facing the global community.  The theme for this year’s session is apt and timely. It is only through dialogue among the various   09-52320 18  civilizations of the world represented in this deliberative body and the strengthening of the institutions and architecture responsible for promoting such dialogue that we can effectively meet the challenges posed by the current global crisis. Dialogue promotes understanding; understanding enhances cooperation; and cooperation gives vitality and legitimacy to the institutions and mechanisms that have been structured to meet our common challenges and goals.  Civilizations began as magnificent blueprints for meeting challenges that were specific to particular regions of the world  but advances in technology and communications have made problems no longer specific to particular regions. Climate change; the HIV/AIDS  tuberculosis and swine flu pandemics; the food and fuel crises  including the present global economic meltdown; terrorism; nuclear proliferation; and drug trafficking are all beyond the capacity of any of the world’s civilizations to tackle without international cooperation. While the major causes of those challenges may arise from particular regions  their impacts are global and affect the lives and fortunes of peoples of all civilizations. Dialogue among civilizations will create the synergies required to tackle the causes and impacts of the global crises.  My Government fully subscribes to and supports the promotion of dialogue  as well as the facilitation of mechanisms that will help to ameliorate the impact of the global crises. Among some population groups  that impact may be on the size of their bonuses; among others  it may be on whether they acquire a second car or not. But for the vast number of people — particularly in Africa — the impact of the crises is creating life-threatening situations.   Years of conflict had increased the number of poor and vulnerable people in my country. However  stable economic growth  remittances and international financial and security support were increasing prospects for ameliorating the situation  but the present global crisis has suddenly decreased those prospects  pushing greater numbers of our people into extreme poverty.  We in Sierra Leone are saddled with the effects of trade imbalances in international commerce. Our economy continues to be vigorously challenged by the falling prices of our exports in the international market. This includes diamonds and cash crops. The effect of this intractable problem is that we are not able to garner enough foreign exchange to meet the basic import requirements for our sustenance. We are on the threshold of the tenth year of the implementation of the Millennium Declaration and yet the prospects for achieving the Millennium Development Goals by 2015 remain dismal for Africa.  Many countries in Africa  including mine  have in the last few years registered important improvements in the essential areas of governance and economic and social indicators. My country  Sierra Leone  is putting in place mechanisms to ensure a stable democratic regime. Worldwide indicators show that we have made extremely fast progress in political stability. Our economic growth remains strong at 6 to 9 per cent. My Government has firmed up the aspirations of our people in an Agenda for Change that sets out four clear priority areas: agriculture  energy  infrastructure and reforms to improve delivery of health and education services. We are already delivering results in our priority areas. Key roads are under construction  we have completed a hydroelectric project that is supplying clean  affordable power to Freetown for the first time  and our reforms have ensured that we are the best performer among neighbouring countries according to the Doing Business Index.  My Government could not sustain these results without multilateral support. On 18 and 19 November of this year  we are organizing a Consultative Group Meeting on Sierra Leone in London to dialogue with investors  donors and other partners  and to mobilize support for our efforts in tackling the many challenges facing our country. We see the Sierra Leone conference as a problem-solving dialogue; we aspire to a conference that will build an action-oriented multilateral framework for meeting the challenges we face. My country believes in multilateralism; we believe in dialogue among nations as the most effective means of tackling our problems. We call upon all countries to ensure that the current financial crisis does not deny the many African nations only recently removed from violent conflict the security and prospect of prosperity that we have all worked so hard to achieve.  I would like to address another issue my delegation takes very seriously  one that is interwoven with the financial crisis  poverty and development — the serious threat that climate change poses to human development in general and African nations in   19 09-52320  particular. Despite the scientific consensus that the earth is warming at an alarming rate  progress in reducing greenhouse-gas emissions and limiting global warming to below an increase of 2 degrees Celsius per year has proved elusive. Today  the poorest nations  which contribute the least to the phenomenon  are the most vulnerable. The recent torrential rainfall in Freetown  the capital of Sierra Leone  left scores of people dead  homeless or seriously injured. Drought  hurricanes  floods  changing rainfall patterns  rising sea levels and low crop yields rank high among the key challenges facing the world’s poor. Unfortunately  those nations with the least resources are the most unprepared for such challenges.  It is our obligation to reverse the alarming rate of environmental destruction and depletion of our natural resources. It is in this regard that I wish to reiterate Africa’s common position on climate change  which  among other things  urges developed countries to cut greenhouse-gas emissions by 40 per cent. This is certainly not an ambitious goal. It is the least that we  the most vulnerable  deserve.  We believe that in addition to the necessity of investing in clean development mechanisms  the world’s developed countries must take a leadership role  providing adequate and predictable financial and technical support for less developed countries to foster effective adaptation as well as mitigation measures. We share the Secretary-General’s vision that the Climate Change Summit in Copenhagen represents a unique and powerful opportunity at a critical moment in human history to steer humankind towards a safer  more stable and more sustainable future.  A final threat critical to the future stability of nations around the world is the increasing proliferation of small arms and light weapons  which  as former Secretary-General Kofi Annan recently emphasized  are tantamount to weapons of mass destruction in slow motion  capable of destabilizing countries and entire regions. Given that many African countries routinely face political instability and violent threats  we need to strengthen the national  regional and subregional conflict-resolution mechanisms through which it becomes possible for Africa to control small weapons. Peace and development can be achieved in Africa  in part  by exploration of the peace and security architecture evolving within the African Union  the Economic Community of West African States  the Southern African Development Community and the Peacebuilding Commission.  Against this background  I wish to reiterate that collaborative efforts among members of the international community are crucial to addressing our global problems  and that international support remains critical for the consolidation of hard-won gains by nations emerging from war. It is our hope that the United Nations and our development partners will continue to be our steadfast allies in our ongoing struggle for economic progress and development. In this regard  I urge that we continue to forge enhanced cooperation between the United Nations and the African Union  as well as subregional organizations  cooperation that goes beyond rhetoric and translates into concrete efforts.  As I intimated before the Assembly at the sixty-third session  we have come a long way  thanks to multilateral and bilateral efforts in favour of our survival as a nation. The ongoing peacebuilding efforts  spearheaded by the United Nations Peacebuilding Commission  continue to strengthen the peace-consolidation process in the country. I am pleased to announce that  in return and in a spirit of reciprocity  Sierra Leone has joined the ranks of the troop-contributing countries of United Nations peacekeeping operations.  Multilateralism is vital for international cooperation and for responding to global crises. In the bid to promote effective multilateralism  my Government has continued to urge the international community to effect various reforms aimed at strengthening our intergovernmental organizations  including the Bretton Woods institutions  with a view to making them more inclusive  transparent and democratic in their decision-making processes.   An effective  legitimate and democratic United Nations cannot be achieved without a true reform of the Security Council. The ongoing intergovernmental negotiations on the question of equitable representation on  and increase in the membership of  the Security Council and other matters relating to the Council have progressed through three informal plenary rounds at the last session of the General Assembly. We in Africa have consistently demanded that the historical injustice that is rooted in our underrepresentation and non-representation in the non-permanent and permanent categories of the Council be addressed   09-52320 20  without any further delay. It is in this respect that we have continued to negotiate in good faith and mutual trust. I am hopeful that the outcome of these negotiations will lead to a meaningful reform of this  the principal decision-making organ of the United Nations in the maintenance of international peace and security. We in Africa stand ready  willing and prepared  as always  to resume negotiations during this session.  Let us promote multilateralism and strengthen our collaborative efforts to contain the rising threats to our planet."
"155",6320,"SLV",64,2009,"I would first of all like to thank Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann of the sister Republic of Nicaragua for his work during the sixty-third session of the General Assembly. I would also like to convey our congratulations to Mr. Ali Treki on his election as President of the Assembly at its sixty-fourth session  as well as to wish him every success in his efforts. We would also like to thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his leadership of the United Nations.  A little more than three months ago  by changing its Government after two decades under the same political party  El Salvador began a process to expand and strengthen its democracy. The new Government has set just a few  but overarching  goals aimed at beginning a process of change that pulls the country out of its economic crisis and its social and cultural backwardness while establishing the foundation for the full development of its productive potential  including social integration and fair distribution of its income  as well as making it possible to achieve peace and security  which is our greatest challenge. We have set out the major outlines of my Administration in three words: unite  grow and include.    09-52228 24   First of all  the Government over which I preside is not based on a single political party  let alone on a single faction. It is a Government of national unity focused on two main goals. The first is to put an end to the confrontations  hatred and divisions that have drained a significant amount of vigour from our society and fuelled a bloody civil war that has left behind painful scars. The second is to put in place the foundation for peaceful and secure coexistence.  That means that major national decisions will no longer be taken behind closed doors or out of sight of the majority of our people. Every measure  every step in El Salvador will be discussed and decided at the table through dialogue. Seated at that table will be representatives of the production and labour sectors  as well as of social movements  non-governmental organizations  political parties  churches and academia. It is untrue that the demands of administration require curtailing dialogue as the basic instrument of the decision-making process.  We were able to set up our economic and social council in barely 100 days. That body is charged with proposing and considering social and economic policies that will allow us to successfully address the crisis we are experiencing. In the same period  we were also able to launch an ambitious low-income housing programme that is unprecedented in El Salvador’s history. That programme  which was the result of Government working with the private sector  will produce 100 000 jobs. Work has already begun in the first projects.   That undertaking  like others in the area of social and productive infrastructure  also helps to promote temporary work for young people at risk and to improve the housing and community conditions in the poorest areas. It is also part of the comprehensive anti-crisis plan that I promised during my campaign  which we are carrying out through enormous effort.  Also in less than 100 days  we succeeded in expanding the social safety net and the provision of assistance for the poorest families in 100 rural municipalities. Upon my return to the country  we will launch the first safety net  involving social and employment services in urban communities experiencing extreme poverty. We are responding promptly to the urgent needs of the most excluded  impoverished and neglected groups in our society. I should like to reiterate that all this is being done through an honest and wide-scale dialogue that includes the entire social spectrum of El Salvador.  We have resolutely addressed the concerns resulting from changes in power. It was once believed that changes in Government would lead to instability and uncertainty. The complete opposite happened. We have given legal guarantees and clear examples that the new Government is serious  responsible in managing finances and trustworthy when it comes to both domestic and foreign affairs  including as regards multilateral organizations and friendly countries extending assistance to El Salvador.  In that connection  allow me to thank the countries and groups for that assistance. Their generosity makes us even more determined to follow the path of responsibility  austerity and anti-corruption efforts throughout society and Government.  My country has open wounds that have an impact on our daily lives  including on our family  social and cultural lives. Those wounds include public safety and immigration  which has taken about 3 million of our fellow citizens abroad in search of the work and opportunities they have not found in our homeland.   I should first like to speak briefly about insecurity.  As the Assembly is aware  this is not an exclusively Salvadoran phenomenon. While it is a global problem  it is certainly more pronounced in our region. Organized crime  drug trafficking and the activities of violent criminal youth gangs have developed in the past decade to become the worst threat to the stability of our countries. The policies that have been implemented jointly and within individual countries have not merely fallen short; they have been but a succession of failures. That means that we must increase our joint efforts while using all the means and intelligence at our disposal to confront those scourges. We are faced with a structural phenomenon that hampers the full normal functioning of our societies.  In that regard  I am completely convinced that we must have strong  long-term  decisive and intelligent policies within our countries. However  we will fully defeat crime only if we unite as a single entity that is genuinely determined to defeat organized crime  which is a destructive element that undermines institutions and saps the creative and productive energies of our peoples.   25 09-52228   I have said to my fellow citizens  and I should like to reiterate here  that my Government will do everything the law allows to combat crime with determination and courage. However  this is not a task for a single president or Government; it is also one for society as a whole. I have therefore called for the widest possible level of participation from all groups and people of good will in carrying out what is called “the good fight”  referred to by the Apostle Paul in his first letter to Timothy — a good fight against insecurity  fear and hopelessness. That is the great challenge that brings us together  let us make no mistake.  I should like to propose the holding of an international conference to address these problems in order to consider best practices with which to confront that battle together. To that end  we would require the logistical and financial support of both the Organization of American States and the United Nations.  The other wound to which I referred is the ongoing waves of immigration by Salvadoran men and women that have been taking place for many years. All those who have left have been in their productive years  the most skilled  seeking the work  security and well-being denied them in their own country. With 3 million Salvadorans abroad  remittances equal about 18 per cent of our gross national product. That tearing apart of families is difficult to overcome. It is also a constant reminder of the fact that we have not been able to put in place the necessary conditions to keep our children home  as well as of the fact that we will never be able to achieve our potential  individually or as a society  unless we heal this terrible wound.  I have personally raised the flag of our country’s full democratization  which means that emigrants should have access to the vote that has been denied them to this day. That unjustifiable denial is added to the pain of separation and the loss of human rights to which they are subjected as immigrants.  I have called on political parties  intellectuals  academics and judges to draft the outlines of a national political accord that advances the necessary reforms to expand and strengthen democracy  increase transparency in the workings of political parties  improve the administration of national elections law and — as a key element of my appeal — ensure the right to vote for our brothers and sisters abroad.  We are concerned  moreover  not only by the unstable situation of migrants living abroad with no legal status  suffering constant uncertainty and fear of being deported  but also by the difficult situation they are currently experiencing as a result of the global financial and economic crisis. For this reason a policy for the inclusion and protection of the rights of our migrant population and their families is a priority for us. We will be undertaking measures within and with countries of transit and destination countries to guarantee migrants’ rights everywhere in the world  and in particular the rights of our Salvadorian brothers. We will emphasize an integrated and long-term approach to addressing migration  considering all its causes  manifestations and effects. We will bring this vision to the process initiated at the High-level Dialogue on International Migration and Development  and we pledge our participation at the third Global Forum on Migration and Development  to take place in Athens.  My Government is carrying out a foreign policy geared towards strengthening and broadening relationships of friendship and cooperation with all countries of the world  both at the bilateral and multilateral levels  based on solidarity  mutual respect and compliance with the principles of peaceful coexistence  such as respect for sovereignty  territorial integrity  non-interference in internal affairs  the non-use or threat of use of force  the peaceful settlement of disputes  respect for the right to self-determination and respect for international law and international commitments  in accordance with the principles and purposes of the United Nations Charter.  The foreign policy of El Salvador is free from ideological or partisan political stances. In good faith it is guided not only by national interests and priorities but also by the common goals and interests of the international community  in particular the quest for and promotion of peace  political dialogue  cooperation in solidarity  security and sustainable development. One example of this is the restoration of diplomatic relations between El Salvador and Cuba  which overcame a lingering breach in our country’s hemispheric relations. I also wish to underscore that a further key objective of my Government is to strengthen the ties that we have with our brother countries in Central America.  In this context  I am certain that there will be no solution or future for any of our countries if we act in    09-52228 26  isolation from each other. We long ago emerged from the era of nationalities  and we are now ready to embark on a new phase  one of greater integration. In this regard the European Union is perhaps the most advanced example.  I appeal to my Central American colleagues to consider this point. There are many pending issues that we must address. There are common challenges that we must face shoulder to shoulder. We have everything to gain and nothing to lose in the full integration of our region. In these years of the bicentenary we must regain the free and independent spirit of our ancestors  which was exemplified in the concept of a Central American union as a basis for development  well-being and peace for our peoples. A first step would be to convene a summit that would focus on a balanced integration process and an analysis of greater transfer of competencies to strengthen the mechanisms of supra-nationality  in order to further the aims and principles established in the Tegucigalpa Protocol  to ensure its credibility and viability.  Among the aims  of course  would be to strengthen regional democratic institutions  helping us to avoid occurrences such as the Honduran coup d’état  of which members are all well aware. Working together we must ensure that it will be impossible to return to the times of authoritarianism or military or civilian-military dictatorships. The coup d’état in Honduras must not be allowed to set a precedent which will jeopardize the achievements that we have reached in terms of regional stability and democratic institutions. The de facto Government in our brother country has ignored the clamour of voices raised by the international community  calling for Honduras to return as quickly as possible to constitutional order through dialogue and political negotiation in accordance with human rights and the fundamental freedoms of the Honduran people.  Until the Constitution is restored in Honduras through the immediate reinstatement of President Zelaya and the creation of a government of national unity in keeping with the San José Agreement  the electoral process currently being prepared in our brother country will lack the legitimacy or transparency necessary to guarantee reliable results which might help resolve the crisis in our brother country.  The United Nations has played and will play a leading role in the maintenance of international peace and security and in the promotion of democracy and development. El Salvador is a leading example: the Organization helped in reaching the Peace Agreements that succeeded in resolving our internal conflict — a contribution for which I am deeply grateful  because it led us from war to peace and from peace to a phase of transition to democratization and development. In this regard we will engage in a major review of the international agenda in order to set priorities and to ensure compliance with the key guidelines issued by this global Organization and which benefit the well-being and dignity of our peoples. We are implementing policies that are geared towards meeting the commitments we have entered into at major international conferences  in particular the Millennium Development Goals and the promotion and full protection of human rights. We will also be joining international agreements aimed at strengthening human rights and freedoms.  We believe in the role that the United Nations has played in the field of cooperation and development  and we reiterate our support for the reform of its principal organs  programmes and subsidiary bodies  which will allow the Organization to adapt to the demands and complexities of new challenges  in particular through the interrelationship and interaction that exist among political  economic  social  environmental and security phenomena.  Thus we commit ourselves to strengthening our national system for the protection of human rights and to promoting and guaranteeing a policy of justice  truth and compensation for serious infringements of human rights  by implementing a policy of openness  honesty and transparency in public affairs.  The effects of the international crisis that broke out last year have been felt by all  but especially by poor and developing countries whose economies are dependent on large markets and that suffer from the consequences of the decline of economic activity  employment and consumption. Given this situation  international solidarity and cooperation take on extreme importance for developing countries  which have limited natural and financial resources and are very vulnerable. In this regard we call upon the industrialized countries and on the donor community to join every international effort and initiative to overcome the current challenges  which jeopardize   27 09-52228  achievements made to date and future progress for humankind.  We recommend taking full advantage of the experience and expertise within the United Nations system in fostering international cooperation and coordinating efforts to achieve common goals. In this context we appeal particularly to developed countries to ensure follow-up  support for and implementation of the recommendations and commitments set out in the Monterrey Consensus and the Follow-up International Conference on Financing for Development to Review the Implementation of the Monterrey Consensus that took place in Doha in 2008  as well as the recommendations contained in the Outcome of the Conference on the World Economic and Financial Crisis and Its Impact on Development (resolution 63/303  annex)  in particular the need for donors to maintain and fulfil their commitments and objectives with regard to official development assistance. To that end  there is a need for political resolve to reform the international financial structure and system in order to address the current difficulties.  The high-level meeting on climate change convened by the Secretary-General provided us with an opportunity to consider that issue  especially with respect to compliance by States  and in particular the industrialized countries  with the provisions of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  which was adopted shortly before the Earth Summit  and with later commitments to eliminate the danger posed by environmental degradation and ongoing activities that have exacerbated climate change. We therefore hope that we will act in earnest  responsibly and decisively at the Copenhagen conference to achieve a new agreement in this area so as to ensure that States do not put their own interests before the common well-being of humankind. It is time to adopt measures and mechanisms to rectify the mistakes and shortcomings of the past  and to launch a process to bring development into harmony with environmental protections.  As participants here are aware  in my country we have done away with ideological prejudices and stereotypes in our international relations. We believe in multilateralism and in particular in the systems of our continental organization  the Organization of American States  and of the United Nations. We believe in the rich and valuable contribution that new and emerging nations can make to the work of those two systems. We believe that the future of humankind largely depends on the intelligence  honour and generosity of the larger nations in ensuring the full and fair development of emerging countries so as to put an end to the discrimination and differences that offend human nature.  I thank the General Assembly for its attention and its support for my country and the Salvadoran people."
"156",6345,"SMR",64,2009,"Mr. President  I wish to congratulate you on your election as the head of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session and to assure you that the delegation of the Republic of San Marino will do its utmost in collaborating with you throughout the session.  In my first speech before this Assembly as Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of San Marino  I would like to express my most sincere thanks to the Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon  for guiding this Organization with great energy and extraordinary dedication. I wish to mention his admirable commitment in the area of reform and his constant and important involvement in world affairs.  The United Nations reform process is fundamental to ensuring future world stability and must remain a priority in our efforts  not only because we have the duty to guarantee that the Organization and all its activities are fully effective  but in particular in order to preserve its primary and essential value. We cannot afford to witness a decentralization of the substantial role of the United Nations caused by the impossibility of reaching agreement on measures to be implemented for the improvement of its functioning.   Moreover  I would like to express the appreciation of San Marino for the work accomplished in the General Assembly with the contribution of all States Members of the United Nations  as well as for the attention paid to particularly relevant issues  such as the world economic and financial crisis  climate change and the global food crisis.  The Republic of San Marino supports the process of the revitalization of the General Assembly. That process is a political reform necessary to reaffirm the Assembly’s role as the most representative body of the United Nations  as well as the role and leadership of its President. San Marino believes that the reform should make the activities of the General Assembly more efficient and effective  improve its relations with the other main United Nations bodies to avoid duplication of work and aim at the effective implementation of its resolutions.  The Security Council reform process  which the Republic of San Marino has been following with commitment and interest since the beginning  is also very important. We are grateful to the Afghan Chair for the important activity carried out and for the way in which it has presided over the intergovernmental negotiations aimed at reaching the widest possible political agreement on Security Council reforms.  San Marino believes that the aims of the reform should be to make the Security Council more democratic  transparent  efficient  accountable and    09-52598 2  representative  to restore the balance between the Security Council and the General Assembly  and to enhance its cooperation with the Secretariat. It is important that this process allow for the development of a sense of belonging to the Security Council among all Member States  thus avoiding the risk that it could be perceived as an isolated body within the United Nations. Moreover  the reform should take into consideration the legitimate interest of all States  big and small  in being elected to the Security Council.  San Marino participates with commitment and interest in the intergovernmental negotiations on the reform of the Security Council and regrets that  to date  no reasonable compromise has been reached to make it more representative  democratic and possibly less paralyzed by cross-vetoes concerning fundamental issues.  Mr. Acharya (Nepal)  Vice-President  took the Chair.  The reforms of the General Assembly and the Security Council are encompassed in a wider process of transformation and strengthening of the role of the United Nations within the global governance system. San Marino believes that the United Nations plays and must continue to play a pivotal role in managing the global governance system and that the United Nations reform process must be aimed at reaching this objective.  Today’s world is characterized by marked differences in terms of power  wealth  income and social well-being among nations and peoples  and within individual nations. Unfortunately  the world is beset by numerous ethnic and interreligious conflicts  which are sometimes fuelled by economic and geopolitical factors originating outside the area of the conflict. Moreover  global warming  which is also a consequence of indiscriminate energy consumption in developed and developing countries  is one of the major causes of disasters and is leading  inter alia  to a reduction in agricultural yields in tropical and subtropical countries. Furthermore  this year in particular the world economy has undergone one of the most devastating financial crises in history  whose consequences are clear to everyone.  These challenges can be faced only through global and coordinated action  and the United Nations has the responsibility and the duty to be at the centre of this process. Only by tapping into the rich and varied cultures and traditions represented by the United Nations is it possible to manage the global governance system in such a way as to achieve sustainable human development. That the United Nations might relinquish its role as leader of the global governance system in favour of other bodies would be a defeat for all.  Unfortunately  the widespread poverty that affects such a large percentage of the global population  causing hunger  disease and underdevelopment  is one of the most endemic problems faced by States. Despite the efforts made and the commitments undertaken at a global level  poverty continues to plague the whole planet.  San Marino values the efforts and success of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) over the last 60 years and is proud to host Jacques Diouf  FAO Director-General  as the official speaker at the investiture ceremony of the new Captains-Regent  the heads of State of the Republic of San Marino  which will take place on 1 October 2009.  San Marino endorses the Millennium Development Goals — which have unfortunately become more difficult to achieve because of the crisis we are currently facing — and believes we must continue in our commitment.  The strengthening of multilateralism — included by the Assembly President in the theme proposed for this general debate  namely “Effective responses to global crises: strengthening multilateralism and dialogue among civilizations for international peace  security and development” — is  in my opinion  a central element. In fact  international organizations  and the United Nations in the first instance  promote the affirmation of democracy  rule of law  freedoms and human rights as a condition for economic and social development  cultural growth and education.  The current world economic and financial crisis is the greatest global disaster since the very birth of the United Nations  all the more so because it has added to a severe food crisis that has affected many regions of the world. As this crisis concerns all countries and regions indiscriminately  it is now one of the major challenges our Organization has to face.  The Republic of San Marino  as a small State  attaches great importance to the role of the General Assembly in the lives of our nations. It has welcomed the high-level Conference on the World Financial and   3 09-52598  Economic Crisis and has supported its outcome document (resolution 63/303  annex)  which is the result of long and complex negotiations. However  I note with regret that the uncertainty in the preparation of the Conference and the difficulties encountered in drafting the final document discouraged the participation of many world leaders  whose presence could have made that United Nations conference an historic event.  The task of the United Nations is to find  through coordinated and global action  the right methods to mitigate the impact of the crisis and to achieve sustainable economic growth and development  taking into account the negative effects of the crisis on the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals.  Climate change has become a central issue on the United Nations agenda in the last three years  thanks to the commitment and efforts undertaken by the Secretary-General in this regard. Climate change  which in the 1990s was already among the main environmental concerns  has now become an absolute priority on the political agenda of all States  including the smallest ones like our Republic. The deep changes caused by human intervention in the energy dynamics of the climate system are indeed the elements of this concern for the present and immediate future. Therefore  urgent and significant changes in social and economic development patterns cannot be further postponed.  San Marino has recently submitted its first national communication in accordance with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. That communication represents the beginning of a process  first of all of a social and cultural nature  aimed at making all citizens of our country aware of the need to face climate changes and effectively commit to reducing as much as possible the impact of these changes.  Among the most serious challenges we have to face at national and international levels  terrorism in all its forms and manifestations is of primary importance. The Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy adopted by the General Assembly in 2006 represents a fundamental initiative  because for the first time all Member States agreed to a common strategic and operational approach to counter terrorism. Such a strategy laid the foundations for a coordinated response to this emergency by envisaging preventive measures and the strengthening of the role of the United Nations in the fight against terrorism. It also recognizes that counter-terrorism measures and the protection of human rights are not conflicting goals; on the contrary  they are complementary and mutually reinforcing.  However  an effective response to terrorism must also be based on education in order to foster understanding and respect for each other as a sine qua non condition for achieving justice and peace. Indeed  hatred  lack of understanding and injustice provide breeding grounds for terrorist groups and organizations to recruit new members.  My country focuses great attention  both at the national and international levels  to the promotion and protection of human rights  with special attention paid to those of the weakest and most vulnerable groups. I am pleased to recall that this year we celebrate the twentieth anniversary of the adoption of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child  a fundamental instrument that has been ratified by a large number of States. However  we must not forget that still today 9.2 million children under the age of five die every year from largely preventable causes and more than 100 million school-age children do not have access to education. Furthermore  many children are robbed of their childhood  are victims of sexual violence  are used by armies or armed groups as soldiers or sold as sexual slaves.  San Marino applauds and supports the United Nations and UNICEF for the efforts undertaken worldwide in order to improve the life of these children. We also actively endorse the United Nations commitment to women’s rights.  Finally  the protection of human rights is strictly connected to the need to guarantee every human being and every population the possibility of living in peace and justice. It is therefore necessary to give new momentum to the disarmament process. An important step was taken last year in this regard by adopting the Convention on Cluster Munitions  an instrument that will prove essential to protecting affected populations from those weapons  which have devastating effects on civilians. The Republic of San Marino attaches great importance to this Convention  which is focused on human dignity and the interests of victims  and hopes that it will promptly enter into force. We therefore call upon the States that have not yet ratified it to do so as soon as possible."
"157",6382,"SOM",64,2009,"I would like to begin by congratulating Mr. Ali Treki on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. We are confident that the international community will greatly benefit from his experience and wisdom on the political and human fronts  and at the local and international levels. I also take this opportunity warmly to thank the Secretary-General and all Governments  international organizations and permanent members who have offered support and have promoted peace and stability in Somalia  and who have delivered to our country the aid necessary to protect our sovereignty  territorial integrity and unity.   I wish to express our condolences to the families of those who have lost their lives in defence of peace and stability in Somalia. I would particularly like to thank the African Union  which has made tremendous sacrifices for the cause of peace in Somalia.   I would now like to talk about the efforts and progress made by the Government of Somalia since it came to power through the Djibouti peace process — progress made despite the enormous difficulties and challenges facing the Somali nation  particularly given that it was established after 18 years of anarchy and chaos. My Government’s priorities include improving the security situation  promoting efforts towards reconciliation and providing essential humanitarian assistance to the displaced and the suffering in our country.   Unfortunately  however  the rebels are endeavouring to overthrow the Somali Government  which is still taking its first steps in achieving security. These rebel elements have conducted a violent insurrection against the Government  fuelled by the negative effects and consequences of the past 18 years  which are further compounded by prevailing high unemployment and our country’s weakness in the field of security. It is clear that extremist foreign elements have joined the ranks of the insurgency and some of these foreign extremists hold key rebel leadership positions.  I would like to recall that we thwarted the attempted coup d’état perpetrated by the rebels against the Government. We believe that we were able to prevail thanks  first and foremost  to God  and then through the efforts of our Government and people and the help we received from the international community and the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM). We are currently endeavouring to promote and bolster the Somali security forces  to create new naval forces and a new coast guard to tackle the problem of piracy  which continues to threaten international shipping in the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean. However  despite all our achievements we still have a long road to travel.   Rebellion in Somalia is a new form of insurgency that is emerging in the world today. This rebellion is conducted by foreign and Somali extremists who are against Islam  against peace  against security and against stability. They are spoilers who sow destruction and take exploit the chaos and anarchy that have existed in Somalia since 1991.   We suggest that what is happening in Somalia should not be underestimated or taken lightly. The international community should take prompt and decisive steps to ensure that our people are not held hostage by these extremist groups who are working against our freedom and our destiny. From this rostrum I would like to state that if the world does not comprehend the gravity of what is happening in Somalia  then the consequences will be very harmful. The troubles we are experiencing threaten to proliferate into neighbouring countries and indeed throughout the world.   The problem of international terrorism is not confined to Somalia and this problem should be addressed at the international level.    19 09-52463   I turn now to the issue of piracy  which has recently become a matter of major concern for the international community. The phenomenon of piracy is closely linked to the current security situation in Somalia. As a result  as long as the security situation in Somalia remains unchanged  piracy will continue in one way or another. We would like to say  however  that there has of late been a reduction of piracy as a result of collective international endeavours. Still  it remains essential to make additional efforts to combat piracy.  Toxic waste sunk off the Somali coast  unlawful fishing and the pillaging of national wealth are a violation of Somali sovereignty and cause considerable damage  which has a negative effect on the environment through the pollution caused.   We are resolved to engage in a political dialogue that is open to all Somali stakeholders  including the armed rebels.   We are determined to sit down at the negotiating table with all parties  even those who are against the Government  any time and any place  in order to end the conflict raging in our country. We will spare no effort to end the conflict and find a lasting political solution. We will ensure the security of our people and protect our sovereignty and territorial integrity. However  the extremists do not believe in the benefit of any manner of dialogue or negotiation; they believe only in guns and cannons.   We are ready to establish a firm foundation for an open  transparent and participatory democratic political system by creating sound democratic institutions that reflect the collective political will and the cultural values of the Somali people. That system will be based on an institutional regime and constitutional mechanisms designed to protect human rights and the rule of law.  Similarly  we will foster genuine Islamic principles that encourage tolerance  personal freedoms  respect for individual rights and equal rights for all under the law  without regard to gender  clan or ethnic origin.  In addition  we will work tirelessly towards establishing a free-market economic system to attract foreign direct investment and encourage private ownership. The system we will introduce will have sound and effective financial institutions with strong built-in anti-corruption mechanisms.  We will use all available means to rebuild a national Somali State that is at peace with itself  with its neighbours and with the international community. Furthermore  we intend to cooperate closely with the international community in the security sphere.  At this trying moment in history  Somalia urgently needs the support and assistance of the international community  in particular in the form of security and humanitarian aid. Since 1991  Somalia has not enjoyed peace  stability or security. Thus  it has been difficult to achieve social and economic development and to protect human rights.   Security and stability may be established if certain essential measures are taken  including promotion of the security and police components  the judiciary and administrative institutions. African Union troops should be increased to a necessary level and augmented by other troops  provided that they are sufficiently funded  trained and equipped to carry out their task. In order to restore security in Somalia  those measures must be implemented decisively and as soon as possible. In the context of humanitarian assistance  it must be emphasized that the situation of refugees  both within Somalia and outside its borders  continues to deteriorate. There are nearly 3.8 million people in the country requiring humanitarian assistance. Our people are experiencing a real humanitarian tragedy that is compounded by several years of drought. Humanitarian access to those in need is considerably hampered by the security situation that has deteriorated as a result of the conflict.  In connection with Security Council resolutions on the arms embargo  I urge the Council to reconsider the matter and appeal to it to assist us in strengthening our security forces without which any endeavour to rebuild infrastructure and achieve security and stability in Somalia will be impossible.  On the donors conference held in Brussels in April 2009 pursuant to Security Council resolution 1863 (2009)  we wish to ask donor countries which have made funds available to Somalia to speed up the allocation of additional funding. I also urge United    09-52463 20  Nations Member States and Security Council members to take further measures to support the Republic of Somalia more effectively in order to end the intransigence of the extremists and to ensure that no further obstacles exist to rehabilitating Somalia and rebuilding its infrastructure so that we can bring an end to the genuine daily tragedy of the people in Somalia.  We firmly believe that our progress on security is likely to enable us to counter the negative economic and social impacts of the chaotic events of the past 18 years. Somalia would be in a position to revive the entrepreneurial spirit of the people of Somalia. We have already begun to make tangible progress with remittances from Somalis abroad. If Somalia enjoyed some level of stability and security our economy could progress reasonably in the coming years. In any event  peace  stability and development are all interlinked; there can be no peace without development or development without peace and stability.   The worldwide economic decline has severely affected the people of Somalia and has placed an additional burden on their shoulders. From this rostrum  we reiterate our appeal for joint  urgent action for Somalia. I stand before the Assembly fully confident in the future of Somalia. It is a country with vast natural and human resources. We believe and we are confident that  with support  we will be able to make genuine and concrete progress."
"158",6420,"STP",64,2009,"Before anything else  allow me to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Ali Treki of Libya  a country with which we maintain excellent relations of brotherhood  for his election to the important post of President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session  which role he will certainly carry out with his usual level of excellence. I would also like to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann for his excellent work on the world economic crisis during his presidency at the sixty-third session.  A year has passed since the opening of the Assembly’s sixty-third session  and yet we have still not recovered from the full effects of the global economic crisis  despite enormous efforts on the part of developed countries. The same distortions in the world’s economy remain.   But it is not just economic and financial problems that we face. Our biggest challenge today is guaranteeing the future of our planet  not just in the economic sense  but also resolving climate change issues that threaten the very survival of small island nations like Sao Tome and Principe. Though our carbon emissions are insignificant and our forests play a key role as part of the world’s lungs  rising sea levels are already causing coastal erosion around our country.  Time is no longer on our side but has become our unforgiving judge. There is no time for more unfounded justifications for the non-fulfilment of the Kyoto Protocol. We cannot continue evading these   09-52320 16  essential environmental issues  which are not a question of developing countries against developed ones. We need urgent measures that are global and concrete to save us from this crisis.  The report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization (A/64/1) contains some important points to which we have given considerable attention  because my country shares similar concerns. I am referring to the urgent need for reform of the United Nations system. Africa  especially its small countries on the periphery  continues mired in the deepest poverty. Our problems are particularly difficult to solve due to a combination of adverse factors that deserve an approach from the international community that is more systematic  more diligent and more coordinated.  There have been several crises in 2009  and we have to re-think together the future of the new world economic order. Those crises affect all countries and demand a global response. Sao Tome and Principe is a micro-State with a micro-economy  and thus it is poor and vulnerable. As such  it is not immune to the effects of those crises.  We need to reinforce the merits of multilateralism as an instrument through which the international community can promote peace and development. Therefore  Sao Tome and Principe wants to demonstrate its support for the institutionalization of this agenda within the framework of the United Nations. In a world confronting a global economic and financial crisis  along with the negative impact of climate changes  there is a need to guarantee food security and energy security  to deal with migrations and pandemics and numerous regional conflicts of increasing complexity and associated risks.   The only way we can face these crises is through active multilateralism  based on international law and on the principles of the United Nations Charter  and through reaffirming our commitment to achieving the goals set out in the United Nations 2005 World Summit. We are well aware that we will achieve those goals only through a renewed multilateral system  integrated in a world organization that is stronger  more egalitarian and with more solidarity.  In this framework we call for support for the oft-repeated proposal for reforming the United Nations system  and particularly the issue of permanent members of the Security Council. We believe that this issue cannot be endlessly put off. There must be more justice in the context of the United Nations. The African States must have a voice and cannot be ignored in this process of reform of our Organization. That is why I want to state my complete agreement with what was said from this tribune yesterday  at the 3rd meeting  by the President of the African Union  our brother-leader Qadhafi  reclaiming better participation by the African countries as permanent members of the Security Council.   We are beginning the last five years in the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The past five years have presented us with the biggest challenges facing global society: poverty  pandemics  environmental degradation — everything that galvanized the world’s position that was translated into the declaration that we heard yesterday. The goals and hopes that this declaration embodies need attention. I can say that in Sao Tome and Principe we have made determined efforts  especially to achieve the Goals in the areas of health and education. We are almost there  although we are yet not completely satisfied.  The biggest debates related to global warming concentrate on substitutions for fossil fuels in order to reduce carbon emissions that contribute to the greenhouse effect. This debate has gone on as temperatures have risen  causing the glaciers and polar ice caps to melt  which in turn has already caused a rise in the sea level. As I mentioned earlier  that is threatening our country.  These environmental changes present a strategic challenge for countries  with increasing global insecurity caused by the effects of violent storms  droughts  massive migrations and pandemics  which lead to an increase in poverty  environmental degradation and weakening national Governments. Experts in this field call our attention to the fact that these climate changes may result in an unprecedented need to provide emergency food aid  which could cause a crisis of sustainability for the international community.   The negotiations in the framework of the United Nations are aimed at creating a substitute for the 1997 Kyoto Protocol  which establishes limits on greenhouse gas emissions by 2012 for 37 countries in the developed world and is an attempt to profoundly alter the world climate situation.   17 09-52320   We hope the 2020 objectives can be formalized during the Copenhagen summit. Even in the meetings this week  at the Assembly’s current session  we have seen growing concern on the part of the international community  at the level of the Secretary-General and in the Alliance of Small Island Developing States  with regard to the success of this process.  Whenever I speak before the General Assembly  I conclude by mentioning two continuing cases of injustice: that of the Republic of China on Taiwan and that of the trade embargo against Cuba.   Despite everything  there are positive signs on the international scene  for which we are grateful. We welcome the recent positive developments between the Republic of China on Taiwan and the People’s Republic of China. We continue to support increased participation at the United Nations for the Republic of China on Taiwan. In that regard  we welcome the admission of that nation of 23 million people as an observer at the World Health Organization. We hope that other United Nations agencies  such as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the International Civil Aviation Organization  can also take advantage of the valuable contributions that that developed country can make with respect to the urgent needs of the Organization.  Unfortunately  however  while we can express a certain satisfaction concerning the issue of the Republic of China on Taiwan  we cannot do so with regard to the trade embargo against Cuba; indeed  we are greatly disappointed in that area. But we dare to remain hopeful that the new United States Administration will have the courage and determination to shortly address this issue in the same manner as it has dealt with that of Guantánamo. I wish to stress that the road ahead of us is very difficult and long. There must be global cooperation in a context of availability and responsibility to ensure sustainable development for all countries. I therefore appeal for greater cooperation between donor and beneficiary countries and greater consultation not only with Government institutions  but also with institutions more familiar with the needs of people on the ground. I am referring specifically to rural communities  teachers  doctors  nurses  farmers  fishermen and all those in the productive sectors of our countries.   For the Government and the people of Sao Tome and Principe  the United Nations remains an indispensable Organization where there should be no differences among Member States. The United Nations must continue its mission of maintaining peace and security and promoting international development. Those are the Organization’s objectives to ensure the betterment of our world."
"159",6461,"SUR",64,2009,"On behalf of my delegation I congratulate Mr. Ali Treki on his election as President of the sixty-fourth session of the General Assembly. I am sure that his wisdom and experience will guide us as we address the challenges on the global agenda. I would like to pay tribute to the important work of your predecessor Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann. He led the Assembly’s sixty-third session through complex discussions and extensive investigations in a spirit of responsibility and good faith. I also take this opportunity to commend the Secretary-General and his staff for their continued dedication in overseeing the ongoing efforts for improving the working methods of the Organization and its interaction with Member States.  The world continues to face many challenges  both traditional and new. Whilst traditional challenges to international peace and security persist  we also have to cope with non-traditional threats such as pervasive poverty  deadly diseases  increased frequency and intensity of natural disasters and environmental degradation. Added to those challenges are the energy  food  financial and economic crises  all of which are hampering the realization of the Millennium Development Goals by the target date of 2015.  Our growing interdependence in today’s world only strengthens the understanding that current challenges transcend national borders and therefore require concerted action and responses from the international community. The United Nations therefore remains the central forum for addressing global issues  and we continue to advocate effective multilateralism not as an option but as a necessity.  In this regard we deem it indispensable for the United Nations to continue its reform efforts. This should include meaningful reform of the Security Council  to make it more effective and responsive to today’s challenging world. Of equal importance is strengthened cooperation within and between regional groups. We should continue to promote and pursue intensified channels of political dialogue between regional groups in reaffirming our shared commitment to multilateralism.  In this spirit  my country participates in regional and interregional endeavours to strengthen political  economic  cultural and social cooperation and integration. I would like to highlight the importance of the United Nations as an effective agent in advancing multilateralism and emphasize the need for it to strengthen its role of consultation and coordination with regional organizations.  The urgency of the threat posed by climate change requires the same degree of multilateral engagement as has been demonstrated in areas ranging from the fight against the uncontrolled spread of illicit small arms and light weapons  the fight against international terrorism and the effort to control HIV/AIDS  on the one hand  and peacekeeping and peacebuilding  the advancement of women and the protection of human rights  on the other.  We express our appreciation to the Secretary-General for convening the recent Summit on Climate Change to garner the necessary political support to “seal the deal” in Copenhagen. Suriname expects an agreement in Copenhagen with ambitious mitigation and adaptation targets. We expect the commitments necessary to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases in appropriate quantities and to support adaptation in developing countries. Countries that are historically   23 09-52470  responsible for the current emissions of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere should take the lead in this area. In the spirit of common but differentiated responsibilities  we look forward to appropriate mitigation efforts by developing countries. As a high-forest low-deforestation (HFLD) country  Suriname will continue with its efforts to manage its forests sustainably. In this way we aim to keep and improve the climate-stabilizing capacity of our standing forests. We attach great importance to the establishment of a future forest carbon-mitigation regime providing positive incentives to HFLD countries. In this regard we call your attention to the report of the Informal Working Group on Interim Finance for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD). This report estimates that  if financing of €15 billion to €25 billion is available for the 2010-2015 period  a 25 per cent reduction in annual global deforestation rates will be achievable by 2015. In this regard we call upon institutions and fellow Member States to support United Nations REDD+ efforts in recognition of the beneficial potential of tropical forests in mitigating climate change.  Suriname has emphasized its support for the promotion of dialogue among civilizations and the culture of peace in various international forums  especially through the full implementation of the Global Agenda and Programme of Action for Dialogue among Civilizations  as well as the Declaration and Programme of Action on a Culture of Peace (resolutions 56/6 and 53/243  respectively).  Our democracy serves as an illustration of our quest for peace  security and development. Various ethnic groups with different multicultural backgrounds and religious traditions have come a long way in coexisting and cooperating in a harmonious and peaceful way. This engagement is reflected in the political representation of our administration. It is within this atmosphere of democratic values  of high levels of religious and ethnic tolerance  that we are building a society that can prosper and engage with the region and the world beyond. In order to achieve international peace  security and development  cooperation should be based upon constructive and respectful dialogue. This dialogue should be guided by a spirit of tolerance  acceptance and trust among religions  peoples and cultures. Only with mutual trust and understanding will we be able to overcome international tensions.  The Secretary-General recently emphasized the importance of education for development. Education has always been the foundation of economic opportunity and prosperity. Knowledge and advanced skills are critical tools for enhancing every country’s economic potential  growth and standard of living. This is why we have to join our efforts to improve the capacity of countries to adopt  disseminate and maximize technological advances. Improved international cooperation aimed at creating better educational systems will help developing countries progress faster towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals  particularly those related to all levels of education  health and gender equality.  The promotion and protection of human rights are among the most effective strategies for eliminating inequalities between social groups and within and between countries  and Suriname therefore remains committed to the promotion and protection of all human rights.   With regard to what is called the supreme international crime — namely  the crime of aggression — Suriname expresses the hope that a decision on the elements of crime will be taken very soon. The upcoming Review Conference of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court  to be held in Uganda next year  should therefore address this issue seriously.  For more than 60 years the United Nations has been able to build confidence and understanding between Member States and help keep global peace. My delegation reiterates its commitment to development  respect for human rights and international peace and security. We will continue to engage in constructive dialogue aimed at contributing to a better future for all."
"160",6485,"SVK",64,2009,"It is a great privilege and honour for me to address the General Assembly  to which people of the world look with high hopes and expectations to find effective solutions to the multitude of challenges and threats that spare no one.   First  let me congratulate you  Sir  on the assumption of your duties as President of the General Assembly at the sixty-fourth session and also express my delegation’s appreciation to your predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann  for his work during the sixty-third session.  Slovakia fully associates itself with the statement delivered earlier by the Prime Minister of Sweden on behalf of the European Union. I would like to contribute to this debate with some additional remarks.  Slovakia is a keen believer in effective multilateralism and the central role of the United Nations in that regard. We therefore greatly welcome the main theme of our deliberations during this general debate  with a focus on achieving tangible results on the three pillars of the work of the United Nations: peace and security  human rights and development.  We welcome the attention that the Organization has paid to the issue of climate change  as well as to increasing food security and eliminating the negative effects of the financial and economic crisis  especially in the most vulnerable States and populations. Slovakia calls for reaching an ambitious  balanced and comprehensive agreement on climate change in Copenhagen at the end of 2009 that will replace the Kyoto Protocol. Also  we need to elaborate an action plan and strengthen global strategies for food security in the world. It is essential not to lose sight of the Millennium Development Goals and to maintain our efforts to achieve them by the year 2015.  We have in recent years invested considerable effort in elaborating and implementing our own concept of official development assistance  through a number of bilateral and multilateral projects. The western Balkans  Central Asia  Afghanistan and Africa have been among our priority geographic areas in this regard.  Slovakia’s commitment to the issues of economic and social development prompted us to present our candidature for membership of the United Nations Economic and Social Council at the elections to be held in the General Assembly later this year. We appreciate the endorsement of our candidature by the Group of Eastern European and other States and will do our best to gain the trust and support of all of the Organization’s Member States. Slovakia is committed to serving as an active and engaged member of the Economic and Social Council  and would like to contribute tangibly to making that important United Nations organ as relevant and as effective as possible.  The United Nations has achieved remarkable results in peacekeeping over past decades. We recognize its continued efforts to adapt peacekeeping so that it can respond better to current and future challenges. More emphasis should be put on ensuring that peacekeepers and other United Nations actors on the ground are properly equipped and trained  including in the area of the so-called critical capabilities. It is our belief that preventive diplomacy should be used whenever possible in order to avoid conflicts in the first place.  Slovakia continues to be actively engaged in numerous peace and security endeavours of the international community. We are currently participating in international crisis-management operations under United Nations command or Security Council mandate in Afghanistan  Cyprus  Kosovo  Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Middle East. We are doing our best to contribute to peacekeeping  peacebuilding  stabilization and reconstruction efforts in those parts of the world and will continue to do so in the future.  In addition  Slovakia remains actively engaged in the area of security sector reform  an issue that we began promoting within the United Nations during our non-permanent membership in the Security Council. Slovakia  as the initiator and chair of the United Nations Group of Friends of Security Sector Reform  will continue working to ensure that the United    09-52586 48  Nations system is able to react in an adequate  timely and systematic manner to the needs of Member States relating to security sector reform. After a useful African regional workshop  held in Cape Town as a joint South African and Slovak project  we have now teamed up with key partners  namely  Argentina and Indonesia  in two other important regions  Latin America and South-East Asia. The Buenos Aires workshop will be held just a few days from now.  As I have already mentioned  we are glad to see that significant progress has been achieved in preventive diplomacy  conflict prevention and mediation support. This has recently been demonstrated  for example  in the role played by United Nations mediation teams in helping to find peaceful and negotiated solutions to crises in Kenya  Zimbabwe  Madagascar and elsewhere. Slovakia will contribute further to that work. We are  in this regard  very pleased that the first United Nations Regional Centre for Preventive Diplomacy  located in Central Asia and led by a Slovak representative  has achieved good results so far and has fully proved itself as a meaningful and necessary project. We are convinced that issues such as conflict prevention cannot be seen in isolation. They are connected with respect for human rights  protection of civilians  gender equality  protection of children in armed conflict and so forth. As a serving member of the United Nations Human Rights Council  Slovakia works to promote universal respect for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all  at national and international levels.  Among the key tools that the United Nations has at its disposal for protecting those who are most endangered and vulnerable is the concept of responsibility to protect  one of the most important achievements of the 2005 World Summit. We believe the international community should focus more on the protection of civilian populations from genocide  war crimes  ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. Nor can we forget our obligation  under international law  to prevent the incitement of those most serious crimes  which should be referred to the International Criminal Court  established for the purpose of ending impunity for perpetrators of such crimes.  Much of the Organization’s ability to deal with current threats and challenges depends on the existing institutional framework. The United Nations Security Council is at the centre of that framework. Slovakia is a long-term advocate of enlarging the Security Council in both of its membership categories. The composition of an enlarged Security Council should better reflect new global realities. Appropriate attention must also be paid to the Council’s working methods. We are pleased that the intergovernmental negotiations have begun and believe that things will move forward in the interest of making the Security Council a truly relevant and efficient body.  The old saying “If you seek peace  prepare for war” has resulted in an unprecedented arms race  which in itself has become a source of fear and insecurity. Slovakia is particularly concerned about the risk of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery falling into the hands of non-State actors  especially terrorist groups. In this connection  Slovakia is ready to work with all partners towards the successful outcome of the 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  which should result in an enhanced international nuclear non-proliferation regime. Our priority is to outlaw nuclear testing and see the Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty come into force. Slovakia also calls for an early start to substantive negotiations on an arms trade treaty  which is essential for reducing the unacceptable human cost resulting from the proliferation of conventional arms.  Slovakia  together with the other members of the European Union  is deeply concerned about Iran’s continued defiance despite its international obligations  including the Security Council’s demands that it suspend its nuclear activities. We note that Iran has agreed to continue talks with the P5+1 group of the five permanent members of the Security Council plus Germany  and we call on Iran to commit to diplomatic negotiations in order to restore the trust of the international community and make real and urgently needed progress. The deteriorating human rights situation and the violent suppression of the popular protests that erupted in Iran after the elections in June is a cause of much concern to Slovakia. We have also repeatedly and strongly condemned the nuclear test and missile launches carried out by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. We call on North Korea to reverse its position on the Non-Proliferation Treaty and join the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.  Let me now turn to some regional issues that Slovakia pays particular attention to. As a matter of priority  Slovakia has been closely following   49 09-52586  developments in the western Balkans. We continue to promote full respect for international law  including the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States within their internationally recognized borders. At the same time  we welcome and support a peaceful and constructive approach to seeking solutions to disputes. We believe that the future of the entire region and its people lies in the European perspective and that there is no meaningful alternative to that.  Promotion of full respect for international law and the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States within their internationally recognized borders is also the principle that guides us in the case of Georgia. Slovakia was very disappointed when  earlier this year  the Security Council was unable to agree on extending the mandate of the United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia. The termination of the Mission complicates the already unstable situation in the region  as well as the security conditions for civilians in the conflict zone. We firmly support a peaceful and lasting solution to the conflict in Georgia and hope that the Geneva talks will yield positive results.  In addition to participating in the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus operation on a long-term basis  Slovakia has been actively engaged for more than 20 years in the confidence-building process between the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot political leaders  and we are committed to continuing our active engagement. A combination of military and development aid activities characterizes our long-term active engagement in Afghanistan. Slovakia  as a member of the International Security Assistance Force operation  is helping to establish a secure and stable environment in Afghanistan.  In conclusion  Slovakia hopes that the last year of the first decade of this millennium will bring all the States of the international community closer together in order to overcome the negative consequences of the financial and economic crisis  among others.  This represents a basic step towards the possible settlement of many other conflicts and problems that the international community is facing. In our view  we have to intensify our efforts  in this regard  and adopt appropriate measures on the local  regional and global levels in the spirit of solidarity and common responsibility. We strongly believe that the United Nations and its specialized agencies must be directly engaged in this process and guide the world for the welfare of this generation and of those of the future.  I should like once again to reaffirm Slovakia’s support for your work  which  through pursuing the priorities of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session  will address the main ills that pain the international community today.

"161",6510,"SVN",64,2009,"Yesterday and today we have heard many inspiring words. We heard powerful words  words of hope. A few moments ago we heard words about salvation. Although most of us would not agree that salvation is around the corner  at the same time I believe all of us will agree that improvement is possible and that the reason we are here is to make that improvement a reality. But in order to do that  we must do what the peoples of the world legitimately expect from us as representatives of United Nations Member States: to make this institution  the United Nations  effective and to work for it with a sense of common purpose  truly as united nations.   I express full confidence in your experience and wisdom  Mr. President  congratulate you on your election and wish you every success in your work for the improvement of humankind’s situation.  At the same time  I would not wish to miss the opportunity to thank the President of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session  Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann  who guided this Assembly with great determination and an ethical commitment to fairness and justice.  I also wish to pay tribute to our Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  for his guidance in these trying times.  In the past few days  many of us were engaged in an effort  spearheaded by the Secretary-General  to generate the necessary political will to seal the deal in Copenhagen. We all appreciate this example of international leadership. Humankind must take resolute steps towards a new and effective system to mitigate the effects of global warming and to ensure our necessary adaptation.   Our responsibilities are common and differentiated. Today  we understand that each of the Member States of the United Nations must do its share and that  together as united nations  we can save the planet. Let the Copenhagen Conference be the turning point.  We also need to broaden the front and fully include civil society and the business sector in broad action for this needed technological and social transformation. Action starting now to mitigate the consequences of climate change will have to lead to profound societal change — a change in the way we produce  the way we consume and the way we live. Let us not be afraid of these changes. These changes may not amount to a revolution  of which President Chávez Frías of Venezuela spoke  but they will have to be real and  if guided in a wise and timely manner  they can improve our common future.  Now the world needs a comprehensive strategy in order to fulfil this task. Such a strategy needs to address all the main challenges of our time in a consistent manner. The food crisis  climate change  the energy crisis  the spreading of infectious diseases and other problems may have different roots  but they produce a single  communicative effect. They hobble global development and make the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals only a distant possibility. Therefore  clear responses are called for.   And what is the role of the United Nations in this context? Some of the answers have already been provided. They are enshrined  inter alia  in the Outcome of the United Nations Conference on the World Financial and Economic Crisis and its Impact on Development  which was held in New York in June. Results of that Conference should be further elaborated. Specific priority tasks for global development must soon be defined.  These days  many expectations are linked to the G-20 summit meeting in Pittsburgh. Much needs to be done to bring greater discipline and responsibility to the global financial system. This is an important and immediate priority. Moreover  it is necessary to increase resources and to adjust the Bretton Woods institutions with a view to the proper maintenance of global financial stability and of development financing. The restarting of global trade negotiations has become an urgent priority.  But even more is needed  including the improvement of official development assistance  with a    09-52425 10  particular priority on development in Africa. Issues of global development represent a large part of the agenda of the current session of the General Assembly.  However  we must also think about the fate of human rights in current global circumstances. Human rights and development are closely connected. The current recession has already increased global levels of poverty. Unemployment is growing. The faith of many young people is becoming ever more uncertain. All these are serious challenges to global social stability and may turn into the serious security concerns of tomorrow if left unattended.  I welcome the efforts of the International Labour Organization and the Global Jobs Pact adopted in June. Today  there is no challenge to human rights more pervasive  more strategic and more pressing than the challenge of poverty and unemployment. Policymakers need to ensure that economic policies and human rights policies alike are coordinated and that mechanisms are put into place at the national and international levels.  Slovenia was one of the first Member States to sign today the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic  Social and Cultural Rights. The Protocol will give individuals an additional and potentially significant implementation mechanism. This is a small step  but one which demonstrates our awareness of the problem and our commitment to action.  We are also looking to the Human Rights Council as the main body of the United Nations to devise strategies for human rights. Slovenia has been an active member of the Council and we remain optimistic. The progress achieved so far in developing new methods of work in the Council is encouraging  albeit not yet sufficient. We welcome the election of the United States to the Council and believe that only an inclusive forum for human rights can be an effective forum for human rights. Members of the Human Rights Council must realize that they bear a special responsibility to lead.  But there are problems which exceed the potential of the Human Rights Council itself. The failures to protect human beings from mass atrocities and from gross and systematic violations of human rights should not be repeated. We still have not found the right tools to respond in a timely and effective manner to such situations. I therefore welcome the debate on the responsibility to protect that took place in the General Assembly in July this year. Continued engagement of the General Assembly on this subject has proved to be necessary  and I hope that this discussion will yield results.  Issues of environment  development and human rights represent today the bulk of the current United Nations agenda  but it is in the area of the maintenance of international peace and security that some of the most urgent thinking and action are necessary. Four areas of work are of special importance.  The reform of the Security Council is long overdue and progress made at the sixty-third session of the General Assembly is insufficient. However  negotiations so far have generated a positive momentum. It is apparent that the expansion of the Security Council in the permanent and non-permanent categories of membership has gained broad support among United Nations Member States. Exactly a year ago from this rostrum  I suggested a specific model for Security Council expansion. It was one of many proposals that were made. Now the time is right for that and other proposals to be put on the table and to be addressed head on.  In addition to structural change  such as Security Council reform  we need to strengthen the United Nations practical role in the maintenance of international peace and security. I welcome the thinking expressed in the report of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations entitled “A New Partnership Agenda: Charting a New Horizon for United Nations Peacekeeping”  published in July this year. The report highlights many of the most pressing and subtle needs for improvement. Member States must give careful consideration to the report and to such concepts as expanding the peacekeeping partnership  the purpose of which is to strengthen the operational capacity and political sophistication of United Nations peacekeeping.  Let us not overlook the fact that progress in peacekeeping would strengthen all other United Nations activities linked to the maintenance of international peace and security  including preventive diplomacy and post-conflict peacebuilding.  The third area which needs to be addressed is disarmament  non-proliferation and arms control  where we have come up against far too many stumbling blocks in the past. United Nations action needs to be energized now  and the forthcoming review   11 09-52425  of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons has to be a step forward.   Fourthly  the United Nations will continue to be an indispensable forum for political consultation and policy advice. The experience of the United Nations is irreplaceable. The situation in Afghanistan can be cited as a case in point. For three decades now  the United Nations has been seized with a variety of problems affecting Afghanistan  a Member State. No one should doubt that Afghanistan belongs to the Afghans or that the Afghanization of security is the only real path towards security in the country. There can be no military solution to the country’s variety of problems. It is becoming ever more apparent that the international community will have to assist in an Afghan process of transition that will decrease and eventually phase out the international military presence in the country.  Let me emphasize the role of the United Nations in that context. Sometimes  matters such as the situation in and around Afghanistan are discussed at specialized international conferences  but wisdom and common sense suggest that the experience of the United Nations be put to use. Let us not forget the unique success of the United Nations  of the United Nations-led 2001 Bonn Conference and of the subsequent Constitutional Loya Jirga. The time has come for a broad look at the entire experience since that period  an assessment of what exactly went wrong and why  a sober assessment of the current situation  and the careful definition of further steps that will make international political  economic and administrative assistance more effective and the international military presence no longer needed. The assistance of the Security Council and the General Assembly will be valuable in that regard.   Let me conclude by saying something very obvious. The agenda of the United Nations today is heavy  but that is not news. The United Nations has always been the forum for addressing the world’s most intractable problems. At the same time  however  the United Nations has always represented hope and promise to the world. Let us live up to that hope and that promise. Let us make this the era of the United Nations and the Organization’s finest hour. "
"162",6555,"SWE",64,2009,"In the beginning  there were 51 nations committed to international peace and security  sharing the common goal of developing friendly relations among nations  and promoting social progress  better living standards and human rights. Today  the 51 nations of the first session of the General Assembly have become 192. Today  the General Assembly really is the town hall meeting of the world.  On behalf of the 27 States members of the European Union (EU)  I bring a message of cooperation and partnership — a message that our Union is open to the outside world.   Globalization is good. Through globalization  hundreds of millions of people have been lifted out of poverty; information  ideas and inventions shared; goods and services provided. It all moves quickly from one country to another. We prosper from this. It enlightens us. It helps us to understand the ways of other parts of the world.  At the same time  globalization means that one nation’s problems will also come knocking at the doors of other nations. Pandemics  food crises  organized crime  trafficking in drugs and humans  terrorism and violent ideologies are no longer limited by borders and no longer only one nation’s problem. And so  we have to manage the risks and threats that follow.  In this work  we need the United Nations broad-based legitimacy for international actions and norms to coordinate our efforts. And the United Nations  for its part  has to adapt in order to stay relevant and to be able to address the issues before us. The European Union wishes to contribute to these efforts.  We welcome the declared wish of the United States to work together with others in multilateral institutions. This opens the door to a promising new era in international cooperation.  We are facing one of the biggest challenges of our generation. Our world has a fever  and the fever is rising. In the most vulnerable of the world’s nations  the consequences of climate change will be alarming. Starvation  severe flooding and climate migration will be a reality even if we keep to the two-degree target set by the United Nations.  No doubt  developed countries will have to lead the fight against climate change. By 2020  we will have to reduce emissions by 25 to 40 per cent from 1990 levels. But if emissions are to peak by no later than 2020  to be reduced by at least 50 per cent by 2050 and to continue to decline thereafter  our efforts alone will not be enough. The developing countries need our help. They need our help to pay the bill that we  through our emissions  have contributed to.  That is why the European Union last week agreed to start discussions on how much climate financing is needed in developing countries. That is why we are taking concrete steps. That is why we are putting one more brick into the negotiations  and urge other developed countries to do the same.  At the meeting of the leaders of the G-8 and the Major Economies Forum in Italy this summer  there was agreement on the two-degree target. Now  we need to see increased commitment and concrete mid-term targets from developed as well as developing countries. If we want our children and their children to experience nature as we know it  we must act now. And every nation or group of nations has to do its part.  The EU is willing to do its part. We will reduce our emissions. We will promote low carbon growth  contribute our fair share of financing and support adaptation worldwide. And we will remain committed to playing a lead role in bringing about a global and comprehensive climate agreement in Copenhagen in December.  What started out as the pursuit of easy money  unhealthy risk-taking and  in some cases  pure greed    09-52179 48  escalated this past year into a financial roller coaster. The effects on both human security and development have been severe. The European Union will continue to promote global financial stability and sustainable world recovery  firmly committed to taking comprehensive  targeted and coordinated action to support developing countries  especially the poorest and the most vulnerable; determined to reach a comprehensive agreement at the Doha Round  making sure it contains elements of real value for developing countries  particularly the poorest; and continuing its efforts to lift more people out of poverty in reaching the Millennium Development Goals and to achieve our respective official development assistance targets.  Human rights are universal. Human rights are indivisible. The European Union is a voice for human rights. We believe in democracy. We believe in the rule of law. The European Union will continue to call for the worldwide abolition of the death penalty in all cases and under all circumstances. We will continue to stand up for the empowerment of women and gender equality. Without that  it will be impossible to draw on all those talents that are needed for a nation to move from poverty to development and prosperity.  To uphold those fundamental values  we need security. We cannot let war crimes  genocide or crimes against humanity go unpunished. Therefore  the work of the International Criminal Court is fully supported by the European Union. We cannot allow anyone  by threat or use of force  to act against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State. The rules of international law apply equally to all States  large and small.  The European Union stands ready to continue working with the United Nations in peacekeeping and peacebuilding. We also conduct our own peacekeeping efforts  often in close cooperation with the United Nations. The transfers of responsibilities in Chad and in Kosovo are examples of that.  Twenty years after the end of the cold war  peace and security are still threatened by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and by the fact that those weapons risk falling into the wrong hands. We strongly urge the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to renounce nuclear weapons  and we stand ready to engage in that matter. We also welcome the global nuclear security summit that will take place next year.  Europe and Africa are close in geography  but also through globalization and strong partnership. The European Union provides support to Africa when needed. Our naval operation Atalanta  off the coast of Somalia  protects vessels delivering humanitarian aid and provides support to the African Union Mission in Somalia. We have for many years cooperated with the United Nations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  We speak out on injustice on the African continent. The use of sexual violence as a weapon of intimidation and terror is appalling. The attacks on women and girls in eastern Congo and other places are unacceptable. To protect we must empower; and so  to empower women in conflict situations  Security Council resolutions 1325 (2000) and 1820 (2008) have to be implemented.  We wish to see a free  democratic and prosperous Africa. That is especially true in the case of Zimbabwe. The Global Political Agreement and the formation of the Government of National Unity were important steps forward. However  implementing the Agreement requires commitment. It requires a spirit of cooperation. In that regard  much remains to be done.  Europe is a union of many cultures. Our openness to the world around us is evident in the fact that Christians  Jews and Muslims  those who believe in God and those who do not  can live side by side in mutual respect. The European Union wishes to enhance its interaction with the Muslim world through the Alliance of Civilizations and through cooperation in education and development by providing opportunities for the young. In that way  we can create an environment that will allow us to focus on what we have in common rather than on our perceived differences.  Afghan children show the same curiosity as children all over the world  including my own  longing for knowledge  wanting to take part and full of excitement over what life has to offer. In order to invest in the future of Afghanistan and in human development  we cannot let their light be shut out. As a friend of the people of Afghanistan  the European Union is committed to assisting them in stabilizing  democratizing and developing their country. Education  also for young girls and women  is indispensable. In the years ahead  we need to do more to ensure that this is the way forward for Afghanistan.   49 09-52179   As a partner of Pakistan  we know that what happens in Pakistan influences not only the Pakistanis  but the development of the region as a whole. Therefore  it is crucial to continue to assist Pakistan in its efforts to develop the rule of law and to build a more stable and more democratic society.  As a friend of the people of Israel  we tell the Israeli Government to reach out for peace  to end occupation  to respect international law  to work for a two-State solution  to immediately end all settlement activities on occupied land  including East Jerusalem  and to end the isolation of Gaza.  As a friend of the Palestinians  we expect them to stop all violent acts against Israel  to continue to build viable State institutions and to develop democracy and the rule of law. We will continue both to provide financial support to the Palestinian Authority and to assist in capacity-building on the ground. In that regard  the European Union fully supports the United States efforts to resume peace negotiations and to stand ready to actively contribute to their success. The future of both Israel and Palestine lies in that cooperation.  As a friend of the people of Iran  we are concerned about the deteriorating human rights situation and the violent crackdown on popular protests. The Iranian nuclear issue represents a major challenge to international peace and security  to regional stability and to the non-proliferation regime. Iran must regain the trust of the international community  comply with relevant Security Council resolutions and contribute to peace in the Middle East.  As a friend of the people of Burma/Myanmar  we will tell the military leaders that only democracy and human rights can bring peace and stability to the people that they say they represent.  The Swedish statesman and former United Nations Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld once said that the pursuit of peace and progress  with its trials and its errors  its successes and its setbacks  can never be relaxed and never abandoned. That was true then and it is true today. The people of the world need to know that uniting nations is a work not of the past  but of the future  carried forward by shared values and by mutual respect and ever more relevant with increased globalization.   In that common endeavour  the European Union will remain a reliable partner on security  development and human rights  always contributing actively to improving and strengthening the United Nations  always continuing to refine the instruments needed to deal with opportunities and threats alike  and always willing to do its part in helping to create a better world to live in for future generations  everywhere."
"163",6593,"SWZ",64,2009,"It is a pleasure for me to address the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. Our coming here as leaders gives us the opportunity to debate global challenges as per our objectives and goals as enshrined in the United Nations Charter.  The United Nations is a forum where we all come together to share ideas  review progress and come up with strategies to deal with world issues that need our attention and input. The founders of this Organization had a noble idea of addressing world issues amicably with a view to avoiding confrontation. Therefore  we are supposed to meet as equal partners to debate issues that affect us as the world community  in a forum where we are guided by the principles of trust  respect and natural justice. The aim of the United Nations is to bring joy and peace to the nations of the world. Let us make sure that people develop confidence in the United Nations so that they can approach the Organization when they have problems.  We note that Africa has multiple problems that seriously hinder its progress in the areas of health  the economy  poverty and social welfare  which all come under the Millennium Development Goals. It is our aim as the African continent to evolve from being third world countries to a first world status. That calls on us — Africa in general and Swaziland in particular — to work harder and smarter in order to realize that goal and generate a strong economy for the betterment of the lives of all our peoples.  However  we realize that we cannot effectively deal with the challenges confronting us alone  mainly because our resources are limited. It is through the United Nations that we continue to forge partnerships with different countries so that we work together to grow our economies. We appeal to the developed nations to recognize our hard work and to increase our access to soft loans and grants to support development programmes and poverty-reduction strategies. We call on the United Nations to continue supporting national initiatives aimed at eventually transforming our economies to first world economies.  However  the global financial and economic crisis has made the situation difficult  especially for developing countries. It restrains us from achieving the Millennium Development Goals.  The secondary effects of the crisis are now hitting hard on developing economies  like that of the    09-52470 10  Kingdom of Swaziland  whose export trade is largely dependent on performance in developed global markets. In our case  several Government interventions have been undertaken to rescue sectors such as the pulp and textile industries. Added to this is the need to mobilize resources and promote financial inclusion in order to stimulate economic growth at the grassroots level. In that regard  financial inclusion remains an important stimulus for poverty alleviation programmes in developing countries like the Kingdom of Swaziland.   We are encouraged by signs of recovery from the crisis  and we are confident that the United Nations will continue to play its leading role in the efforts to find a speedy resolution to the situation so that we may all focus on development issues for the benefit of all our peoples.  It is most unfortunate that while we do our level best to improve our economies  we continue to be confronted by disturbances and conflicts that include wars and coups. We condemn those acts  as they lead to untold suffering for millions of our peoples. As nations of the world  let us come together and make sure that such acts are not supported or encouraged. We call upon all nations of the world to isolate and discourage the sympathizers and sponsors. Where there are problems  the peoples of the world must know that they can address the challenges that they encounter through peaceful engagement and dialogue.   If we want to achieve peace in the world  it is important that we reduce and eventually eradicate nuclear arms  which pose a threat to our planet. We need to encourage nations that are at the stage of developing  and those that already possess  nuclear capability to utilize it for power generation that supports and stimulates economic growth. Therefore  we encourage the International Atomic Energy Agency to continue to monitor countries that are developing nuclear arms so that they may be stopped. It must also ensure that countries that already have nuclear capability reduce and eventually eradicate their nuclear arms so that they become a thing of the past. In order to accelerate the eradication of nuclear arms  the United Nations must set targets and timelines for compliance.  Another issue of concern is the continuing delay of the reform of the Security Council. Many nations have come to the conclusion that the Council membership needs to be expanded so that it is more representative  so that its decisions may be owned by all Member States.  Africa has adopted firm and clear resolutions on the Council composition they would like to see. Those decisions were further affirmed at the recent summit of the Non-Aligned Movement. Regrettably  we still have not seen meaningful progress on that matter. We therefore would like to call on all members of the Security Council to address that issue with the urgency that it deserves.  We are encouraged by the call made by fellow leaders for us to open a new page in the work of the United Nations by approaching global matters collectively. It is imperative that the United Nations take the lead in all issues that affect mankind. The reform of the Security Council is one such area that could clearly demonstrate the new approach to issues.  The Kingdom of Swaziland reiterates its support for the efforts deployed by the international community under the auspices of the United Nations towards a political solution to the issue of Western Sahara. We reaffirm that the initiative by the Kingdom of Morocco for considerable autonomy for Western Sahara is the beginning of a realistic and credible move. The Kingdom of Swaziland calls upon all parties to join the process in order to implement Security Council resolutions 1813 (2008) and 1871 (2009).   The Kingdom of Swaziland continues to support efforts to bring lasting peace to the situation in the Darfur region  Somalia  Madagascar and other parts of our continent.   I take this opportunity to express my appreciation for the support and assistance being extended to the Inclusive Government and the people of the Republic of Zimbabwe by the nations of the world and by international organizations. I also wish to echo the call and appeal of the Southern African Development Community for the immediate removal of all sanctions against Zimbabwe  in order to ensure the speedy recovery of the economy of that country for the benefit of its long-suffering people.  As we gather here  we also wait with anticipation for the outcome of the Israeli and Palestinian peace efforts. We have seen the two parties enter into promising peace agreements in the past that  regrettably  faltered along the way. We call upon the   11 09-52470  two parties to continue to pursue peace to avoid loss of life and to live in harmony.  We are happy to acknowledge the improvements in the relations between the Republic of China on Taiwan and the People’s Republic of China. That new development has resulted in the international community responding positively to the request of Taiwan to be involved in United Nations agencies  as evidenced by the granting of observer status in the World Health Assembly. We look forward to seeing Taiwan being allowed to fully contribute to humanity by being given adequate participation in other United Nations specialized agencies.  It is encouraging that this year’s General Assembly was preceded by the Summit on Climate Change  where issues of environmental protection were given priority  as they are critical to all our development strategies. The Summit noted that some developed countries pollute the environment  mainly through gas emissions  despite all the protocols in place to protect it.  I am confident that the Summit was able to mobilize adequate political support to guide the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  to be held in Copenhagen in December  where developed countries will be able to share their experiences and the challenges that they faced. This will inform the agenda that will lead to the transfer of skills and technology so that  as developing countries pursue their growth  they can avoid the mistakes of the past.   We cannot overemphasize the need to protect the environment  as it is a precious gift from God to humanity and must be preserved for generations to come. We support the call for the establishment of a major fund to cater to all projects related to climate change. We are hopeful that Copenhagen will come up with solutions for funding climate-change projects that will be predictable  accessible and incremental. The Kingdom of Swaziland is determined to work harder to meet the targets set by the United Nations.  In conclusion let me say that the Kingdom of Swaziland appreciates the good work of the United Nations and its related agencies  which remain the only hope for overcoming the many complex challenges facing the world today. We therefore take pride in reaffirming our commitment to the principles and ideals contained in the United Nations Charter."
"164",6622,"SYC",64,2009,"On behalf of President James Michel of Seychelles  leader of one of the smallest nations of this Assembly  I congratulate you  Sir  on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session.   33 09-53165   With a population of just over 85 000  we are painfully aware of our vulnerability as a nation at the mercy of the ebb and flow of global tides. Our vulnerability is all the more acute in this age marked by economic and other crises and the increasingly destructive effects of climate change. However  precisely because of that  our citizens are aware of our responsibility as a nation within the community of nations. We are aware that the solutions to our problems do not lie solely within our borders. As an assembly of nations  we must take into account more than ever the responsibility that we have and that we share. That is our responsibility to our peoples and to humanity as a whole.   The international community has not shirked that responsibility in the face of the world financial crisis  for example  as every nation has had to react in one way or another. In Seychelles  our inherent vulnerabilities and economic imbalances  which had accumulated over time  meant that we had to act earlier than many other States to face up to the crisis. We entered into a Standby Arrangement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and are also discussing debt rescheduling through the Paris Club.  The process has been difficult for every Seychellois  but we are seeing the results  and our nation is emerging stronger and more resilient. We still have a long way to go  but we  and our multilateral and bilateral partners  have all been surprised at how quickly we have emerged and managed to improve our economic situation. The process has also marked a milestone in the relationship between multilateral financial institutions and a small island developing State. It has proved to us that  although the voices of the smaller States are often drowned in the tumult of the international arena  the instruments of the global economy can be adapted to meet the needs of a smaller partner.  Our specificities and vulnerabilities have been recognized throughout the discussions with our multilateral and bilateral partners. Seychelles would like to salute the role played by the IMF  the World Bank and the African Development Bank in that process. We would also like to express our appreciation to our bilateral partners and other organizations that have supported us in one way or another in facing up to the crisis. It is an example of a responsibility shared. Through shared responsibility  a crisis can be contained. Through shared responsibility  what appeared to be impossible has become achievable.  It is our duty in this Assembly to use the principle of shared responsibility in solving our global problems  especially in offering solidarity and assistance to those States in need of outside support. We have all heard how the unrest in Somalia has spilled beyond its borders to manifest itself as piracy on the high seas. Seychelles is one of the States directly affected and heavily impacted by that scourge  as pirates prey on shipping and lay siege to the yachting  tourism and fishing industries of the Western Indian Ocean.  The long-term effects are much broader: as insurance premiums for shipping increase  the cost of transporting essential goods rises correspondingly. Also  we have often seen that economic desperation  coupled with long-term political instability  can lead to a breeding ground for terrorism.  Seychelles is pleased to note the increasing engagement of many States in the fight against piracy in the Indian Ocean. We share the responsibility to ensure peace and stability in the region; as always  this is the prerequisite for progress. We must take action in three areas to effectively tackle the piracy situation. The root cause of the problem lies within Somalia. The long-term solution lies in establishing peace  stability  progress and the rule of law within Somalia. Through enhanced coordination and the sharing of information  we must ensure that piracy is not economically viable. We must share information to ensure that  by keeping vessels beyond their reach  we are always ahead of the pirates.  We must ensure that there is enough deterrence in terms of military assets in the region. Seychelles alone has an exclusive economic zone of 1.4 million square kilometres to patrol and protect  which we would not be able to do effectively without the help of friendly countries.  Nowhere is our shared responsibility more needed than in protecting and nurturing our shared environment. For the small island developing States (SIDS)  the preservation of our environment is about our safety  our security  our economy and  ultimately  our survival. Thus  the battle against climate change is for a battle for our survival. Small island States and other particularly vulnerable nations  such as the least developed countries  cannot look at that issue in any other way.   09-53165 34   The fight against climate change is a fight based on our undeniable human right to exist not only as nation States  but as peoples and communities. For example  the Arctic peoples and other indigenous peoples are also suffering from climate change first hand. Their voices  just like those of us in the SIDS and other particularly vulnerable States  need to be heard by the world’ s leaders.  Nothing is more critical to our survival as States  as nations  as peoples and as communities than an urgent  coherent and effective response to the effects of climate change. But the response thus far has been sorely lacking. Weeks before Copenhagen  we are still unsure as to what type of an agreement we will get there. Furthermore  there are indications that if an agreement is made  it will not suffice to save many island States.  As the last small island developing State to speak in this general debate  Seychelles therefore feels it has a duty to remind the international community that in the coming weeks before Copenhagen  the Alliance of Small Island States will continue to steadfastly call for that which is necessary to our survival. That includes stabilizing long-term atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations at well below 350 parts per million; ensuring that average global surface temperature increases be limited to well below 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels; and requiring global greenhouse gas emissions to peak by 2015 and decline significantly thereafter. Furthermore  greenhouse gas emissions should be reduced by more than 85 per cent by 2050. Annex 1 greenhouse gas emissions should be reduced by at least 45 per cent by 2020 and by 2050  at least 95 per cent of 1990 carbon dioxide levels should be reduced. Non-Annex 1 emissions should also demonstrate significant deviations from baseline over comparable time periods.  Before concluding  Seychelles must salute the United Nations for the body of work it has contributed to advancing our understanding of how climate change is damaging our planet. Seychelles also thanks Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his leadership in ensuring that climate change  and especially the plight of the particularly vulnerable such as the small island developing States  get the attention they deserve.  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has shown us that climate change is a disaster very much in the making. It is a disaster which  unlike previous global disasters  is not occurring in one sudden instant  but rather is gaining in pace and destructive power over time. It is also a disaster which is man-made  which is to say that it is our fault. As such  it is a disaster that we have a duty and a responsibility to prevent and that we can prevent.  We cannot afford to leave any nation behind in Copenhagen  no matter how poor  how weak or how small. Once again  this is our shared responsibility that we must assume."
"165",6668,"SYR",64,2009,"Allow me to congratulate the fraternal Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and you personally  Mr. President  on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at this session. I wish you success in your endeavours  and succeed you will  given your vast experience and competence.   I also extend our deep appreciation to your predecessor  Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann  for successfully steering the work of the sixty-third session; I recognize his positive stand vis-à-vis the fundamental issues with which the international community is seized. I also wish the Secretary-General every success in his undertakings as he seeks to fulfil the purposes and principles of our international Organization.  We come here every year and stress from this very rostrum  as do many others  that the Middle East is one of the most tense regions of the world and that the situation is extremely ominous. From this very rostrum  most speakers stress that a just and comprehensive peace is an urgent requirement for the realization of the interests of all parties in the region and the world at large. However  paying lip service to the need for peace is obviously different from working for peace. Actions inside and outside the region have spoken louder than words  and peace has remained elusive for years.   During that time  Israel waged two devastating wars against Lebanon and Gaza. It had no qualms about committing internationally prohibited acts or breaching international law  encouraged and protected by the Administration of former United States President Bush. To date  Israel continues to impose a stifling siege on Gaza  in contravention of the most basic humanitarian principles and tenets of international humanitarian law. These facts have been confirmed by many investigations  and were most recently published in the report of the United Nations Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict. The head of the Mission concluded that Israel had committed grave violations of human rights law  and international humanitarian law  including war crimes and possibly crimes against humanity.  The international approach to the Middle East question has changed in previous years. Addressing this issue has become a priority  and has been followed by immediate action on the ground. This is certainly reassuring. It is our sincere hope that these efforts will bear fruit. But the engagement by the new United States Administration  the members of the Security Council  the European Union  the Organization for the Islamic Conference and the Non-Aligned Movement has been continuously confronted with Israeli measures and positions that ignore the most basic underpinnings of the peace process. Israel defies the policies of its friends and allies and undermines their will. Israel also challenges the will of the overwhelming majority — if not the entirety — of the international community. Perhaps more than ever before  Israel has now revealed its true colours: an entity that has enshrined racism  aggression and tension-building while balking at peace and repudiating the advocates of peace.  Israel refuses to freeze illegitimate settlement building and is thus in breach of its obligations under international law. Israel continues to confiscate Palestinian land  build the apartheid wall  Judaize Jerusalem  expel inhabitants from their homes and bring in settlers to replace them. This list is in no way exhaustive. These facts are substantiated by figures but  in the interest of time  we shall not dwell on them in detail. Suffice it to say that the two-State solution advocated by the international community has been rejected by the Israeli Government. The Israeli Prime Minister’s comments on the subject are sheer tactical manoeuvres that are contradicted entirely by the policies pursued by his Government on the ground.  President Bashar Al-Assad has said that peace is antithetical to occupation. Peace and occupation cannot coexist. He stressed that we in Syria seek a just and comprehensive peace and that peace is our strategic choice. It is a choice based on the implementation of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)  the Madrid terms of reference  the principle of land for peace and the Arab Peace Initiative. We have supported every effort aimed at achieving this goal. To that end  we entered into indirect talks with Israel through Turkish mediation and sought to arrive at common ground that would ultimately enable us to launch direct negotiations. But the absence of genuine political will to make peace and the war of aggression that the Israeli Government waged against Gaza brought this pursuit to a halt.   25 09-52598   In full view of the world and in defiance of its unanimous will  Israel has chosen to be a rejectionist State. It has chosen to challenge the international community. This is a dangerous position and a stance that threatens peace and security in the region. The continued occupation  the Judaization of Jerusalem  the intensification of settlement activities and the racist slogans presage serious consequences for the world. The world must not succumb to the dictates of Israeli extremists. It must not allow Israel to persist in its violation of international law and its defiance of international will and decisions.  Brotherly Iraq continues to bleed. The situation in Iraq is a cause for serious concern to us as a neighbouring Arab country. We have continuously stressed the urgency of preserving the unity of Iraq’s territory and people while guaranteeing its sovereignty and safeguarding its independence and its Arab-Islamic identity. To that end  it is urgent to build Iraqi national unity on the basis of national reconciliation  which must include Iraqis of all stripes. Iraqi national unity is the cornerstone of the reconciliation process  but it will remain elusive unless the necessary conditions for national reconciliation are achieved.  We have continuously condemned all aggressive acts that claim the lives of innocent victims in Iraq. We have also repeatedly called for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Iraq and for the restoration of full Iraqi independence and sovereignty. We have stressed our readiness to facilitate that withdrawal by extending our cooperation in maintaining security in Iraq. It is our hope that Iraqis will soon be able to arrive  through constructive dialogue  at solutions that firmly support Iraq’s unity  strength and prosperity while remaining fully dedicated and loyal to the unity of the land of Iraq and its people.  Syria has been dedicated to strengthening bilateral Syrian-Iraqi relations in all their aspects. We established a bilateral council for strategic cooperation in various fields. We were distressed by the recent “Bloody Wednesday” terrorist bombings in Baghdad  which we strongly condemn. But we were surprised to hear  days later  accusations levelled at us — accusations devoid of any truth — implying that we harboured those suspected of masterminding those bombings. These claims and the ensuing developments are extremely unfortunate and cannot serve the interests of Iraq or Syria.  We are open to suggestions on how to solve the current crisis by demanding that real evidence be made available to substantiate those claims. This has not yet been done. We stress that protecting the Iraqi people and safeguarding their interests is one of our priorities. We are also keen to safeguard the fraternal relations between the Iraqi and Syrian peoples and express our satisfaction at the current efforts of Turkey and the Secretary-General of the League of Arab States.  We have followed with grave concern the recent developments in Yemen. We hope that security will ultimately prevail. We support Yemen’s unity  stability and the prosperity of its people.  Attempts to undermine the Sudan’s unity and to compromise its security and sovereignty are also a cause of concern for us. We fully support the Sudan and its leadership and stress the need to create favourable conditions conducive to a settlement of all pending issues. In that regard  we appreciate the efforts made by the State of Qatar in cooperation with the League of Arab States and the African Union.  Another cause for concern is the events unfolding in Somalia  a country already afflicted by war and internal strife. We call on our brothers there to work for national reconciliation and to use dialogue as a means of settling their differences. We urge them to work towards the unity of Somalia  which as the supreme national interest should take precedence over any other consideration  and to lay the foundations for security and stability in their country.  We support the efforts of the African Union to settle the existing conflicts that continue to plague some parts of the African continent  to achieve development in the countries of Africa and to promote the African role in the international system.  We also renew our call for the lifting of the blockade imposed on Cuba for more than half a century.  For years  Syria has been calling for the establishment of a zone free of all weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East region. To this end  Syria tabled a draft resolution before the Security Council in 2003 calling for the establishment of such a zone. Today Syria stresses the need for Israel to commit to complying with the resolution of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) adopted on 18 September of this year regarding Israeli nuclear    09-52598 26  capabilities (GC(53)/RES/17)  in which the Agency called upon Israel to place its nuclear facilities under comprehensive IAEA safeguards and to accede to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). We recall once again the right of all States to acquire nuclear technology for peaceful purposes  as guaranteed by the NPT. We fully support constructive dialogue as a means to settle all differences.  The world is still reeling from a crippling economic and financial crisis that has adversely affected the economic and social conditions of most countries of the world. Very few countries  if any  have been spared its devastating effects. This crisis led many to question its root causes  shedding light on the deficiencies in the financial system and its practices and thus highlighting the sound practices that could have prevented the crisis. The world cannot deal with the crisis as a fait accompli. We must seek answers and outcomes that endorse sound practices and remedy systemic imbalances that are bound to affect us all in the globalized world in which we live. Our common goal is to establish a more secure economic and financial world order.  It goes without saying that the countries of the South have disparate economies and are comparatively more disadvantaged and adversely affected by the current crisis than those of the North. The world’s poor end up paying a higher price for a breakdown that is not of their making. Rich States are therefore duty bound to provide all forms of support to poorer countries to help them overcome this crisis. Poor countries have earned this support  and any positive results that it generates will serve the interests of poor and rich countries alike. We also call for the increased participation of developing countries in the work of the Group of 20  which would enable them to put forward proposals and advance appropriate responses to overcome the crisis.  We and many others have often called for an enhanced and reinvigorated role for the United Nations in order to build a better  more just and more secure world. We believe that the present moment is auspicious. We therefore call on all Member States to work seriously to ensure compliance with the Charter of our international Organization and to introduce the necessary reforms in order to promote it  learning from the lessons of past decades and from our achievements and failures. We sincerely look forward to a world governed by respect for international law in which security  stability and prosperity reign supreme. "
"166",6713,"TCD",64,2009,"On behalf of my delegation and in my own name  I would like to offer the President our warmest congratulations on his brilliant election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. It would be remiss not to express our pride and our pleasure at the election of the representative of a neighbour country  brother and friend of Chad. I am referring to the brother Ali Treki of the great Libyan Arab Jamahiriya. With his qualities and his long and rich diplomatic experience  he will find it easy to lead our work with tact. Through me  the Chadian delegation assures him of its full cooperation in discharging his difficult but very lofty task.  I would also like to express our gratitude to his predecessor for having led the work of the sixty-third session with skill and perception. Allow me also to pay due tribute to our Secretary-General  His Excellency Ban Ki-moon  for his tireless commitment to the work of defending and promoting the ideals of our Organization.  From this rostrum  delegations at the sixty-third session deplored the food  energy and financial crises that had struck our countries  the consequences of which were felt differently according to each country’s level of development. What conclusions should we draw after a year of intense mobilization  cooperation and work to overcome those crises?  For us poor States  those crises remain genuine obstacles to achieving the Millennium Development    09-52604 18  Goals to which we all committed  in particular for the financing of our development strategies. Despite the great international mobilization  there is a risk that the poor countries will fail to meet the 2015 deadline. That is all the more worrying as the situation persists and remains the focus of international debates. The situation continues to also generate consequences that endanger the implementation of the Monterrey Consensus  in particular official development assistance  commercial trade  the debt of the countries of the South and world trade.   We cannot say it often enough: the developing countries will continue to pay dearly for an economic crisis that they did not cause. The international community must therefore urgently step up its efforts to alleviate the difficulties that those countries face.  Another major issue of concern  one no less significant  is the negative impacts of climate change on the world in general and on developing countries  in particular the most vulnerable. There too our countries are victims of a phenomenon caused by the major greenhouse gas producers  which are the industrialized countries. We feel those effects daily as the greatest disaster for our environment  our agriculture  our livestock farming — in short  for the life of our populations in the form of famines and all kinds of illnesses.  The most significant example is the risk of the complete disappearance of Lake Chad if the international community does not resolutely commit to helping us save its world heritage. In 40 years  the surface area of Lake Chad has shrunk from 25 000 to less than 3 000 square kilometres. The countries of the Lake Chad Basin Commission expect the international community to come to the support of their plan to save the lake  including by implementing the project to divert the waters of the Oubangui River in the Central African Republic to feed Lake Chad.   At the initiative of His Excellency the President of the Republic  the Head of State  Chad has committed to planting 10 million trees a year to fight desertification. That programme  which is part of the transcontinental project of the Green Great Wall initiated by the Community of Sahelo-Saharan States  needs the international community’s support.  Turning to the issue of the settlement of disputes  while we welcome the progress made here and there  that is unfortunately not the case for the situation prevailing in Darfur  which is of serious concern to my Government. Regarding the African continent  we reaffirm our support and our readiness to contribute to all joint actions of the African Union and the United Nations for the peaceful and lasting settlement of those conflicts. Indeed  we welcome the initiative recently undertaken by the Leader of the Libyan Revolution  President of the African Union  to convene in Tripoli a special meeting devoted to the consideration and settlement of conflicts in Africa.  With respect to the question of Palestine  we urge and encourage our Organization to continue with greater resolve its efforts towards backing the conclusion of a peace agreement providing for the peaceful coexistence of two sovereign States  in accordance with the principles of international law and of the United Nations Charter. This is an opportunity to welcome the commitment of the new American Administration  under the leadership of President Barack Obama  to restoring peace to that region long torn by war.  The new approach to international relations adopted by the American Administration should also lead to a new attitude towards Cuba  burdened for decades by an economic  trade and financial embargo that is no longer justified today. That is why Chad wishes the United States of America to rapidly lift the embargo  which runs counter to the new vision of the world and to the great principles championed by our Organization.   Turning now to the crisis in Darfur and our relations with the Sudan  we would again like to draw the Assembly’s attention to the seriousness of the situation  which hangs over the security of our borders and threatens regional peace and security. The repercussions of that crisis for security in the camps for refugees and displaced persons in the east of my country  for the environment  which is already vulnerable in that part of the country in particular  and  in general  for the social and economic development of my country are quite evident.  The other consequence of that crisis  and not a minor one  is the phenomenon of child soldiers  who are very often recruited against their will by the various armed groups that hold sway in the region. During its various campaigns  the Chadian national army succeeded in freeing hundreds of such children and entrusted them to UNICEF for care and reinsertion   19 09-52604  into civilian life. An inspection and awareness-raising campaign has been undertaken in varying barracks throughout the country in collaboration with UNICEF  the United Nations and a number of diplomatic missions present in N’Djamena to prevent this phenomenon and curb it where is already exists.   These are the reasons that lead Chad to cooperate closely with the United Nations and the international community to find a solution to that situation  which has lasted much too long. At the same time  this shows how wrong it is to believe that my country fuels the war in Darfur by giving support to Sudanese rebels there.  Additionally  we would like to reiterate our complete availability to cooperate with the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic and Chad (MINURCAT) for the fulfilment of its mandate in the east of our country. We condemn the delays in its full deployment in the field and the ensuing difficulties in ensuring effective security for vulnerable populations such as refugees  displaced persons and humanitarian workers. It is essential that parties involved in this Mission step up their efforts to make up for those delays  whose prolongation means daily danger for the populations that all of us must protect. We are very concerned by the uncertain future of MINURCAT  and we wonder what the national capacities might be to remedy the situation by strengthening the operations for maintaining order and security in zones covered by its mandate.  Regardless of MINURCAT’s efforts  or the efforts of my country to improve the security of camps for refugees and displaced persons  a genuine settlement of the Darfur crisis can be only political in order to enable refugees and the displaced to return to their ancestral homelands.  That is why my country welcomes all initiatives undertaken by the international community in this regard. My Government has backed  and continues to back  the Qatar process and welcomes the untiring efforts by brother-leader Muammar Al-Qadhafi to secure a political settlement of the crisis and  more recently  to relaunch the Doha process. Along the same line  we also welcome the recent American and Egyptian initiatives.  The efforts of the international community to normalize relations between our country and the Sudan are also welcome. A great many agreements have been signed by my country and the Sudan. All that remains now is to implement them.  The fact that we have welcomed refugees fleeing the war in Darfur and have facilitated actions of the international community to assist them should not be used as an alibi by our neighbour in any attempt to destabilize us.  At the national level  the Government of Chad  on the impetus provided by Mr. Idriss Deby Itno  President of the Republic  Head of State  continues political dialogue with the democratic opposition on the basis of the 13 August 2007 agreement. In this climate of shared trust we have just concluded a population census with a view to organizing free and transparent elections. A national independent electoral commission composed of representatives of the Government and the opposition has just been formed and has already started its work.  Despite repeated attacks by mercenaries and armed movements with support from abroad against our territorial integrity and the democratically elected institutions  the Government continues to advocate reconciliation and national understanding. A number of armed groups have regained legal status through implementing the Sirte Agreement of 25 October 2007. A great many others have committed themselves to this path  which we welcome.  In conclusion  I would like to express the support of my country for the appeal to this Assembly by the President of the African Union for a just and fair reform of the Security Council  a reform that would take into account the legitimate aspirations of the African continent and the evolution of the history of relations among States. "
"167",6759,"TGO",64,2009,"At the outset  allow me to convey the warm greetings of the Head of State  Government and people of Togo on the occasion of the sixty-fourth session of the General Assembly. I also wish to add that the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Togo  who unfortunately is absent from New York  asked me to read out the following statement :   “From this rostrum  where the leaders of the entire planet have expressed their views on the major questions of the time  I should in turn like to share with this Assembly the following ideas  prompted by the developments in our world over the past 12 months.    “Before performing this duty  however  I wish to convey to you  Sir  the warm congratulations of the Government and the people of Togo on your well-deserved election to the presidency of the General Assembly at this session. I can assure you of my delegation’s willingness to work with you to carry out your mandate  the success of which will do honour to Africa and in particular to your country  the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya  with which Togo maintains friendly relations of solidarity and cooperation.   “Also I wish to convey to your predecessor  Father Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann  my congratulations on his work and in particular for the commendable initiatives he undertook throughout his mandate to restore the General Assembly to its due place and role under the United Nations Charter. To His Excellency Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon  I convey our   35 09-53165  congratulations for the dynamic and pragmatic manner with which he has guided our Organization.    “I hereby forcefully reaffirm Togo’s full adherence to the ideals of peace  security and development that are at the centre of the priorities of our Organization. My country also endorses the approaches adopted by our Organization in recent years to further sustainable development by promoting peace and security and by mobilizing international solidarity in the economic  social and cultural arenas.   “Political  administrative and economic governance remains essential to the consolidation of peace and security in our countries and undoubtedly helps to speed up achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. However  no harmonious and lasting development is possible without a climate of peace and national concord. That is why the Government of Togo spares no effort to create conditions conducive to bold reforms and to lay the foundations for a new republican pact and national reconciliation. Indeed  since 2005  the Government  under the guidance of the Head of State  has worked tirelessly for a policy of openness  the promotion of democracy  the strengthening of the rule of law and the reduction of poverty. A number of reforms have been undertaken in this regard  especially in the political  constitutional  institutional and socio-economic areas.   “Politically  the Head of State has engaged in dialogue as an instrument of political consensus. This approach  based on a politics of complete openness  culminated in the signing in August 2006 of the Global Political Accord  which in turn led to the formation of a Government of national unity  facilitated by His Excellency Blaise Compaoré  President of Burkina Faso. I recall that the implementation of the Global Political Accord and the 22 commitments undertaken with the European Union led to the holding of free and democratic legislative elections in October 2007  which were welcomed unanimously by the international community. In the same spirit  a Truth  Justice and Reconciliation Commission has been set up  the members of which were appointed on 29 May 2009. Its purpose is to shed light on the political acts of violence that occurred in Togo between 1958 and 2005 in order once and for all to banish impunity from our country and to reconcile the people of Togo with their history.   “With regard to constitutional reform  significant progress has been made. In August  the National Assembly adopted a law modifying the electoral code  relaxing the eligibility conditions for presidential elections  and allowing for the establishment of a national independent electoral commission and its reconfiguration in order to adapt it to current political realities. At the same time  discussions of certain questions continue with the firm resolve of the Government to carry out the rest of the reforms on the basis of consensus  since we have made concerted action and dialogue the foundation of our political action in Togo.   “In the institutional area  we have striven to reconstitute the Constitutional Court  the National Human Rights Commission and the High Authority for Audiovisual and Communication. Similarly  the Government of Togo has established a court of audits and adopted statutes for the army  the security forces and the opposition. It has also made arrangements for the public financing of political parties and the organs of the private press.   “As concerns the judiciary  our vast modernization programme of the judicial system continues in a satisfactory manner  with a view to involving the people more closely in the administration of justice. In this regard  the Government has taken measures to guarantee citizens freedom of expression  for example  by decriminalizing press offences. Furthermore  to demonstrate its desire to respect human dignity and defend human rights  our Government submitted to the National Assembly a bill abolishing the death penalty. This law  adopted unanimously on 24 June  is the outcome of a constitutional provision that requires the State to guarantee the physical and mental integrity  life and security of all persons living on our national territory.   “The efforts undertaken by the Government in the areas of health  education and employment  particularly for young people  have also seen   09-53165 36  considerable progress. In the field of health  we have established a national health development plan for the years 2009 to 2013  at a cost of 317 billion CFA francs  reflecting the will of the Togolese Government to respond effectively to our people’s health needs. With regard to education  Togo’s educational system has suffered from the financial constraints afflicting the country for the past 15 years due to the suspension of cooperation. This situation  compounded by a high demand for education  has resulted in a decline in teaching conditions and serious structural problems. In the face of these constraints  the Government has committed to establish a sectoral education plan that will allow the country to launch a fast-track initiative in 2010 to ensure education for all.   “To put a new face on public administration and make it a genuine instrument for the reconstruction and modernization of our country  we have undertaken broad reforms that require  inter alia  the recruitment of new officials. Thus  thousands of young people have found work in the public and private sectors thanks to the creation of better production conditions for the economic and social development of the country.    “With regard to the economic sector  appropriate measures have been taken to put public finances on a sound footing  create a favourable framework for business and attract investment  particularly from abroad. In this context  I take this opportunity to once again make an urgent appeal to all our bilateral and multilateral partners  particularly the European Union and the Bretton Woods institutions  to help Togo in its efforts towards socio-economic recovery.   “In the opinion of my delegation  the development and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction represent a growing threat to international peace and security  and thus a reason for us to give these questions the highest priority. In this regard  my country welcomed the Security Council summit held on 24 September  under the presidency of the United States  on nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament. While we reaffirm that multilateralism is the fundamental principle governing our consideration of disarmament and non-proliferation  Togo hopes that the Security Council summit will lead to a new approach to this crucial question. With regard to light arms  Togo reiterates its desire to see the current session of the Assembly commit to strengthening the implementation of the project aimed at negotiating a treaty on the traffic in light arms  as has been done by the Economic Community of West African States in this area.   “Concerning terrorism  an obstacle to peace and lasting development  my country feels that it has become imperative to improve and globalize the international legal framework in order to combat this scourge  which has assumed a new form in modern times. In this regard  the completion within a reasonable time frame of negotiations on a draft comprehensive convention against international terrorism would be salutary and in the interests of all.    “Similarly  the phenomenon of drugs  and in particular the illicit traffic in drugs along the west coast of Africa  has become a true danger and a destabilizing factor for the region. In light of the scale of this scourge  it is beyond a shadow of a doubt that no country can combat or hope to put an end to it alone. Togo therefore appeals for international cooperation  and in particular for assistance from the wealthy countries and competent organizations  in eradicating this phenomenon and thereby restoring the climate of security so essential to development. For its part  in spite of its scarce resources  Togo has undertaken a relentless struggle against drug traffickers and is cooperating with its neighbours in order to contain the scourge.   “As we all know  international peace and security continue to be threatened and the stability of certain countries disturbed by conflicts  terrorism and underdevelopment  all of which are largely man-made. Indeed  in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  Chad  the Central African Republic and Darfur  where crises continue  our Organization should continue to engage in a search for solutions that will allow those countries to recover the peace and security necessary to their development.    “In Somalia  despite the initiatives undertaken in April 2009 by the international community and by the African Union in July   37 09-53165  2009 in support of security institutions and the African Union Mission in Somalia  the situation remains precarious and disturbing. That is why my country urgently appeals for other urgent measures to be taken to prevent that country from succumbing to chaos for good.   “Regarding Côte d’Ivoire  we note with satisfaction the positive evolution of the political situation in that country since the Ouagadougou Political Agreement. Consequently  we call on the stakeholders to display the political will to organize the presidential election.   “With regard to Guinea  it would seem appropriate and timely to encourage the political class to find  through dialogue and consultation  ways and means of ensuring a rapid return to constitutional order.   “As to the situation in the Niger  where the revision of the Constitution has provoked a crisis  my country hopes that the parties concerned in the Niger will strive to restore dialogue and consensus in order to maintain a climate of peace and harmony in that sister country.   “Outside the African continent  in the Middle East  a theatre of violence and desolation  an equitable and final settlement of the conflicts between the countries of this region should be found as soon as possible. To that end  the international community should encourage the various actors to find a peaceful solution to their conflicts. In this regard  my delegation reaffirms that the solution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict requires the creation of a Palestinian State living side by side with the State of Israel within secure and internationally recognized borders.    “Furthermore  my country deplores the continuing acts of terrorism that have afflicted the peoples of Afghanistan  Iraq and Pakistan and undermined the efforts of these countries to promote development. That is why we urge the international community to increase its assistance to the Governments of those countries in their fight against terrorism in order to promote peace and reconstruction.    “After two decades of economic stagnation resulting from policies of budgetary austerity imposed on developing countries  the latter are now facing new challenges from the food  financial  energy and environmental crises. In the light of this situation  it is imperative to work to mitigate the financial shock and to pursue bold policies to increase the agricultural and energy production capacities of the developing countries. At the same time  we need to consider overall structural reform of the world economic and financial system in order to prevent a resurgence of such crises.    “My country therefore welcomed the high-level Conference on the World Financial and Economic Crisis and Its Impact on Development  held from 24 to 26 June  which illustrated the need for international solidarity in the face of the crisis in order to ease the suffering of the peoples of developing countries.   “In that context  Togo welcomes the early implementation  in April 2009  of one of the pledges made at the G-20 meeting in London  concerning the establishment of the Global Trade Liquidity Programme amounting to $50 billion from 2009 to 2011  $15 billion of which are allocated to the African continent. Similarly  my country welcomes the initiative taken in March 2009 by the African Development Bank to create a special $500 million funding mechanism for African trade.   “Furthermore  my delegation is pleased that the United Nations  at the initiative of the Secretary-General  has taken the measure of the danger posed to humanity by the problem of climate change and the degradation of the environment. In this regard  the high-level meeting that took place a few days ago in this very body was an opportunity to analyse the situation and to clear the way for the Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen in December. To paraphrase a great man  we have inherited the Earth and we should not destroy it. Living creatures come and go  but the Earth remains.    “In the face of the questions that my delegation has just raised  it is imperative to intensify partnerships of all kinds if we wish to prevent a situation in which  64 years after its creation  our shared Organization should find itself still facing the same challenges. It is to be hoped  therefore  that Member States  in whose   09-53165 38  interest it is that the United Nations should be more democratic  strong and effective  should determine to give it the resources necessary to permit it to achieve the Millennium Development Goals and thereby to meet the challenges that our world faces today.” "
"168",6804,"THA",64,2009,"On behalf of the delegation of the Kingdom of Thailand  I should like to extend to you  Mr. President  our sincere congratulations on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. You may rest assured of the full support and cooperation of my delegation.  We live in one of the most challenging times in our history. As in the period before the founding of the United Nations more than 60 years ago  the world is again facing great challenges. Conflicts and tensions remain in many parts of the world; terrorists attack; poverty  disease and hunger still affect many; our supply of traditional sources of energy is dwindling; and climate change is transforming the very environment in which we all live. Added to this set of issues  the current global financial crisis makes for a future that seems bleak. But  like our forebears more than 60 years ago  we also live in hope for a better future. And a large part of this hope today rests upon the United Nations.  Despite criticism  we must never doubt the fact that the world has been better off with the United Nations than it would have been without it. I say this because overcoming the challenges we have faced and are facing demands multilateral cooperation. The United Nations has been the bedrock of such multilateral cooperation  as well as what the great poet Lord Tennyson termed a “parliament of man”. And it is this parliament of man which provides a forum in which we can meet and discuss remedies to common challenges  as well as respond to the concerns of our constituents — the citizens of the world.  In the interdependent and interconnected world  no one nation  not even the biggest and the most powerful  can go it alone. But at the same time  no single nation should be left behind in our pursuit of peace  prosperity and the protection of human rights. Just as we join hands to face common challenges  we must also extend our hand to those less fortunate  pull them towards a brighter future and give them the opportunity to enjoy the fruits of globalization.   Thailand stands ready to extend a helping hand. We stand ready to share our experiences and the lessons we have learned from our own financial crisis in 1997. We believe that our nation’s remedies to our problems can be shared and should contribute to the formulation of international remedies to common global challenges. Central to our belief is that peace  security  development and human rights are intertwined and must reinforce each other so that all three pillars are sustainable. This view is also central to the United Nations.  Thailand believes that moderation is the key to sustainability. We want to see moderation instead of excessive greed  which is the cause of the economic crisis; we want to see moderation instead of overconsumption  which is the cause of environmental degradation; and we want to see moderation instead of extremism and selfishness  which are the causes of conflicts around the world. We must therefore curb our excesses  live within our means and use our resources wisely.  This idea of moderation is an important pillar of the “sufficiency economy” philosophy of His Majesty the King. This philosophy should not be understood or misunderstood as advocating an inward-looking approach. Rather  it teaches us that economic development and modernization must be better balanced and take into account the well-being of the people and their economic  social  political and    09-52586 6  environmental needs  so that the country is resilient and protected from both external and internal shocks.  His Majesty himself has applied his philosophy in practice  initiating numerous royal projects for the betterment of his people and country. His Majesty has been rightly regarded by the international community as the “development King”. His Majesty received the United Nations Development Programme Human Development Lifetime Achievement Award in recognition of his achievements as well as of his sufficiency economy philosophy  which has gained increasing resonance worldwide. And many of His Majesty’s projects are being replicated in many parts of the world.  The recent global financial crisis has shown that sufficiency economy is not merely a philosophy  but can also be translated into concrete action. Due to the lessons learned from the 1997 Asian financial crisis  most of Thailand’s financial institutions have escaped the direct impact of the current crisis  thanks to their more prudent style of investment. Entrepreneurs have managed to weather the storm through rational decision-making and more careful risk management  two of the key principles advocated by His Majesty’s philosophy.  My Government’s socio-economic policy is guided by His Majesty’s philosophy  which has been incorporated into our national economic and social development plan. Development for us is not just about the rate of growth  but also about the quality of that growth. Not only have we boosted Government spending and investment to jumpstart the economy  but we have also set up social safety nets  made educational reform a priority and upgraded our health and welfare services.  We have prioritized investment programmes and action plan to increase strength and to provide greater economic opportunities for people at grass-roots level. We have also laid the foundation for long-term growth and competitiveness in Thailand’s various sectors  including agriculture  health care  education and tourism. In short  we have made Thailand’s development a people-centred approach and Thailand’s economy more immune from external shocks.  As the Chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)  Thailand has led regional efforts to address today’s financial crisis and to create immunity for East Asia as a whole. We are expediting the multilateralization process of the Chiang Mai Initiative  under the ASEAN+3 framework  comprising ASEAN member States  China  Japan and the Republic of Korea. The aim of this exercise is to build regional financial stability through a region-wide self-help substantive reserve pooling arrangement. This will come into effect very soon. As a region  we have also continued to liberalize trade and reject all forms of protectionism. We believe that these efforts can serve as examples for other regions to follow.  Today’s financial woes affect not only a nation’s economy but also the development and welfare of its people. This crisis exacerbates the problems that already exist  such as poverty  hunger and energy shortages. Nowhere is this more strongly felt than in the developing world  and Thailand is no exception. Although we have already attained the Millennium Development Goals in hunger and poverty alleviation  much remains to be done. Thailand understands well the challenges developing countries are facing and is prepared to share with others our experiences in managing and overcoming these challenges.  As a major agricultural economy  Thailand stands ready to contribute to the solution of the world food and energy crises. We are a major food exporter with strong experience and capability in developing alternative energy  especially biodiesel and ethanol. We aim to ensure a balance between growing energy and food crops so that both needs are sufficiently addressed.  Another pressing concern that can only be successfully tackled through global cooperation is climate change. My Government is convinced that the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is the core for international negotiations and cooperation in this area  guided by the principles of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities.  In this connection  Thailand is honoured to host the United Nations climate change talks which will take place next week in Bangkok. We will spare no effort in ensuring that this round of negotiations will make tangible progress towards a successful Copenhagen Climate Change Conference in December.  Earlier this week  the Secretary-General convened the Summit on Climate Change. We welcome the commitments expressed by major economies during the Summit  in particular in setting clear goals and   7 09-52586  targets for their action. I am also pleased to see the Group of 20 pledging itself to spare no effort to achieve a successful outcome in Copenhagen.  For its part  my Government has vigorously pursued environmentally friendly growth. That is why we have announced alternative energy as our national agenda and invested significantly to boost development in this field  including in energy crops. Moreover  one of Thailand’s hallmarks is its strong biodiversity  from which Thailand and its local communities have drawn benefits through innovative economic activities and products. While we seek to benefit fully from our rich biodiversity and natural resources  we also aim to ensure that they are sustainable  regenerated and replenished.  It is not enough to ensure that the economic needs of the people are met. Their political needs are just as important. And there is no better political system than democracy to ensure the people’s freedoms and rights. It is my Government’s clear policy to sow the seeds of sustainable democracy by strengthening our democratic institutions  engaging civil society  ensuring human rights and promoting good governance and the rule of law. Democracy is not just about majority rule  but also about respect for minority rights.  At the regional level  under Thailand’s chairmanship  ASEAN has made great strides towards making people the centre of the organization’s development  as enshrined in the ASEAN Charter. Human rights issues are now at the forefront of ASEAN’s agenda. Collectively  we have played an active role to create the ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights  which becomes active this October. We are committed to doing our utmost to ensure that that body fully lives up to expectations.  Promotion of gender equality and the empowerment of women are also important to Thailand. Besides our national effort on this matter  I am pleased to add that ASEAN is also in the process of establishing an ASEAN commission on the promotion and protection of the rights of women and children. This mechanism will play an important part in enhancing and strengthening the ASEAN human rights framework as a whole.  At the international level  Thailand is party to core international human rights conventions  and we are strongly committed to the principles enshrined in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Thailand’s candidature for a seat on the Human Rights Council for the 2010-2013 term is further testament to our commitment to enhance human rights internationally.  Thailand has consistently rendered humanitarian assistance to those in plight wherever they may be. We have steadfastly contributed to the World Food Programme. We have offered our helping hand to those in need. Our humanitarian commitment was clearly evident during Cyclone Nargis that befell Myanmar  as Thailand became the logistics hub for the massive international relief effort for that country.  Sustainable economic  political and social development is not a mere goal in itself. It ultimately ensures long-lasting peace and security. That is why ASEAN is moving towards becoming not only a political-security community but also an economic and sociocultural one by 2015. These three pillars reinforce each other. Within this political-security community  Thailand and its fellow ASEAN members are ready to enhance cooperation  from dispute settlement to conflict resolution and from peacekeeping to post-conflict peacebuilding  especially with regard to cooperation on training for emergency preparedness and humanitarian assistance. We hope that our regional efforts will help contribute to peace and security not only regionally  but also internationally.  Thailand itself has played a significant role in peacekeeping operations worldwide. In the past two decades  Thailand has provided nearly 20 000 military troops  police officers and civilian staff in support of United Nations peacekeeping missions on all continents around the globe  including Cambodia  Timor-Leste  Burundi and  soon  Darfur. We will continue to do so where our contributions can strengthen the overall capacity of the United Nations.  As a member of the Peacebuilding Commission  Thailand also strongly believes in building the right socio-economic and political conditions for sustainable peace in countries emerging from conflict and internal strife. We can play a greater role in ensuring international peace and security. That is why Thailand has presented its candidature for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council for the period 2017-2018. As a medium-sized developing country  we can represent the interests and concerns of developing countries not only in Asia  but worldwide.    09-52586 8   Over the past four days  we have heard statements  one after another  which seem to point towards one conclusion  that is  that we are living in a “challenging period”. And perhaps it is a period in which multilateralism is once again being put to the test. But we also have before us a historic opportunity to act together to right our past wrongs and to make the right decisions for the future. How we act today is purely our choice — a choice that will be judged by our children tomorrow and our grandchildren in years to come.  Our forefathers chose to establish the United Nations over six decades ago. We must now make sure that the United Nations — a symbol of true multilateralism — continues to be relevant  efficient and effective in responding to the evolving challenges as well as in ensuring development  freedom  human rights  and peace for all. In that regard  we support United Nations reform that will lead us towards those goals.  Let us use our gathering here to remind ourselves of what the United Nations stands for. And let us seize this opportunity together to lay down a stronger foundation for a new era of peace and prosperity for humankind. "
"169",6829,"TJK",64,2009,"At the outset  I should like to congratulate Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. I am confident that his extensive diplomatic experience and talent will contribute to the fruitful and successful work of the General Assembly at this session.  In recent decades  the world has made considerable progress in terms of technology  information and economic and social development  which  due to globalization  is being spread throughout the world. However  the negative aspects of this phenomenon  such as international terrorism  extremism  transnational organized crime  narcotics trafficking  pandemic outbreaks and emerging ecological challenges  pose a serious threat to the international community. The United Nations plays the key role in coordinating Member States’ efforts to effectively meet the challenges of modern times and to attain the Millennium Development Goals.  Tajikistan regards peacekeeping as one of the most important aspects of the work of the United Nations. Last year  for the first time ever  citizens of the Republic of Tajikistan joined police forces in peacekeeping operations  contributing to efforts to strengthening peace and stability in conflict zones. A national strategy on the development of Tajikistan’s peacekeeping capacity is currently being drafted.  Tajikistan attaches the utmost importance to strengthening the disarmament process. We hope that  at the 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  a constructive exchange of views will take place on urgent issues related to the practical implementation of that agreement. We are convinced that the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones is equally important at the regional and global levels. Tajikistan is therefore prepared to work to enhance its practical implementation of the provisions of the Treaty on a Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in Central Asia  which came into effect on 21 March 2009.  We support the leading role played by the United Nations in combating the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons. We hope that important measures for   5 09-52228  coordinating further steps in this direction will be developed at the next Biennial Meeting to be held on the Programme of Action.  Tajikistan supports the efforts of the international community to achieve the comprehensive prohibition of the use of anti-personnel mines. For our part  we are meeting our commitments under the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use  Stockpiling  Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on Their Destruction  by providing mine-risk information to the Secretary-General on an annual basis.  The first international conference to address the issues of the consequences of landmines was held in Dushanbe  the capital of my country  in June 2009. Tajikistan has long suffered the effects of landmines. We believe that Central Asia must be free from the threat of mines and we call upon the international community to do its utmost to achieve this noble goal.  The international community continues to fight terrorism  extremism  transnational organized crime and illicit drug trafficking. These combined threats give rise to greater concerns. We therefore consider it essential to expedite the adoption of a comprehensive convention on international terrorism. Double standards must be avoided in this endeavour  since terrorism has no national or religious affiliations.  The prevention of illicit drug trafficking is an integral part of the common struggle against terrorism. Tajikistan has developed bilateral  regional and multilateral short- and long-term programmes of action  and ratified approximately 30 intergovernmental agreements.  The Drug Control Agency established by the President of the Republic of Tajikistan  with the active involvement of the United Nations  has now been in existence for over a decade. The total value of heroin seized during these years  in terms of its average price in Europe  is estimated at $1.12 billion. This initiative has helped save more than 36 million lives from drug addiction. The Tajik initiative to establish an anti-narcotics security belt around Afghanistan was launched from the lofty podium of the General Assembly at its twentieth special session in 1998.  We believe that rendering assistance to Afghanistan’s target programmes could be one way to counteract the drug threat emanating from that country. Regrettably  the efforts undertaken to date and the resources allocated by the international community to address this challenge have not always been sufficient to counteract the increasingly aggressive spread of narcotics. In our view  the borders of the countries neighbouring Afghanistan should be regarded as the front line in this struggle  and efforts to reinforce that line should be enhanced. For many years  Tajikistan has acted as a buffer zone against the spread and export of narcotics  terrorism  extremism and other negative phenomena emanating from this area.  We are profoundly interested in strengthening lasting peace and stability in our neighbour Afghanistan because the security of Central Asia depends in every respect on the situation in Afghanistan. Today  it is obvious that the Afghan issue cannot be resolved by military means alone  but requires a comprehensive approach taking into account all the many factors involved. First and foremost  social and educational projects and programmes should be implemented in that country. We support the current efforts at peaceful rehabilitation and believe that the international strategy of action in Afghanistan should to a larger extent rely upon the Afghan people themselves  and that priority should be given to ensuring close and efficient cooperation with the country’s authorities.  The world situation is rapidly changing because of the financial and economic crisis. It not only undermines our efforts and capacity to achieve the Millennium Development Goals  but imposes new and complex tasks. We highly appreciate the United Nations role and efforts to address the current threefold crisis and mitigate its consequences.   It is well known that the global financial and economic crisis was caused primarily by the most advanced and wealthy countries  which unreasonably inflated banking assets on the basis of unsecured loans. We therefore believe that these countries must bear their share of responsibility towards the developing countries  whose already difficult situation was further aggravated by the global financial crisis. Partial write-offs of the debts incurred during the crisis  ongoing increases in donor assistance and rational management of labour migration would be very helpful in this situation. In my opinion  it is high time for a number of forums to be replaced by practical support for the efforts of the developing countries to mitigate and overcome the impact of the crisis. If the crisis should    09-52228 6  persist over the long term  it may be fraught with ever-more serious consequences.  Along with other Member States  Tajikistan supported the outcome of the United Nations Conference on the World Financial and Economic Crisis and Its Impact on Development. We highly appreciate the efforts undertaken by the High-level Task Force on the Global Food Security Crisis  and deem it necessary to enhance assistance to the developing countries in the form of financial and economic support and the transfer of modern technology and seed stocks.   Meanwhile  in our opinion the efforts to solve the problems caused by the energy crisis have not been successful enough. We believe that  along with the Millennium Development Goals  access to energy should be given top priority. Tajikistan  which ranks eighth in the world in terms of available hydropower resources — the total amount of which is estimated at 527 billion kilowatt hours — currently utilizes less than 5 per cent of its potential  and over the past 18 years has endured a chronic energy crisis for eight months of every year  primarily in autumn and winter. In recent years  the electricity shortage has been exacerbated by abnormally severe and long winters  the result of climate change. It is perfectly logical that  in the absence of explored hydrocarbon resources  Tajikistan should develop its hydropower engineering in a concerted and comprehensive manner.  The completion of the construction of a number of small  medium-size and large hydropower stations will help to provide energy not only to the whole of Central Asia  but to neighbouring countries as well. In this regard  the implementation of such regional projects as the Central Asia-South Asia Electricity Transmission and Trade Project will define the development prospects of our vast region  which includes Tajikistan  Kyrgyzstan  Afghanistan and Pakistan.  The ever-increasing need for cost-efficient and environmentally sound energy requires the construction of hydropower stations and water reservoirs  which are essential to providing reliable volumes of water  especially in years of drought. As hydropower facilities generate energy by utilizing water rather than by consuming it  hydropower engineering plays an important role in developing energy production and the socio-economic sphere  as well as in environmental protection not only in Tajikistan but in the entire Central Asian region.   Global climate change requires a comprehensive and integrated approach to the use of natural resources. We are deeply convinced that the Copenhagen meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change will endorse a new comprehensive agreement on this issue.  Every year  natural disasters cause severe damage to agriculture  the environment and the entire economy of countries such as ours. In Tajikistan  93 per cent of the terrain consists of mountains. The damage done to our country’s economy in recent years by such natural disasters as mud flows  landslides and floods is estimated at hundreds of millions of United States dollars. Tragically  that damage entails human casualties.  An assessment of the impact of climate change on Tajikistan’s glaciers has shown that  during the period of observation begun in 1930  the total area of the glaciers has been reduced by approximately one third. Since glaciers and snowcaps are the main sources for water runoff into the rivers  there is a probability that in the near future river capacity will be diminished by 5 to 15 per cent. At the same time  water consumption has increased  due to demographic growth and the expansion of areas of irrigation. In the previous century alone  the total area of irrigated land increased from 2.5 million to 9 million hectares  while the population of Central Asia grew from 20 million in 1956 to 63 million people today. In these circumstances  the countries of the region should review their programmes and strategies with regard to water use  especially in agriculture  and take consolidated and concerted action to promote sustainable development.  From this lofty rostrum  we should like once again to remind everyone of the problems caused by the degradation of the Aral Sea. The large-scale use of land for cultivating such agricultural crops as cotton and rice  which consume a great deal of water  has become the primary cause of this ecological disaster.  The most reasonable solution to the current situation  which is characterized by the salinization of soil and the irretrievable loss of 30 to 60 per cent of irrigation water  would be to adopt specific water-saving measures  such as the rehabilitation of irrigation systems  the reclamation of irrigated land  the   7 09-52228  introduction of advanced irrigation technologies and the partial replacement of cotton and rice with crops that consume less water  which would also help to address the food crisis issue.   Only an integrated and mutually beneficial approach of the countries of the region towards the use of water energy and other natural resources can help to resolve the interrelated energy  food and environment problems and to ensure the sustainable development of all Central Asian countries. It is no secret that humankind is already facing a shortage of safe drinking water  which is not accessible to more than 1 billion people on the planet  while in some countries the price of freshwater currently exceeds that of petrol.   As a country that has one of the largest amounts of freshwater resources in the world  Tajikistan is convinced that creating an economic mechanism for the cross-flow of water and energy resources between upstream countries that are rich in water resources and downstream countries where hydrocarbon deposits are primarily located would promote long-term mutually beneficial cooperation among those States.   Having put forward the idea of using safe drinking water from Lake Sarez to meet the needs of the population of the entire region  we propose specific measures in that area. We hope that the United Nations and other international organizations  regional commissions and relevant institutions can offer constructive and unwavering assistance on that issue  which is of utmost significance to our region.  As the initiator of the International Year of Freshwater 2003 and the International Decade for Action  “Water for Life”  2005-2015  Tajikistan believes that it is of paramount importance to expedite the implementation of the United Nations water agenda and to enhance it by achieving the Decade goals. World Water Day on 22 March 2010 will mark the fifth year since the commencement of the Water Decade. In that regard  Tajikistan proposes holding on that day a high-level dialogue of the General Assembly to discuss the implementation of the international water Decade and the Millennium Development Goals on water and sanitation. That event could be a milestone in the midterm review of the implementation of half of the Decade and evaluation of the progress in achieving the Millennium Development Goals.  My Government has already put forward a proposal to hold a conference for a midterm review in Dushanbe in 2010 that would serve as one of the preparatory events for the United Nations millennium review summit in 2010. I hope that that initiative will find understanding among and receive support from all Member States.  Bearing in mind the water crisis  which has been aggravated by population growth and global climate change  the international community should take specific measures to ensure the fair and integrated use of water resources in order to meet the needs of the people  environment and economies of all countries around the world. To that end  the Republic of Tajikistan has proposed declaring 2012 international year of water diplomacy  with the aim of developing  within the United Nations  further coordinated steps towards the rational use of water resources at the national  regional and international levels. Our country intends to further promote that issue at the General Assembly  and hopes for the support of all Member States.  Next year will mark the beginning of the third five-year term on the way towards the international community’s achieving the Millennium Development Goals. The year 2010 will be a landmark in the assessment of our efforts to meet global challenges  overcome difficulties and evaluate the progress in attaining the goals outlined in the United Nations Millennium Declaration.  In conclusion  I would like to stress that  as an advocate of broad-based cooperation  Tajikistan believes that only collective and coordinated efforts and effective regional and international cooperation can serve as a foundation for our common success in that area. The mutual understanding and cooperation that have prevailed in this Organization since its establishment remain the only way to a bright and clear future and to universal peace and prosperity."
"170",6851,"TKM",64,2009,"On behalf of the people and the Government of Turkmenistan  I heartily welcome and congratulate you  Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki  on the opening of the sixty-fourth session of the General Assembly and on your election as President of the Assembly and express my confidence that  under your leadership  this body will work successfully and fruitfully. I should also like to thank Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann  President of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session  for his skilful and effective work in that post.  The current state of global realities and the nature of and trends in today’s political  economic and social processes objectively require closer and more coordinated interaction between States and major international organizations if we are to accomplish our common main goals: achieving world peace and security  creating conditions for further development and progress  and protecting the legal and moral foundations of today’s world order.  The level of effectiveness of such interaction  striking a reasonable balance between national interests and the interests of the entire international community  will greatly determine how successfully we resolve equally important global problems with regard to the ecology  energy  food  issues of fair distribution of water resources  effectiveness in fighting poverty and infectious diseases  countering the drug threat and many other challenges.  It is impossible to talk about achieving these goals without acknowledging and confirming the critical role of the United Nations. For more than 60 years the Organization has been the main guarantor in maintaining and supporting universal peace  security and development. During that time  our Organization has won great credibility in the world  accumulating unique experience in resolving difficult international problems and forging a firm legal foundation for cooperation between States.  The United Nations was and remains the underpinning of today’s world order  a pole of attraction of the hopes and aspirations of all mankind. In the present conditions it is the United Nations that must become a pillar in the constructive activity of States in building a just and harmonized system of international relations.  It is from this angle that Turkmenistan considers issues of United Nations reform. We realize that on a number of aspects our Organization needs improvement and greater effectiveness to meet today’s needs. That is a normal and logical process in line with the logic of contemporary dynamic world development. Therefore we are for a rational reform of the United Nations. We will achieve that only by further strengthening it and steadily consolidating its position in the international system  expanding its role and functions as a guarantor of global peace  stability and development.  We are confident that United Nations reform must be sensible  targeted and related to the real needs of the international community. Turkmenistan supports efforts of Member States and of the Secretary-General aimed at making the Organization’s work more dynamic  more effective  more open and more democratic. In this context  Turkmenistan shares the view on the need to further improve the structure of the Security Council  creating closer and effective interaction between the Council and the General Assembly.  The main goal of our foreign policy remains the same: comprehensive assistance to the world community in its efforts to support and strengthen a global security system  to warn of and neutralize threats of conflict and to provide conditions for stable and sustainable development of States and peoples and for broad and constructive international cooperation.  In this regard  we believe that the permanent neutrality of Turkmenistan and the related consequences of its legal status give the community of nations good practical opportunities to positively impact the course and nature of processes under way in Central Asia and the region of the Caspian basin. That means creating here permanently functioning mechanisms of international contacts for discussing   33 09-52179  various aspects of regional problems and working out mutually acceptable and consensual decisions. Based on available experience and on political and diplomatic peacemaking under United Nations auspices  Turkmenistan states that it is ready to provide the world community with all the necessary political and logistical conditions for that activity.  In this context we consider exceptionally important and promising the decision of the United Nations in 2007 on opening the United Nations Regional Centre for Preventive Diplomacy for Central Asia  with its headquarters in Ashgabat. The Centre now works actively on monitoring and analysing regional problems. It participates in various measures concerning most important development issues in Central Asia  including at the level of heads of State  and helps to craft approaches for resolving those issues. Turkmenistan welcomes the involvement of various States  international organizations  financial and economic institutions and experts in United Nations efforts to draw up constructive models of development for regional processes.  In formulating our approaches to the problems of universal security  our view is that the concept is integral and indivisible  both geopolitically and from the standpoint of specific aspects. We are certain that security in one country cannot be guaranteed when security is lacking in the region  on the continent or in the world. Similarly  political or military security cannot be long term and fully fledged without guaranteeing economic  energy and food security  without preventing and mitigating the risks and threats of a man-made ecological problem  or without effectively combating international terrorism  organized crime  proliferation of weapons of mass destruction or other global challenges.  From this point of view  one of the most urgent components of global security is energy security. First and foremost  that is because the current system of international energy has become a vulnerable link in the world economy. That vulnerability is due to a number of reasons: political instability in some parts of the planet  a lack of commonly recognized international legal mechanisms  incomplete infrastructure and pipeline routes that are geographically limited. All of that affects the common atmosphere in the world energy supply market. There is an objective need to change this situation  to overcome inertia of stereotypes and to reach a new level of thinking that corresponds to modern demands.  Today  we talk not about adopting certain preventive measures or about local agreements on some aspects of fuel transport  but about the creation of principally new  universal models of relations in the realm of world energy  models that are based on a multilateral balance of interests  the coinciding of opinions and concepts on the global architecture of energy security and an awareness of the long-term benefits and advantages of cooperation.  It seems logical to begin international discussion of the problem of energy supplies as a first step in this direction. The discussion needs to find lines of coincidence of interests  to determine initial positions  to generate common language to carry on a dialogue — in other words  to create the basis for substantial and effective cooperation.  Therefore  during the previous session of the General Assembly  Turkmenistan announced an initiative to develop universal mechanisms that could guarantee reliable and secure functioning of the international energy supply infrastructure and provide for access to it and its effective use. A first step in that direction was resolution 63/210  entitled “Reliable and stable transit of energy and its role in ensuring sustainable development and international cooperation”  which was adopted by consensus on 19 December 2008 on Turkmenistan’s initiative. I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to all States for their support for our initiative and for their responsible and constructive position on this issue.  Mrs. Aitimova (Kazakhstan)  Vice-President  took the Chair.  In line with the letter and the spirit of the resolution  Turkmenistan proposed the convening  with the support of the United Nations  of a high-level international conference on the theme “Reliable and stable transit of energy and its role in securing stable development and international cooperation”. That conference took place in Ashgabat in April 2009  and one of its outcomes was the proposal to request the United Nations to establish a group of experts to make recommendations on a possible international legal document on the subject that takes into account proposals by interested countries and international organizations. Turkmenistan is prepared to fully support the setting up of such a group in the framework    09-52179 34  of the United Nations. We call upon all interested States to provide proposals for its programme of work. We believe that the establishment of such a group could be the first step in the process of drafting a comprehensive United Nations document aimed at securing the effective functioning of the international energy supply system.  Support for the process of disarmament  reducing weapons arsenals — including  first and foremost  weapons of mass destruction — and preventing proliferation continue to be among the most important issues on the international agenda. We believe that in the current system of international relations there should be no room for either the legacy of the cold war or for the recurrence of bloc confrontation  under which the quantity and quality of armaments were almost the sole criteria for establishing the influence and authority of States. We are convinced that the fewer weapons there are in the world  the more stable and calm will be its development and the more trust and understanding there will be among countries and peoples.  As the Assembly is aware  the Treaty on a Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in Central Asia was signed in 2006 in the city of Semipalatinsk. All countries of the region have now become parties to the Treaty. This joint initiative has proved to be consonant with the aspirations of the majority of the world’s countries. It has been highly praised by the international community and endorsed by the General Assembly. In that regard  we believe that it would be timely to hold an international conference  during the first half of next year  on the subject of disarmament in the Central Asian region and the Caspian Basin. Our country is prepared to host such an event. We would also welcome constructive proposals from the international community  including from individual States  on how to help global disarmament processes and on how to effectively address issues pertaining to our participation in the implementation of such proposals.  One of the most serious challenges in today’s world is how to effectively combat such phenomena as international terrorism  illegal drug trafficking and cross-border organized crime. For a variety of reasons  those problems are of particular importance for our region. We are convinced that only through joint efforts by States working in close cooperation with international organizations will we be able to successfully face those threats. Turkmenistan believes that the United Nations has a special role to play in that regard. We believe that it is both necessary and timely to reinvigorate the participation of the United Nations and its agencies in developing and coordinating effective models for international cooperation aimed at neutralizing those threats and putting in place mechanisms for preventive diplomacy and the establishment of conditions for the post-conflict reconstruction of economic and social infrastructure.  In that connection  we must underscore the special importance that Turkmenistan attaches to the reconstruction of Afghanistan and to the establishment of lasting peace on Afghan soil. Our country provides assistance to Afghanistan for economic  social and humanitarian projects. That work will continue. We want to see Afghanistan as a peaceful and prosperous country that is a good neighbour and partner for all States in the region.  At the same time  we believe that the United Nations can and should play an important role in resolving the issue of Afghanistan. We are convinced that  with its enormous peacemaking experience and great moral authority  the United Nations is capable of proposing new formats and models in the context of political and diplomatic efforts to resolve Afghanistan’s problems and establish peace and harmony in that country. That work could today be done more energetically and efficiently  given the potential of the United Nations Regional Centre for Preventive Diplomacy for Central Asia. We support increased focused involvement by the Regional Centre in the international community’s efforts to resolve the situation in Afghanistan.  The international community’s awareness of long-term development objectives and its readiness to work jointly to achieve them are today prerequisites for the stability of the entire system of international relations. The serious effects of the global financial and economic crisis have once again clearly demonstrated the need to join efforts in developing an international security architecture and establishing the conditions for equal and fair relations between States and peoples on the basis of recognized international legal norms and the timeless ideals of the United Nations.  Turkmenistan believes that responsibility  morality and humanism will be the criteria by which present and future generations will assess our work. As a State and as a member of the world community we   35 09-52179  will further contribute to strengthening lofty principles in international affairs while consistently implementing our philosophy of Turkmen neutrality  a fundamental part of which includes our strategic cooperation with the United Nations."
"171",6864,"TLS",64,2009,"Let me start by expressing my sincere congratulations to Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki on his assumption to the presidency of the United Nations General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session.  This year marks important milestones for Timor-Leste. Ten years ago  the United Nations sponsored the popular referendum held in my country  marking the transition to full independence. Seven years ago  we attained full sovereignty with the restoration of our independence and began  for the first time in the history of our nation  the challenging process of nation-building.   35 09-52604   We have been assisted by successive United Nations missions  which began by exercising  for the first time in the history of the United Nations  full administrative powers in Timor-Leste. This process has been undertaken a very limited number of times in this new millennium.  Naturally  there are always failures and successes in decisions taken and policies adopted  and those form part of our collective challenge on the nation-building road. This is true for both established and newly established States. Timor-Leste has been both showcased as a success story of the United Nations and hastily characterized by some as a failed State.  I stand here today  not to argue on behalf of one view or another  much less to duel over the past. I am here to describe what Timor-Leste is today  what we have been able to do  our modest achievements and remaining challenges  but most importantly  how we  as a new and small nation-State  situate ourselves in the community of nations.  We also want to be part of the solutions to the unprecedented challenges facing humanity in this new millennium. Today we talk about global problems that are the responsibility of all of us  requiring concerted and collective action  and Timor-Leste is ready to assume its part of that responsibility.  Let me also stress  however  that I am able to be here today because it was through the United Nations that a solution was found to what was then termed the “Question of East Timor”. It was the United Nations that shouldered the responsibility of finding a just solution to that question and that was  indeed  successful in doing so.  The decision to engage with the United Nations was a wise one  taken by the then leaders of the resistance  who are today our elder statesmen  our esteemed President of the Republic  Mr. José Ramos-Horta  and the Prime Minister  Mr. Kay Rala Xanana Gusmão.  The underlining policy of seeking to resolve conflict through peaceful means and of deferring to the United Nations Charter so as to enable the exercise of the universal right to self-determination is a fundamental principle embraced by the new generation of Timorese leaders. The engagement with the United Nations continues to be the policy of Timor-Leste today.  Timor-Leste has benefited greatly from this engagement  through the dedicated work of successive United Nations missions and through the presence and work of various United Nations agencies  funds and programmes. The United Nations administrative role in Timor-Leste under the capable leadership of our dear friend  the late Sergio Vieira de Mello  was without precedence. Could the United Nations have done things differently in those earlier and subsequent years and how can we best use this partnership to move forward?  Without a doubt the most valuable contribution of Timor-Leste to lessons learned and how to apply those lessons for future situations involved United Nations peacekeeping and peacebuilding. One of the most important lessons is that it takes time to build national capacities and sustainable institutions.  Young nations like ours have to evaluate and balance many priorities among various pressing socio-economic requirements  including the provision of basic social services  building State institutions and developing capacities. We have to balance justice with peace and reconciliation. This involves prioritizing many urgent demands and sequencing actions. There are no quick fixes or short-term solutions.  Timor-Leste has been the subject of a staggering number of evaluations and studies  about three thousand in number  including some on United Nations work in the country. As our contribution to the lessons learned for the United Nations  I have proposed that Timor-Leste  as the beneficiary of what has been done and in order to provide a country-based perspective  should itself conduct an evaluation of all that has been done in the country by the international community  and of how the benefits of these actions  or otherwise  have been experienced and felt in the country by the Timorese themselves.  The experience of the United Nations Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste (UNMIT) has shown the need for a longer term engagement by the United Nations. The crisis in Timor-Leste in 2006 was an unfortunate reminder of the fragility of peace when State institutions are still weak  capacities still need to be strengthened  and all competing social  economic and political needs cannot be met. The cost of dealing with the regression to violence in 2006 has been high for the international community  including the United Nations and our development partners  as well as for the Timorese Government itself. UNMIT’s mandate to help    09-52604 36  reconstruct our security forces and provide support for our justice system is central  and the Mission is still needed to ensure long-term peace and stability in our country.  The Government of Timor-Leste has continued to make significant achievements  although we still face challenges. Some of the main problems from the 2006 crisis have been resolved. Internally displaced persons have been peacefully reintegrated into their communities  the security forces are being reconstituted  although they still require capacity-building and strengthening  and gang violence has been stopped. Our State institutions are fully functioning  and the Government can now concentrate more on development.  I wish to emphasize the importance that we continue to place on relations with Indonesia  where we have taken a pragmatic approach and base our relations on reconciliation and the principle of looking forward. We cannot deny  or undo  what has happened in the past we share  but we are determined to be reconciled with that past  because we know we can progress and do much for the future. I am part of a new generation of leaders in Timor-Leste  and neither we collectively nor I personally have been spared the grief and loss experienced by most of Timor-Leste’s population. But I know that my responsibility is to prevent what happened in Timor-Leste in the past from ever happening again. Timor-Leste and Indonesia are both countries in transition  and we should be allowed to search for our own path  as President Obama has said  conscious that our path may not be perfect.  This is a complex process that requires a Timorese solution. I am sure that other countries that have been in conflict have appreciated the long-term support of the international community as they tackled the same problems that we are facing. Timor-Leste has not in any way turned its back on justice. Our Constitution enshrines the rule of law in our country  and the Government’s policy is to fully strengthen the justice system. We are being aided in this by the international community  and we are fully cognizant that we will continue to need its assistance in years to come. Our Government has been severely criticized  both internationally and nationally  on some positions that we have adopted and some decisions that have been taken. However  they were taken in the conviction that we need to be reconciled with our past and ensure peace for current and future generations  and we stand by those decisions.  Timor-Leste today has its own set of challenges  which may appear distant from the emerging challenges facing humankind in general and presented at this forum. Timor-Leste continues to be concerned with alleviating and reducing poverty and high unemployment  addressing the needs of the rural population and establishing and consolidating State institutions so they can better respond to the needs of all of our people. But that does not mean that Timor-Leste has its head in the sand and is unaware of other challenges. Our young nation will need time to address and overcome all of these challenges.  As part of the community of nations and humankind  Timor-Leste is also concerned with all that threatens life on this planet  and has expressed its views. In fact  as a Member of the United Nations  Timor-Leste has expressed its position in the General Assembly on a number of important issues. We wish to reiterate our opposition to the economic sanctions imposed on Cuba by the United States  and we reaffirm our support for the General Assembly resolutions of the past 17 years that have called on the United States to lift those sanctions.  It is not Timor-Leste’s intention to develop nuclear capacity or become a nuclear power  and we have therefore ratified the Non-Proliferation Treaty. We counsel caution in the development of and use of nuclear capacity. With regard to climate change  Timor-Leste  although an island State  is fortunate not to be immediately threatened by rising sea levels  nor is it responsible for large carbon emissions. But we are affected by changing weather patterns and we are following the climate-change debate. At the national level  we are naturally concerned with the preservation of our environment and consider reforestation and protection of the environment important issues.  As far as the financial and economic crisis is concerned  Timor-Leste has been fortunate to have experienced only partial impact. However  we are also concerned with the causes of the crisis  and we are looking to learn the lessons about what to avoid in building our financial systems and institutions. In light of this  we support the decisions taken at the recent meeting of the G-20 in Pittsburgh on taking preventive measures for the future.   37 09-52604   In conclusion  allow me  on behalf of our Government  to express our gratitude to the United Nations and our international partners for their continued support of Timor-Leste. We stand resolutely with you to contribute to solutions to our collective challenges  and we are resolved to find solutions to our own national challenges. "
"172",6880,"TON",64,2009,"Like previous speakers  I offer you  Sir  my warmest congratulations on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly for this session. I also wish to pay tribute to the Secretary-General for his excellent report on the work of the Organization (A/64/1) and for his continuing leadership during these unprecedented and challenging times. A testament to the Secretary-General’s leadership has been his persistent efforts to convene the Summit on Climate Change held earlier this week. For those of us who are also members of the Alliance of Small Island States  our own Summit  held immediately beforehand  was a timely exercise in focusing on the critical issues at stake in the run-up to the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference to be held in December.  Climate change has taken its rightful place at the forefront of many of the statements we have heard this week. In the case of small island developing States like ours  we all need to reach beyond our narrow national interests and embrace our collective responsibility to one another as nation States and to those most vulnerable and least able to address the adverse effects of climate change. At the Pacific Islands Forum  the issue of climate change and the type of collective effort it requires has been at the forefront of the meetings of Pacific leaders  most recently in Cairns under the chairmanship of Prime Minister Kevin Rudd of Australia. Such efforts resulted  earlier this year  in the General Assembly’s adoption by consensus of resolution 63/281  on climate change and its security implications.  It has been heartening to hear in this Hall words of action — a determination to move away from the rhetoric of climate change to the reality of action: action to mitigate the effects of climate change and action to stop the waste of our energy resources. But the words of Presidents and Prime Ministers are not enough. They must be matched by action. Our determination and our understanding of the truth of climate change must be propelled by honest efforts to mitigate and change the wasteful energy habits of a lifetime into the productive energy habits of the future.  The lessons of the past year have reinforced our support for reform of the international financial institutions. In particular  we look forward to the outcome of the just-concluded meeting of the Group of 20 in Pittsburgh as further crucial and concerted action following the measures taken in Washington and London.  Despite the uncertain global economic and financial climate  we remain committed to making further progress in achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  which remain a core component of our national development planning. Much of that progress has been reliant on our own   37 09-52586  domestic efforts  but it has also been assisted by our development partners. In that regard  we support the Secretary-General’s convening of a special summit on the MDGs in 2010 as a final push towards 2015. Further  the high-level review of the Mauritius Strategy for the Further Implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States  to be carried out the same year  offers us  as small island developing States  a fresh opportunity to take stock of progress and areas for improvement. We also welcome the renewed interest and engagement of the United States of America regarding the Pacific islands.  Earlier this year  my country  the Kingdom of Tonga  in compliance with its obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea  lodged a partial submission for the consideration of the Commission on the Outer Limits of the Continental Shelf. This was a significant exercise made possible through our own efforts  with the technical assistance of organizations such as the Commonwealth Secretariat. As we are an island nation  the living marine resources of our maritime zones and the potential of non-living ones remain critical to our future.   We continue to follow the meandering course of the discussions on reform of the Security Council. We maintain our support for such reform and hold the view that there should be an expansion in both the permanent and the non-permanent membership categories.  Since 100 per cent of our power generation is fuelled by imported fossil fuels  our economic potential has been adversely affected by rising fuel prices  which has forced us to investigate feasible renewable sources of energy. We thus have set the target of achieving 50  per cent of our electricity generation utilizing renewable energy sources by the year 2012.  We have reviewed donor funding provided by our development partners to see how best we could achieve that ambitious goal and also fulfil our wish to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. At the conclusion of the regional Pacific Energy Ministers Meeting hosted in Tonga earlier this year  we discussed those issues with our development partners. It very quickly became apparent that a new model for doing business was needed. And so it was that the concept for the Tonga Renewable Energy Road Map was born.  The development partners all agreed to collaborate  under the coordination of the World Bank  to assess the current infrastructure of on-grid and off-grid electrification throughout the Kingdom. The World Bank  the European Union  the Asian Development Bank  Australia  New Zealand and Japan readily accepted this opportunity to actively participate in the development of our Energy Road Map. Those efforts were recently boosted by strong support from the Government of the United Arab Emirates and the International Renewable Energy Agency  which was reaffirmed at bilateral meetings held in New York this week.  Tonga’s cultural and constitutional roots are innately enduring. We are proud of our 134-year-old written Constitution  which is one of the oldest in the world and is still in force. Our Constitution enshrined basic human rights and freedoms that today are the subject of international treaties. The Tongan way of life is not based solely on the rights  responsibilities  freedoms and obligations of the individual  but emphasizes rights  responsibilities  freedoms and obligations attaching to the extended family and the whole community. While the values underlying human rights may be expressed differently from Tongan customary and traditional values  and while both reflect similar aspirations  Tonga’s strength lies in the binding links of collective group values and individual obligations and responsibilities.  Our parliament recently considered ratification of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW). Parliament voted not to ratify CEDAW  because to do so would conflict with the cultural and social heritage that makes up the unique Tongan way of life. We take the ratification of international treaties very seriously. We did not want to ratify CEDAW as a matter of international convenience. We would rather be judged by our actions to empower women than by a ratification of convenience. And we make no apologies for our stance. We admit that there are issues to be addressed. But  rather than ratify CEDAW  we prefer to address those specific areas of concern to women in our own way. We maintain that our women are among the most highly cherished  elevated and respected in the world.  Finally  this month marks the tenth anniversary of Tonga’s admission as a Member of the United Nations. We reaffirm the rights and responsibilities bestowed    09-52586 38  upon us by the United Nations Charter  and we pledge to continue to participate constructively in addressing our common challenges. Those challenges will be overcome by our action. Given that the United Nations is the forum for united action and given the commitments made by leaders to such action  we may just awake to the fact that it is the good in the world  not the evil  that surpasses all explanation."
"173",6920,"TTO",64,2009,"In circumstances like these  I would normally speak for about an hour  but I would like to assure you  Sir  and the Assembly that the quality of mercy is not strained and that I will be considerably briefer than that. Today  I propose to stay within the time allotted to me.  Trinidad and Tobago extends its sincerest congratulations to the President on his ascension to the stewardship of this sixty-fourth session of the General Assembly. We know that his vast experience and leadership qualities will ensure very successful deliberations. We also pay tribute to his predecessor  Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann of Nicaragua  for his vision and fearless discharge of his responsibilities as President of the Assembly at its sixty-third session.  We convey our very best wishes to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon  whom we welcomed to Port of Spain earlier this year when Trinidad and Tobago hosted the fifth Summit of the Americas. We assure him of our continuing support as he pursues his    09-52586 16  mission to ensure that the United Nations meets the new challenges of the twenty-first century.  We meet at a time of very serious challenges for the world economy. We are now beginning to emerge from a global recession caused by a near collapse of the international financial system  but there is no room for complacency. Unemployment continues to grow in almost every country  credit remains contracted and consumer confidence  that most critical factor  persists at very low levels. Additionally  there is no certainty of a steady upward trajectory for the global economy. Valued opinion on this matter points to the possibility of further recessionary trends before the present green shoots produce flourishing green fields.  We clearly cannot take our eye off the ball. We must not return to business as usual. We should not countenance the resurfacing of discredited patterns on financial streets and capitals. We must be wary of the level of adventurousness in leading financial institutions that contributed very significantly to driving the world to the edge of an economic precipice from which we are just starting to pull back. There is justification for concern about this situation in every country on this planet. In the globalized economy  we are all affected by policies or actions that direct the international financial system.  We of the smaller countries and the developing world have always been the most vulnerable and the worst affected. It is happening again. Especially in the southern hemisphere  the prospects have grown for increased poverty  unemployment and general slippage in the development process. How much longer will this acute vulnerability of so many nations persist? How many more dreams must now  once again  be deferred?  The trust of the world in the totally unregulated market has been entirely misplaced. We must now capitalize on the opportunity of this crisis and  without delay  reform our international economic system. The global architecture must be transformed to take the new realities into account. Among these are new and emerging centres of economic power and the now indispensable need to deliberately generate growth in the developing world if the global economy is to achieve resurgence and sustainability. In this extremely interconnected world  it is our collective resources  ingenuity  productivity  markets and technology that will keep all of us afloat.  Let this General Assembly therefore play its part in ensuring that we leave behind the old approaches that suffocated development of the many for the benefit of the few. Let it call for greater recognition of the absolute need to bring into the global mainstream the entire productive and purchasing capacity of this planet  our collective home.  We are heartened by developments and decisions among the countries of the Group of 20  but we must ensure that there is absolutely no reversal of the new approach; no dimming of the new light that the present crisis has generated; and no diminution of the acceptance that we are all in this together and that development everywhere translates into prosperity for all. Let us therefore ensure that the reform of international financial institutions does indeed take place; that we entrench greater sensitivity to the varying needs of countries at differing levels of development; that new voices  respecting and representing more of humanity  are in the decision-making process; and that resource flows for trade and investment are in fact realized and activated.  The Caribbean Community (CARICOM) has not been spared the debilitating effects of the current global economic situation. Most CARICOM States are now experiencing economic contraction and rising levels of debt and unemployment  with their challenging social consequences. It is therefore regrettable that some middle-income countries  such as many in CARICOM  may not be eligible for funding under some of the World Bank’s facilities for international development assistance.   Given their vulnerabilities  middle-income countries’ need for access to concessionary financing must not be underestimated. This was highlighted in 2008 at the Third Ministerial Conference of Middle-Income Countries in Namibia  which called for enhanced levels of international development assistance and noted that the current categorization does not accurately reflect the particularities and needs of these nations. This General Assembly must take steps to advance the cause of middle-income countries in this matter.  The situation in Haiti is one of grave concern. We are encouraged by the diverse United Nations-related initiatives aimed at promoting peace and security in that country  but greater attention is required by the international community. Arising out of the Fifth   17 09-52586  Summit of the Americas  Trinidad and Tobago has advanced a proposal for the establishment of a hemispheric development fund for Haiti  to which all western hemisphere countries would be expected to contribute. Haiti is first and foremost a western hemisphere challenge  and we see this fund as essential to the re-establishment of proper standards of living in that country. We bring this matter before the General Assembly for its support.  One of the very significant problems facing the global community is transnational organized crime of increasing strength  which includes terrorist activity as well as the illegal traffic in drugs  arms and persons. The Caribbean is particularly plagued by the illegal drug trade  which uses our region as a trans-shipment route for its pernicious cargo headed northwards. This activity has a corrosive effect on our small societies  fuelling  for example  trafficking in small arms and light weapons  with troubling consequences.   In CARICOM  we have been pooling our resources for this fight. There is now unprecedented cooperation among the legal and security systems of our countries  but we need more resources in our struggle with this menace. We will continue to engage in the various processes of the United Nations aimed at addressing this problem. We encourage those Member States that have not been supportive of the initiative aimed at negotiating a legally binding arms trade treaty to join those States working to ensure that it becomes a reality.  But the security situation has been aggravated by the deteriorating economic situation in many of our countries  weakened by the loss of preferential markets for bananas and sugar. The situation is exacerbated by the new paradigm of reciprocity in trade  and by the fact that both the tourism industry and the financial services sector  to which many have turned to supplement their economic development  have not produced the anticipated returns. The economic situation of these countries has therefore become even more critical  with severe consequences for the security and prosperity of our region  given the inextricable link between security and socio-economic development.  Climate change is one of the major challenges facing our civilization today. The Secretary-General must be highly commended for his commitment to dealing with this issue  which he declared as a priority at the start of his tenure. In this regard  we add our voices to those that have praised highly the United Nations Summit on Climate Change  which has just concluded. This General Assembly must promote more meaningful action directed towards an internationally acceptable formula for the reduction of carbon emissions.  Trinidad and Tobago wishes to make it absolutely clear that we do not accept the per capita basis for the determination of levels of carbon emissions. It is manifestly unfair to a small  energy-producing developing country like ours with a small population. We consider the method of absolute emissions to be a more just method of determining a country’s contribution to global warming  since it is affected not by per capita emissions  but by absolute levels. The question of population size  in this context  has nothing to do with the matter whatsoever.  We also assure the Assembly that our country has already voluntarily embarked on reducing emissions through a programme that includes the pursuit of renewable sources of supply. We will also be hosting the 53 Commonwealth heads of Government at a meeting in Port of Spain in November of this year. This will be the last major summit before the Copenhagen Climate Change Summit in December. We propose to use the opportunity to attempt to forge a consensus that would reflect the common views of the Commonwealth  comprising as it does both high greenhouse-gas emitters and some of the countries most threatened by climate change. We are determined to do all in our power to ensure agreement in Copenhagen.  We are firmly of the view that non-communicable diseases demand the heightened attention of the international community at this time. It has been forecast that by 2020 non-communicable diseases will account for approximately 73 per cent of global deaths and 60 per cent of the global burden of disease. We join the call for indicators on non-communicable diseases and injuries to be integrated into the core monitoring and evaluation system of the Millennium Development Goals. We have taken this matter on board at the level of the Caribbean Community. Indeed  we held a special regional summit in Port of Spain on chronic non-communicable diseases in 2007. I now propose that this Assembly convene a special summit meeting of the United Nations on non-communicable diseases at the earliest opportunity.    09-52586 18   The year 2015 is fast approaching  but there has been  sadly  no encouraging progress towards our Millennium Development Goal of food security for all by that date. Indeed  we have fallen behind in our schedule  with an increase in deaths from hunger and malnutrition in the developing world. A much greater sense of urgency is needed in our approach to this situation. All countries must honour their commitments made at the 2008 High-Level Conference on World Food Security. Trinidad and Tobago therefore looks forward to the next World Summit on Food Security  scheduled for November in Rome  with the expectation that the results will aid the international community in achieving the revised target set by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations to eradicate hunger by 2025.  My country is committed to an international order based on peace  security and the right to development of all countries. We believe that democracy and representation are key to achieving meaningful and effective multilateralism. We therefore wish again to support efforts to reform the Security Council. Reform of that important organ of the United Nations  responsible for the maintenance of international peace and security  must include efforts aimed at making its composition reflect more closely the global geopolitical realities since the end of the Second World War.  In this new century  the United Nations must become an even more effective voice for all of mankind. We have very important work ahead of us at a very challenging time in our history. Let us never lose sight of our main purpose  which is the security and development of the people of the world. Let us renew our focus on this main objective.  Let us therefore support the reign of fundamental freedoms and human rights in every country. Let us strive for the individual empowerment of citizens in every nation; let there be opportunity and upward mobility for all; let none be marginalized on the periphery; and let the abundant talent and potential of humanity flower everywhere  serving as inspiration  guidance and example to present and future generations.  Let us therefore join our strengths for the benefit of all. Let us indeed build a global community where there is increasing and intensified cooperation and communication among our nations  where no country lags behind  and where all nations and their peoples are on the international road to development. "
"174",6967,"TUN",64,2009,"At the outset  I would like to extend to you  Sir  and through you to the brotherly Socialist People’s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya our sincere congratulations upon your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. We are confident that your broad experience and many skills will help enrich our work at this session and achieve the objectives to which we all aspire. Our high appreciation goes also to Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann for the excellent manner in which he conducted the work of the previous session.  I also express our warmest thanks and appreciation to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his tireless efforts in the service of world peace and security to promote the role of the United Nations  achieve our common noble objectives and find effective solutions to various international problems.  Today our world is witnessing profound and rapid changes that have added new dimensions to international relations  which in turn have altered the balances and equations that have long governed those relations. These changes have generated major challenges at various levels  requiring all parties to shoulder their responsibilities with vision and wisdom and to enhance their efforts to establish the foundations of a safer  more stable and more developed world and of balanced and equitable international relations based on solidarity.  We must redouble our efforts to reform the United Nations  which was designed decades ago  in order to update it to current global circumstances and enable it to carry out its essential role in maintaining international peace  security and development  and in serving the interests of world solidarity.   Global circumstances have changed since the creation of the United Nations. Its present structure and equations no longer reflect the reality of the world situation and international relations. Given our concern for justice and balance in international relations  we hope that the international community will introduce the necessary reforms to the United Nations system  in particular in the context of expanding the Security Council and increasing the transparency and efficiency of its work  while bearing in mind need for the broadest possible consensus among States on pending issues.  In spite of its complex and interrelated nature  the world situation can only strengthen our attachment to the United Nations and to its founding principles. Those principles constitute the ideal framework for coordinating and uniting our efforts to address issues    09-52598 20  and challenges in the implementation of the noble principles enshrined in the Charter  finding effective solutions to pending issues  mitigating the impact of the economic and social crisis  and promoting solidarity-based frameworks of partnership and cooperation  in keeping with a more comprehensive approach based on the close correlation between peace  security and development.  Further rapprochement and solidarity among the nations of the world remain  in our view  among the noblest aims of the United Nations and a pillar of the new system of international relations. Therefore  today more than ever before  we must further disseminate the culture of tolerance  dialogue and acceptance of the other and respect for cultural differences and religious symbols. We must build constructive relations among States and peoples  based on moderation and the rejection of extremism  violence and fanaticism of any kind.  For many years now  Tunisia has promoted initiatives to give effect to that noble objective  the most recent of which was “Kairouan  Capital of Islamic Culture for the Year 2009”  organized with the cooperation of the Islamic Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization and the International Organization of la Francophonie.  Globalization  with its numerous problems and major challenges  requires us to pay close attention to our young people and to constantly listen to their concerns in order to protect them from exclusion  marginalization and the dangers of seclusion  extremism  carelessness and estrangement  while at the same time instilling in them a culture of tolerance  compromise and moderation.   Based on the special status that we reserve for our young people  whom we consider to be our true wealth  the support of the present and foundation of the future  we in Tunisia have insisted on entrenching the spirit of responsibility within this group and encourage them to participate actively in all aspects of public life and in establishing the country’s future policies and objectives.  Based on this vision and our experience in dealing with our youth and its aspirations  President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali called for the proclamation of 2010 as the International Year of Youth and for the convening  under United Nations auspices and in cooperation with the relevant international organizations  of a world youth conference to be attended by young people from all over the world and to conclude with the drafting of an international pact uniting world youth around universal values.  We strongly hope that this initiative will contribute to deepening awareness of the position of young people in society so that they become active stakeholders in the success of our development processes. Furthermore  young people should play a major role in promoting dialogue and in enhancing understanding and mutual respect among peoples on the basis of universal values and noble human principles concerning which all cultures and civilizations agree — values such as tolerance  moderation and respect of the other; rejection of all forms of violence  extremism and discrimination; the culture of citizenship  solidarity  peace and communication; stimulation of the spirit of initiative; volunteerism and environmental protection.  This initiative already enjoys the support of Arab  African and Islamic regional organizations as well as the Non-Aligned Movement. We look forward to your support  Mr. President  for the adoption of a resolution by the General Assembly at this session in order to give concrete expression to this initiative.  Terrorism remains a major threat to world peace  security and development  in spite of numerous national and international efforts to counter it. It remains a challenge to the international community  and we have on numerous occasions called for a comprehensive approach in addressing a danger that spares no one. We must take into consideration the root causes of such phenomena  as well as just and sustainable solutions to ongoing world problems. We must work to decrease poverty  exclusion and marginalization  and we must confront extremist movements that favour fanaticism  seclusion and hatred.  As one of the first countries to warn against the dangers of this phenomenon in the early 1990s  Tunisia renews its call for the convening of an international conference under the auspices of the United Nations to craft a universally binding code of conduct to fight terrorism.  Faithful to its identity and keen to ensure its full integration into its community  Tunisia strives tirelessly and resolutely to enhance cooperation with its partners in various regional affiliations. In the firm   21 09-52598  belief that the Arab Maghreb Union is an indispensable strategic choice for the interests of the Maghreb peoples and will enhance the regional and international status of its members in a world where blocs and groupings are proliferating  Tunisia has spared no effort  together with other Maghreb countries  to complete the process of building the Union  promote common Maghreb action and work to overcome the temporary difficulties that are preventing its materialization. We seek thereby to ensure that the Union enjoys the position it deserves on the international scene and to increase the capacity of its member States to meet present and future challenges.  Tunisia also continues to work to promote common Arab action  revitalize its mechanisms  develop cooperation and partnership relations with sister Arab States in various fields  and bring about the desired Arab economic integration and complementarity.  Many international problems  particularly in the Middle East  remain unresolved and are a source of deep concern for the international community  with negative consequences for security and stability in the region and the world. From this rostrum  we reaffirm Tunisia’s constant and principled support for the just Palestinian cause and the brotherly Palestinian people in their struggle to recover their legitimate rights and to establish their independent State on their own land.  We note with satisfaction the positive stance of the United States Administration on the Middle East issue  the elements of a just and comprehensive settlement of the conflict  the two-State solution  and subsequent international efforts and momentum to revive the peace talks.   Today  we renew our appeal to the international community  especially the sponsors of the peace process  to intensify their efforts so as to compel Israel to end its settlement policy  without preconditions  thus enabling talks between the Palestinian and Israeli sides to resume  in accordance with international resolutions  all peace terms of reference and the Arab Peace Initiative.  Achieving peace and ensuring security and stability in the Middle East will require Israel to lift the blockade  dismantle the roadblocks and abandon its humiliating measures and other provocative steps against the Palestinians  as well as the recovery by the Palestinian people of its legitimate national rights  the establishment of its independent State  and Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Syrian Golan and the Lebanese lands that remain under Israeli occupation.  We also express our solidarity with the brotherly Iraqi people and hope that they will overcome the difficulties they still face  achieve national reconciliation and consolidate security and stability so that all Iraqis can devote themselves to the reconstruction of their country in a spirit of unity and accord.  The hotspots of tension and conflict in many regions of Africa  some of which persist  have devastated the continent  sapped its energies and potential  jeopardized its development  slowed its growth and negatively affected its societies.  Faced with this situation and given the necessarily comprehensive nature of any approach to world peace and security  the international community and the United Nations organs  first and foremost the Security Council  must support the efforts of the African Union and its member States and stand with the African peoples as they seek to restore security and stability and to overcome the effects of conflict and war.  Given the organic relationship between peace  security and development  and the world’s pressing need to reinvigorate the values of cooperation and solidarity  Tunisia proposed an initiative that was adopted by the General Assembly in December 2002 to create the World Solidarity Fund to fight poverty and lay the foundations of solidarity-based development. Today we renew our call to operationalize the Fund  thus enabling it to assist developing countries  particularly those in Africa.  On a different level  and taking into consideration the rich and long-standing political  economic  social and cultural links between Tunisia and Europe  our country is ever keen to strengthen its relations with all the States of that sphere. Tunisia’s relations with the European Union have seen tangible progress  thanks to both sides’ determination to upgrade their ties to the level of advanced partnership  thus opening prospects for enhanced cooperation in all fields and enabling our country to achieve further integration with its regional and international environment.  The Euro-Mediterranean region remains one of the main focuses of Tunisia’s foreign policy. On the basis of our strong belief in the importance of building    09-52598 22  a secure  stable and prosperous Mediterranean region on a foundation of equal partnership and mutual interests  we support initiatives and mechanisms to consolidate peace and promote development. From this perspective  Tunisia is determined to play an active role in ensuring the success of Mediterranean cooperation for the benefit of the peoples of the region.  Tunisia is also working to strengthen its ties of friendship and to broaden and enrich its cooperation with American and Asian States through the establishment of a solidarity-based partnership. We are thus laying the groundwork for a new era in these relations that will secure the interests of all sides  bring them together  consolidate conditions of peace and stability  and achieve further progress and prosperity around the world.  The peoples of the world today urgently need a clean environment and all States must preserve it in order to avoid the severe consequences of which much research and many studies have warned  as climate change has caused huge economic losses to the international community.  Seeking to meet the environmental  economic and social challenges caused by climate change  in November 2007 Tunisia hosted the International Solidarity Conference on Climate Change Strategies for the African and Mediterranean Regions. Our country also hosted the African regional meeting of the Preparatory Committee for the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in order to develop a unified African position and garner support for African States that are negatively affected by desertification and land deterioration  as well as to promote scientific research in this field.  Tunisia has spared neither effort nor energy over the past two decades to join the ranks of developed countries  based on an open-minded and forward-looking vision  the foundations of which were laid by President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. This vision has encompassed all fields — political  economic  social and development — and been implemented via thorough reforms to strengthen democracy and the culture of human rights in word and deed  and through the expansion of public freedoms and the participation of all sectors of Tunisian society in charting the country’s political course within the frameworks of the rule of law and institutions.  I reiterate in conclusion that our success in securing development and promoting relations of cooperation among all States is closely linked to an international environment characterized by security  stability and justice."
"175",7014,"TUR",64,2009,"It is a great pleasure for me to address and greet the General Assembly once again from this rostrum in my capacity as Prime Minister of Turkey on the occasion of the general debate of the Assembly’s sixty-fourth session.  I would like to congratulate Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. I also wish to express my appreciation and thanks to Mr. D’Escoto Brockmann for his able and prudent conduct of the presidency of the Assembly at its sixty-third session. I take this opportunity also to thank all the Member States for the high degree of trust and approval shown to my country in electing it last year as a non-permanent member of the Security Council by a wide margin of support.   09-52320 32   The global problems of our age necessitate solutions on a global scale  and we therefore need to work in a determined fashion. From wars to economic crises  from hunger and poverty to terrorism  from energy security to climate change  the problems of our world are extremely challenging. However  none of them is insurmountable.  If we are to resolve these problems  we need a fair and inclusive global order that is based on trust and regards diversity as a source of wealth. It is possible to make the transition from a conception of the world based on risk and perceptions of threats to one that is based on trust and solidarity. Indeed  this has become a necessity for all of us. To do so  however  we need a new kind of leadership. We can indeed make the twenty-first century an era ruled by peace instead of war; trust instead of fear; justice instead of injustice; tranquillity instead of terror and violence; and prosperity instead of hunger and poverty. It is our common responsibility and historic duty to participate in the construction of such a world  regardless of our differences of language  religion or nationality.  Threats such as terrorism and the proliferation of nuclear weapons have become sources of worldwide concern. Problems such as hunger and poverty  the increased frequency of pandemics  food and energy security  growing xenophobia and radicalism remain grave challenges. In addition  global warming and the financial crisis are fundamental issues that demand substantial solutions.  Against that backdrop  the relevance and indispensability of the United Nations has become even more evident. In order to establish a fair and participatory global order  we must work together to enhance the Organization’s efficiency. We certainly do not despair. We maintain our hope that the achievement of global peace and stability is within our grasp. We therefore wish to see the United Nations serve as the voice and spokesperson of the global public conscience. We believe that a more representative  democratic  transparent  just and effective United Nations will be able to make a greater contribution to global peace and stability.  The United Nations must become a much more effective institution on such matters as climate change  sustainable development  the struggle against poverty  gender equality and the protection of human rights and dignity  and we fully support reform efforts to that end. However  there is no doubt that the reform of the United Nations system will be incomplete if not accompanied by Security Council reform. I would like to underscore once again that Turkey is in favour of enlarging the non-permanent membership of the Security Council.  Another important aspect of reform that I wish to underline is the need to improve the United Nations peacekeeping system. In this context  we want the views and expectations of the United Nations troop-contributing countries  in particular  on such issues as early and effective coordination  capacity-building and enhanced cooperation with regional organizations to be taken into full account.  Turkey continues to be a force for peace and stability in its region. Especially in the course of the past seven years  we have made every effort to settle our problems with our neighbours. Thanks to this approach  which we call a zero-problem policy with our neighbours  Turkey has made significant progress in solving outstanding issues with its neighbours and has greatly improved its bilateral relations.  The problems of our region have global implications as well. Therefore  our constructive and peaceful regional policies serve not only our own neighbourhood but also world peace. However  we do not consider those efforts to be sufficient. We seek to move from a relationship of passive good-neighbourliness to one of active friendship and cooperation. The positive impact of this approach on regional and world peace is well appreciated by all our friends in the East and the West.   Another concrete example of this approach is our ongoing dialogue with our neighbour  Greece. Another case in point is our quest to normalize our relations with Armenia  which has gained fresh momentum of late and begun to bear fruit.   We also believe that the conflicts and disputes in the Caucasus  including but not limited to the problems between Armenia and Azerbaijan  are issues that need to be resolved. In this regard  we hope that our regional partners will share Turkey’s vision for region-wide peace  security and stability. We believe that the Caucasus Stability and Cooperation Platform  which we launched in the aftermath of the crisis of August 2008  can make a substantial contribution to efforts in that direction.   33 09-52320   Another issue of great interest to us and the world is Iraq’s territorial integrity  political unity and internal peace. We attach great importance to the continuation of the political dialogue process encompassing all groups in Iraq and the establishment of national unity. A clear manifestation of this importance is the neighbouring countries process regarding Iraq  which was initiated by Turkey.  In this connection  I also wish to emphasize the significance of the strategic dialogue mechanism set up between Turkey and Iraq  which is important in terms of both the fight against terrorism and other aspects of our bilateral relations. We are fully committed to maintaining and further developing this process.  Another area to which Turkey is sensitive is the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. In our view  the resolution of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict  based on the vision of two States existing side by side in peace and security  is an indispensable element of regional and global peace. The achievement of Palestinian national unity will expedite the establishment of an independent Palestinian State. Turkey has always stood by the Palestinian people and will continue to do so.   I wish to draw the Assembly’s attention to the following facts. The aggression against Gaza carried out at the end of 2008 quickly turned into a human tragedy and resulted in the deaths of nearly 1 400 people  most of whom were women and children  as the result of phosphate bombs. Over 5 000 people were injured and the infrastructure of Gaza was completely destroyed. Even United Nations buildings in Gaza did not escape this destruction. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon personally witnessed the devastation and voiced his reaction. The 575-page United Nations report on Gaza (A/HRC/12/48)  released on 15 September 2009  clearly confirms this fact.  It has been eight months since the declaration of the ceasefires that ended the hostilities in Gaza and the adoption of resolution 1860 (2009). Similarly  six months have elapsed since the Sharm el-Sheikh conference  at which the international community pledged billions of dollars for the reconstruction of Gaza. However  I regret to say that the human tragedy in Gaza continues.   People are living in tents and cannot find drinking water. In the face of this situation  are we fulfilling our humanitarian responsibility? What can the United Nations or the Security Council do? What measures have the United Nations and the Security Council really enacted? We really must think about that because the promises made in Gaza have not been fulfilled.   As at the time of aggression  Gaza has once again been left to its own devices in the aftermath of the heavy destruction it suffered. Currently  the importation of construction materials to Gaza is not permitted; only food and medication are allowed to pass through  and the suffering of the people of Gaza continues.  We demand that these obstacles be immediately lifted and normalcy restored to Gaza for the sake of the peace and security of Israelis and Palestinians alike. The Palestinian question cannot be resolved solely by satisfying the demands of one party alone. The security of the Palestinians is as important as the security of Israel. The Palestinian people’s quest for freedom and peace is as legitimate as Israel’s quest for stability.  The settlement of the Palestinian question  which is one of the greatest obstacles to regional and global peace  will be possible only when everyone is treated fairly and equitably. On every possible occasion  Turkey has stressed that it is not possible to turn a blind eye to the appalling conditions in Gaza  and we will continue to make that point. It is our common humanitarian and moral responsibility to ensure that the tragedy unfolding in Gaza is brought to an end and that an atmosphere of lasting peace is created in the region.  It is extremely important that the international community remain engaged in this matter and inject new vigour and momentum into efforts to resolve the problem. We call on all parties concerned not to remain indifferent to this question and not to condone further suffering.  We also believe that the resumption of the Israeli-Palestinian talks  which have been disrupted by the Gaza conflict  is of the utmost importance. We hope that the peace process will be revitalized as quickly as possible. To date  Turkey has made every possible effort to contribute to the peace process in the Middle East. The indirect negotiations between Syria and Israel  which we hosted in 2008  are a case in point. Depending on the mutual desire of both parties  we are ready to resume our active role in the future.   09-52320 34   We have always said that our neighbouring country Syria is a very important country in our region and is in a position to play a key role in the search for regional peace  security and stability. Lebanon  too  is of critical importance to regional stability. Turkey has expended intensive efforts to ensure that a comprehensive political compromise prevails in Lebanon. We will continue to strongly support Lebanon’s stability in the future.  We also believe that the dispute over our neighbour Iran’s nuclear programme  which has long preoccupied the international community  should be resolved through dialogue. Turkey defends the right of all countries to benefit from the peaceful use of nuclear energy. On the other hand  we also call on all countries to act responsibly and to bear in mind the serious consequences of the proliferation of nuclear weapons for the whole world. In that spirit  we supported the adoption of Security Council resolution 1874 (2009)  on North Korea’s nuclear test last May.  We also closely follow the situation in Afghanistan and developments in Pakistan. We support the struggle against extremism by the peoples of Afghanistan and Pakistan  with whom we enjoy historical and brotherly ties. We are maintaining our infrastructure investments in order to help those two countries achieve the prosperity they deserve. The ministerial-level meeting of friends of a democratic Pakistan that we convened in Istanbul in late August is an indication of the importance we attach to Pakistan’s stability and prosperity.   I would like to take this opportunity to announce that  in addition to becoming the lead country on Afghanistan in the Security Council in 2010  we shall also assume the chairmanship of the Council’s Counter-Terrorism Committee. Our strong support for efforts to achieve security and stability in Afghanistan and to combat terrorism will continue unabated during the course of our performance of those duties on the Council.  The Balkans is another region that we follow closely. We believe that the integration of the countries of the region into Euro-Atlantic institutions is important. That perspective should be maintained.  Turkey and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus support efforts to find a comprehensive solution on the island. The basis upon which such a solution should be built is right here under the roof of the United Nations. If all the parties to the current negotiations were to act constructively  it would be possible to reach a comprehensive solution by the end of 2009. We believe that the Secretary-General should  as he did in 2004  play a role in bridging the differences on which the parties themselves cannot agree.  It should be our common objective to submit the solution to be reached to a referendum in the spring of 2010  at the latest. However  at this juncture  I would also like to stress that  if a solution cannot be found due to Greek Cypriot intransigence  as was the case in 2004  the normalization of the status of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus will become a necessity that can no longer be delayed. It is therefore essential to realize that negotiations cannot be sustained ad infinitum  that the current window of opportunity cannot remain open forever  and that efforts must be deployed to ensure the success of the process.  I would also like to take this opportunity to emphasize once again that a comprehensive solution to be achieved on the basis of established United Nations parameters  which will secure the founding of a new partnership in Cyprus  will enjoy the open support of Turkey as a guarantor Power. A fair and lasting solution in Cyprus will make a major contribution to the transformation of the eastern Mediterranean into a zone of peace  stability and cooperation. I call upon everyone to do their utmost to help achieve that goal.  In the meantime  the Turkish Cypriot side is still subject to unfair measures of isolation  despite the fact that in 2004 it accepted all the sacrifices that the Annan plan entailed. It is not fair to expect the Turkish side to pay the price for a lack of a solution. The lifting of such restrictions on Turkish Cypriots will not only remove an unjust practice  but also accelerate the process of resolution.  Turkey continues to participate actively in peacekeeping operations around the world under the umbrella of the United Nations  NATO  the European Union and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. We also strongly support least developed and developing countries in their struggle to resolve development problems.  In addition  as a party to the Kyoto Protocol  Turkey is ready to live up to its responsibilities with respect to a vital issue that concerns the future of our world. We support the determined efforts being made   35 09-52320  by the Secretary-General in the process of devising a new climate change regime.  I should also like to draw the Assembly’s attention to another very important issue that poses a threat to our world. We should not forget that each culture and civilization flourishes through the inspiration provided by the successes of other cultures and civilizations. As a matter of fact  our common values today  as well as our science  law and art  have been influenced not only by the ancient Greek and Roman civilizations  but also by ancient Eastern civilizations. From Al-Khwarizmi  the father of algebra  to Al-Farabi  who laid the foundations of music; from Ibn Sina  who ushered in a new era in medicine  to Sinan the architect  who produced the finest engineering examples of his time  many Turkish and Islamic scholars  men of learning and artists have made significant contributions to the progress of humankind.  It is therefore essential to regard and understand diverse cultures not as the other  but as individual elements of humankind’s cultural inheritance  as well as to inculcate that spirit in new generations. That is the philosophy that underlies the Alliance of Civilizations  which has become a United Nations initiative that has strengthened its institutional structure under the co-sponsorship of Turkey and Spain. I have no doubt that the Alliance will make a significant contribution. We should ensure that it has a meaningful place in the Organization  as it can make important contributions to shaping a global civilization based on universal values centred on democracy  the rule of law  good governance  human rights  gender equality  young people and media.  In conclusion  I would like to express my hope that the sixty-fourth session of the General Assembly will serve the best interests of all humankind  as well as the interests of peace."
"176",7030,"TUV",64,2009,"I am greatly honoured to have this opportunity to speak in this body on behalf of the people and the Government of Tuvalu  who wish me first of all to convey their warmest greetings and felicitations to the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session.  At the outset  let me associate myself with previous speakers in extending our special congratulations to Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki on his election as President of the Assembly at its sixty-fourth session  as well as to reassure him of our support during his presidency. I also wish to highly commend his predecessor for his exemplary leadership and dedication to the work of the Assembly during his presidency over the past year.  As we begin the sixty-fourth session of the Assembly  the effects of the global financial and economic crisis loom over our heads. For a small island economy like Tuvalu’s  which is highly dependent on the import of products from overseas  the impact of the global financial and economic crisis has been severe. The price of basic food items has risen dramatically. My people are suffering from events that are not of our making. The financial and economic crisis and its impact on development and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals is a global crisis that requires the cooperation of all countries. Unfortunately  as is always the case  it will be poor small countries such as Tuvalu that will have to bear the burden.  Globalization has also left its mark in the context of swine flu. Tuvalu has not been immune to that pandemic. We are grateful that the World Health Organization has issued a call to action to help poorer countries respond to the outbreak of swine flu. Outbreaks such as this highlight the need for trade reforms with respect to access to medicines. In that context  the right to health and access to affordable medicines should not be a right for rich nations only. Every human being has the right to a healthy life.  This year is a special one for the people and the Government of Tuvalu  not because of something that we have achieved and are proud to celebrate but  strangely enough  because of something that has happened for the very first time in the history of my country and that we strongly condemn. This has to do with the actions of pirates off the coast of Somalia. For four long months  12 Tuvaluan seafarers were held captive by Somali pirates aboard a German-registered ship. Those brave Tuvaluan seamen were subject to various privations and will suffer the effects of that unlawful imprisonment for a long time.  The international shipping community cannot be held hostage to the demands of such thieves and criminals. This scourge must end. We strongly condemn that inhumane form of organized crime and strongly urge the United Nations and the international community to bring the pirates to justice through the application of the principle of universal jurisdiction  as well as to take immediate action to tackle the problem head-on. We also call on the United Nations to establish a special task force to address the issue of piracy.  The year 2009 will hopefully be a watershed in the global fight against climate change. In a few months  we will meet at Copenhagen to seal the deal on climate change. As the leader of one of the countries of the world most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change  I hold out great faith for that Conference. But my faith will be diminished if key milestones are not achieved. Allow me to refer to some of those milestones.   First  the international community must commit to a rapid course of action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions so that global temperatures do not increase by more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Anything higher would be disastrous for Tuvalu. Global emissions must peak by 2015  and decline dramatically thereafter.  Secondly  while we work to develop a new climate change agreement in Copenhagen  we must not abandon the Kyoto Protocol  which is a cornerstone of action to address climate change. Let me repeat: we must not abandon the Kyoto Protocol. I fear that some countries are hoping that the Kyoto Protocol will disappear so that they can make weaker emissions-reduction commitments. I hope that will not happen  as it would certainly be a significant step backwards.    09-52586 14   Thirdly  we need serious commitments from key greenhouse-gas-producing countries. The United States must take a leadership role and drastically reduce its emissions. I strongly appeal to President Obama to deliver a significant commitment on emissions reductions. We also call on key developing countries to dramatically reduce their emissions. Since the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change was developed  in 1992  the economies of a number of developing countries have grown rapidly. They must now contribute their fair share to emissions reductions.  Fourthly  we need a strong commitment in terms of financing and resources to help vulnerable countries build their resilience to the impacts of climate change. That means that we need a commitment to new money. It would be foolhardy to simply reshuffle existing overseas development assistance to support actions to address climate change. This is a new threat  and we must find new money to address it.  Fifthly  we need to reduce emissions resulting from deforestation and forest degradation  but in a coherent way. In that regard  carbon markets will not deliver climate change outcomes. We must develop new funds to carefully build the capacity of forested developing countries to reduce their deforestation rates. Whatever actions we take  we must ensure that the rights of indigenous peoples are properly protected.  The possible security implications of climate change on the livelihoods and well-being of the most vulnerable countries  especially small island developing States such as my own country of Tuvalu  cannot be ignored. Instead  they should be recognized and addressed vigorously by the United Nations as part of the collective efforts by all its appropriate subsidiary bodies.   Despite the concerns expressed by some Member States on the engagement of the Security Council on the issue of the security implications of climate change  I am pleased to note that the Assembly’s resolution on the possible security implications of climate change (resolution 63/281)  which was initiated by Pacific small island developing States more than a year ago  was finally adopted by consensus at a plenary meeting of the Assembly in June of this year. Tuvalu looks forward to the Secretary-General’s report on the possible security implications of climate change  as required under that resolution.  Globalization has made Tuvalu a very vulnerable country. It is vulnerable to global economic shocks  highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and  not least  vulnerable to disease outbreaks. However  despite the wide recognition given and reiterated with regard to our vulnerability in many different United Nations forums  such as the Rio  Barbados  Mauritius and Johannesburg conferences and in several major United Nations events  including the Millennium Summit  the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council have not taken it seriously into consideration when addressing the question of Tuvalu’s graduation from least developed country (LDC) status.  We strongly believe that Tuvalu’s economic and environmental vulnerability  like that of any other LDC and small island developing State (SIDS)  cannot be totally ignored  especially in view of the impact of the current economic global crisis. Although we are pleased to welcome the latest decision of the United Nations Committee for Development Policy not to recommend Tuvalu for graduation from LDC status for the next three years  we continue to appeal to this Assembly  the Economic and Social Council and our development partners to carefully reconsider and review the criteria and graduation rules for LDC graduation. We strongly believe that no LDC that is recognized as highly vulnerable should be forced to lose its LDC status.  One of the priority areas highlighted in the President’s statement at the opening of the sixty-fourth session of the General Assembly is United Nations reform and democratization. We could not agree more  especially on the necessity and importance of the reform and revitalization of the General Assembly and the Security Council to enable them to fulfil their roles comprehensively.  We commend the progress of the intergovernmental negotiations on the question of equitable representation on and increase in the membership of the Security Council and other related matters. We fully recognize the need to restructure and expand the Security Council to reflect a fair and balanced representation of all regions. In this context  we believe that small island developing States should be allocated a seat on the Security Council.  As a full Member of the Organization  Tuvalu is proud to be part of the United Nations family and enjoys a sense of ownership through the establishment   15 09-52586  of a long-overdue United Nations joint presence office in Tuvalu in May this year. Although we appreciate its establishment  we hope that it will not create another layer of bureaucracy among United Nations implementing agencies  but that it will be more responsive to the aspirations and needs of Tuvalu in a more coherent  efficient and effective manner. More importantly  it is crucial that the office focus on the establishment of more concrete development projects on the ground for the benefit of the people of Tuvalu rather than mostly on enabling activities.  I am compelled again to draw the attention of United Nations Member States to the plight of the people and Government of Taiwan. As a proud nation of 23 million people  Taiwan must be given the right to self-determination — a principle that must be upheld by the United Nations. Taiwan also has all of the hallmarks of nationhood. It has a democratic system of Government and it is certainly a responsible international player in world trade  development and diplomatic relations; not least  Taiwan has a clearly defined territory.  Although Tuvalu appreciates the long-overdue courtesy finally accorded to the Government of Taiwan to participate as an observer to the World Health Organization’s (WHO) World Health Assembly this year  Tuvalu strongly believes that Taiwan deserves to participate more fully as a member of WHO and other United Nations specialized agencies. Tuvalu therefore reiterates its strong appeal for Taiwan’s aspirations and desire to participate meaningfully as a full member of the specialized agencies of the United Nations to be given the proper and urgent attention they deserve.  In conclusion  my Government acknowledges with full confidence that globalization and its impact in every corner of the globe cannot be denied. This makes the role of the United Nations even more important. However  we need to conclude the long-overdue reforms of the United Nations  especially the Security Council and the General Assembly  to enable the Organization to deliver its services in a more transparent  coherent  efficient and effective manner.  We must work together to rebuild the global economy. We must work together to combat climate change  with special recognition given to the plight of the most vulnerable countries  especially the LDCs and SIDS. Not least  we must work together to ensure that everyone enjoys a healthy life. We will continue to support the United Nations and sincerely hope that it will not abandon the concerns of a small island country like Tuvalu."
"177",7076,"TZA",64,2009,"It is indeed an honour and a pleasure for me to extend my very warm congratulations to Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki on his well-deserved election to the presidency at the sixty-fourth session of the General Assembly. I hope that during his presidency he will help advance the revitalization of the General Assembly  reinforce multilateralism and promote dialogue among civilizations. I promise Mr. Treki my personal cooperation as well as that of the Tanzanian delegation in the discharge of his responsibilities.  Allow me also to use this opportunity to pay tribute to his predecessor  His Excellency Father Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann  for a job very well done. I thank him for the honour he recently bestowed upon the late Mwalimu Julius Nyerere  the founder President and Father of the Tanzanian nation.  Our deep appreciation also goes to our illustrious Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  for his diligent service to the United Nations and to humankind. His exemplary leadership and commitment to action in addressing the global challenges we are facing are appreciated by many of us. We wish him and his entire team great success in the future.  For over five years now  a number of countries in Eastern Africa  including Tanzania  have been experiencing unprecedented drought. We have never seen anything like this before. Maybe the effects of climate change are taking a toll. As a result of this  agricultural production has been affected severely causing acute food shortages. There is an acute shortage of pasture and water for our livestock and wildlife in the game parks that is resulting in the deaths of many of our animals. Rivers have been drying up frequently thus causing interruptions in hydropower generation.   The effects of the drought are threatening to reach catastrophic proportions if the shortage of rain continues for the next few years. It is important for the United Nations to be aware of this growing danger and to look into ways of assisting us. We should not wait to act until graphic pictures of emaciated and dying children dominate TV screens and newspapers.  History has taught us that the greatest successes in the development of nations began with agriculture. No doubt  therefore  the low levels of development in Africa today are indicative of the underdevelopment of our agriculture. Indeed  African agriculture is backward and productivity is low. It needs to be transformed  it needs to be modernized. The African green revolution has taken too long to happen.  Concerted efforts by African Governments and Africa’s development partners are required. Unfortunately  there is not as much interest on the part of our development partners to support agricultural transformation in Africa as there is for other sectors. This is an unfortunate omission which needs to be corrected. We look to the United Nations to take the lead in this regard.  Allow me to pay tribute to President Barack Obama for demonstrating keen interest in assisting the transformation and modernization of Africa’s agriculture. African leaders were humbled by his commitment at the meeting he held with leaders from sub-Saharan Africa on 22 September of this year. I appeal to other leaders to emulate his example.  Another issue that I would like to raise for discussion and action is the problem of youth unemployment in Africa. Africa faces one of the biggest unemployment challenges on the planet. African youth make up 37 per cent of the working age population in Africa  but they are 60 per cent of the    09-52425 18  unemployed. In some nations youth unemployment is up to 80 per cent. Africa has the fastest-growing and most youthful population in the world. Over 20 per cent of Africa’s population is between the ages of 15 and 24. As a result  a constantly rising number of young Africans has been entering  and will continue to enter  a labour market that has not been fast-growing.  Beyond economic costs  high rates of youth unemployment have had negative consequences in our continent. We have seen how some youths with no job prospects  and little hope of getting any  have become the fuel being added to the raging fires of conflict in many parts of our continent. They simply fall prey to the machinations of war lords  criminal gangs and political manipulators  to the detriment of peace and stability in their countries.  Creating job opportunities for Africa’s youth is an enormous task that Governments of our poor economies cannot carry out alone. Friends of Africa in the international community  both from Government and the private sector  have an important role to play in that regard. Allow me to commend the Danish Government for showing the way. In April 2008  it formed the Danish Commission for Africa to address youth unemployment challenges on the continent. The Commission  on which I was fortunate to serve  came up with five bold initiatives that I believe  if strong international partnership can be forged to implement them  can turn the large youth unemployment problem from a challenge into an opportunity. I humbly ask this body for the opportunity for the Commission’s report to be presented to the General Assembly. At the same time  I propose that the Assembly consider declaring a decade to focus on youth employment in Africa  possibly 2011 to 2020.   Two days ago  we held the fruitful high-level Climate Change Summit. I would like to thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and commend him for his leadership on this important and challenging issue of our time. The event will go a long way towards paving the way for a comprehensive agreement in Copenhagen in December 2009.  It was heart-warming indeed to hear President Barack Obama assure this world body that the United States will join other nations in the joint endeavour to save our common planet. We are also happy that  under the leadership of Prime Minister Gordon Brown of the United Kingdom  consensus has been emerging on making additional resources available to assist developing nations in their efforts at adaptation  mitigation and the pursuit of clean development.  Allow me now to talk about three side events that have taken place during this session of the General Assembly.  The first one was the panel discussion on accelerating the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  which was organized by Ms. Helen Clark  the new Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme  together with Mr. Douglas Alexander  the United Kingdom’s Secretary for International Development. At that meeting  important impressions were made about successes and shortcomings with regard to the implementation of the MDGs to date. The meeting was a curtain-raiser for next year’s MDG summit. I hope all of us will take seriously the observations and conclusions that were made  so that there will be no default come 2015.  The second was the meeting on maternal and child health convened by Prime Minister Gordon Brown with the support of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and World Bank President Robert Zoellick. The meeting was a great success. I was impressed and encouraged by the commitment made by Prime Minister Brown and by the support of the World Bank to save the lives of millions of innocent mothers and children who die of causes that can be prevented. While I applaud and thank Prime Minister Brown for his leadership  I appeal for unqualified support for the outcome of the meeting  for the sake of saving the lives of many women and children in Africa and elsewhere in the developing world.  The third was yesterday’s launch of the African Leaders Malaria Alliance. That was a landmark event at which African leaders made an unequivocal declaration of commitment to end malaria in their respective countries. The Alliance provides the mechanism for advocacy  collective action and follow-up on measures to build capacities to eliminate the number one killer disease in Africa. Malaria can be prevented  cured  controlled and eliminated in Africa. Many countries in the world have done so; why not us in Africa? I would like the General Assembly to acknowledge that historic event and render support to the work of the African Leaders Alliance against malaria. Once again  I would like to thank Mr. Ray Chambers  the Secretary-General’s Special Envoy for   19 09-52425  Malaria  for successfully organizing that event. I would also like to thank all African leaders for their support and commitment.  The gains made in the area of development can easily be eroded if the foundations of peace and stability are threatened. It is a matter of great comfort and pride that peace reigns in most parts of Africa  except for one or two hot spots — Somalia in particular and  to some extent  Darfur. There is calm in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Burundi is enjoying peace after many years of civil war and instability  which has facilitated the return of many Burundi refugees from Tanzania. However  there are more than 160 000 Burundi refugees who have chosen to remain in Tanzania and are applying to become Tanzanian citizens.   We have in principle accepted their request and are now finalizing the procedures to grant them citizenship. However  I want this body to know that my Government has decided that  if accepted  they will be moved from the refugee camps in which they reside at the moment and will be resettled in various places in the country. We do not want them to remain with the refugee mentality. We also do not want Tanzanians to continue to consider them refugees. That is going to be a very expensive exercise for which the support of the United Nations and other friends will be necessary.  Tanzania remains committed to contribute to peace in Africa and the world. I promise that we will continue to play that historic role to the best of our ability. In that regard  we are making good progress on our promise to scale up our participation in United Nations peacekeeping operations. We have peacekeepers in the United Nations mission in Lebanon  and we are ready to increase their number. We are also in the final preparations of deploying a battalion of peacekeepers in Darfur. We are going to honour the request made by the United Nations to work with the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) in the training of the armed forces of that country  under the Mission’s security sector reforms for the country. My message today is that we are ready to do more whenever requested.  Let me add my voice in support of the two-State solution for an Israel and a Palestine living together side by side at peace with one another. Tanzania is of the strong opinion that that is the best way to sustainable peace in the Middle East.   With regard to Western Sahara  we call upon the Security Council to expedite the process of giving the people of Western Sahara the opportunity to decide on their future status. That matter has dragged on for too long  namely  since 1975. The time has come to end the impasse.  I would like to reiterate that the reform of the United Nations will be incomplete without the structural reform of the Security Council. That reform should include Africa’s attainment of two permanent seats in the Council. Giving seats to Africa is not a matter of favour; it is a matter of correcting the historical injustice against the continent and its people.  Let me conclude by echoing Africa’s appeal to the United Nations and the international community to support Africa’s position with regard to unconstitutional changes of Government in Africa. In recent years  the ghosts of unconstitutional changes of Government have again haunted Africa — through military coups and so-called mass action instigated by insatiable demagogic politicians. There are people who want to get into leadership by using undemocratic shortcuts. The African Union has taken a strong position  which is enshrined in its Constitutive Act  not to recognize such Governments and to suspend them from membership of the organization until democracy is restored.   Such decisions of the African Union would benefit so much from  and actually would be strengthened by  the support of the international community and in particular the United Nations. Africa has young polities  and its democracy is still fragile. What the African Union is trying to do is to entrench a culture of democratic values and governance. The support of the United Nations and the international community is very critical in that regard. A decision to the contrary would undermine the African Union’s good intentions. Africa needs the United Nations to support that historic position."
"178",7119,"UGA",64,2009,"Before I deliver the statement I have prepared I should like to support one aspect of the long speech made by the Chairman of the African Union  brother Muammar Al-Qadhafi  which touched on so many issues  and that is reform of the United Nations system and fairer representation for the African Union in the Security Council. That is an African position and I support it.  It is said in the Holy Bible  in the book of Deuteronomy  chapter I  verses 2 and 3  that it was an 11-day journey from Horeb by way of Mount Seir to Kadesh-barnea on the border of Canaan  yet it took the Israelites  coming out of slavery in Egypt  some 40 years to complete it. It was a journey of only 11 days  but it took them 40 years.  In Deuteronomy  chapter VIII  verse 2  it also says:   “And you shall remember that the Lord your God led you all the way these 40 years in the wilderness  to humble you and test you  to know what was in your heart  whether you would keep His commandments or not”.  Similarly  Africa  especially black Africa  has been wandering in the desert of underdevelopment for much of the 40 years following independence. As it says in the Book of Common Prayer  one cannot help but wonder whether it was because we had “left undone those things which we ought to have done”  and we had “done those things which we ought not to have done”  and there was “no truth in us”. On the other hand  the Asian countries — South Korea  Singapore  Thailand  Malaysia  India  et cetera — did not similarly wander in the desert of underdevelopment. That is not to mention the People’s Republic of China.  Fortunately  in the past 15 to 20 years  Africans have also grasped the development compass. We have started to do what we had left undone for a long time  and the truth is now beginning to be in us. Uganda’s economy has grown at a rate of 6.5 per cent per annum for the past 23 years. During the last financial year  Uganda’s rate of growth was 7 per cent  in spite of the global recession  which affected us all. In the current financial year of 2009-2010  our rate of growth will be in excess of 7 per cent. In the financial year 2007-2008  our rate of growth was 9.8 per cent  before adjusting for inflation.  We achieved these reasonable rates of growth despite the fact that we have not yet dealt decisively with three strategic infrastructure elements: electricity  roads and railways. While we have achieved peace  macroeconomic stability  education for all  some aspects of health for all  economic integration in the region  international market access  democratization and scientific research  we have been slow on these three: electricity  roads and railways. This slowness was the result of dependence on foreign funding  which tends to be frivolous and erratic. We depended on foreign funding because our tax collections were initially very low  but they have now grown in tandem with the growth of the economy.  Uganda is  therefore  now able to fund road  rail and electricity projects on its own  although of course we welcome foreign investment. We can no longer  however  be held to ransom by foreign funding for those vital foundational elements of infrastructure. It is amazing and  indeed  shameful to see the low levels of electrification in Africa. In the United States  kilowatt-hours per capita are 14 124. In Africa  on the other hand  the figure is only 547 kilowatt-hours per capita. Some African countries have as low as 9 kilowatt-hours per capita. How could we expect growth and transformation in such a situation?  The whole of Africa needs to wake up on this issue and cooperate to find a solution. The same goes for our high transport costs due to poor roads and poor or non-existent railways. In China  it costs $12 to transport a ton of cargo between Beijing and Shanghai by rail. In East Africa  on the other hand  transporting the same cargo over a comparable distance would require $65. We are aware of these bottlenecks  and we are dealing with them one by one.  There are two other bottlenecks that we often talk about: the export of raw materials  and the failure to transform subsistence and traditional farming into modernized agriculture. The haemorrhage that is the export of raw materials  for which we get only 10 per   29 09-52179  cent of the final processed product  has been recognized by many of us as modern slavery.   In Uganda we are transforming traditional subsistence agriculture into modern agriculture. This involves using improved seeds  fertilizers  tractors  irrigation  breeding stock and agricultural practices. However  we know that we cannot do all of this sustainably if we continue to neglect the environment.  Therefore  our development and transformation manifesto and action plan in Uganda entails the following: peace; democracy; education for all; health for all; macroeconomic stability and economic liberalization; electricity generation and distribution to banish the very low levels of kilowatt-hours per capita; modernization of roads; rebuilding and modernization of railways; commercialization and modernization of agriculture away from traditional subsistence farming; adding value to our agricultural and mineral products instead of just exporting raw materials  including petroleum and gas; regional integration to widen markets as well as accessing international markets; environmental protection; and scientific research — we are already supporting a quantity of innovative research by Ugandan scientists.  Ugandans and other Africans in our region who have been chronically underconsuming in the past are now helping our economy to stay afloat in spite of the global recession  because they now have greater capacity to purchase what we produce. Their consumption is going up  thus supporting our regionally oriented industries. We think that we have at last graduated from wandering in the desert of underdevelopment and are now marching towards socio-economic transformation. We are finally doing that which we ought to have done and the truth  this time  is in us. The phase of what the French scholar René Dumont called “a false start” in Africa  or  in this case  Uganda  is over. We are entering the phase of growth and transformation. Thus  we believe  our economy will soon take off.  Thus  Uganda’s response to the global crisis has been fair  because of regional trade. It would have been fairer if we had already dealt with the three infrastructure elements I have talked about: roads  electricity and railways. This would have enabled us to lower the costs of doing business in Uganda and  thus  increase the profitability of enterprises.  Africa has great potential for growth that is not tapped. The current global crisis was caused by certain laxities in the management of some of the economies of the world. Those laxities need to be rectified through multilateral action  as some heads of State have already noted. We need to stop money-laundering and strengthen regulation. Multilateral action would also be welcome in unlocking the dormant potential of Africa. In the case of Uganda and many other African countries  we have a double challenge: first  the struggle to transform our economies from a pre-industrial to a modern state; secondly  to cope with the problems caused by others  such as the present global financial crisis and environmental degradation.  There are  however  a few questions I keep asking myself. Is the present profligacy of some of the developed countries sustainable if we all join in that lifestyle? Or was it only possible when a tiny minority of humanity was enjoying affluence? Is there a need for a more rational modern lifestyle?  The need for dialogue among civilizations is long overdue. That dialogue could help us deal with some of the headaches and dilemmas confronted by humanity."
"179",7166,"UKR",64,2009,"On behalf of Ukraine  I congratulate Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki of Libya on his election to preside over the sixty-fourth session of the General Assembly. I wish him every success in his activities.  Every year we all gather here at high level in the General Assembly to present our own national views on the life of our planet and its peoples. We strive to get the feeling of the overall emotional setting and pulse of human energy  ideas and quests. The emotional setting of Ukraine is open  principled and tolerant.  We have gathered here not to offend each other or exchange insults  but to resolve our common problems. I call upon all of us to use tolerance against bigotry  malignancy and arrogance. I say this on behalf of a nation whose last lustrum is unique in terms of challenges and progress.  We in Ukraine live in an atmosphere of strengthening freedom. This process is both grand and complex. Its difficulties discourage idealists and nurture authoritarian forces  yet they are another alpine peak for all who are enlightened to ascend. The milestone at which our nation stands today is the basis for moving forward to a free and safe life  to revive our own millennium-old tradition and its interrupted ties and to be again an active part of global civilization.  Our democratic choice is irreversible. As a free nation  we shall not accept any forms of interference in the internal affairs of sovereign States  any pressure on them or manifestations of authoritarian thinking in international relations. We remember the price paid by our fathers for our freedom  for the freedom of Europe and the world  and for the future independence of Ukraine.  We shall soon commemorate the sixty-fifth anniversary of the victory over fascism. This joint victory of the anti-Hitler coalition is sacred. The mission of all countries which remember the horrors of fascism is to avert any hint of a restoration of totalitarian ideology and its derivative: the policy of imperial ambitions  neglecting the value of human life and violating the right of peoples to sovereign national existence.  I raise this issue because we are witnessing the re-emergence of very disconcerting signals from the past  ranging from questioning the very existence of newly independent States to denying nations’ own views on their past and future. We are concerned about the substitution of concepts and approaches. Cooperation  openness and friendship between nations are being explicitly confronted by aggressive national egotism  which ignores the interests of close partners   41 09-52228  and dictates the right of the powerful. Unconcealed information wars  energy blackmail and economic blackmail  as well as interference in sovereign affairs  fall outside the civilized framework.  Most important  we strongly condemn and shall not accept any violations of fundamental international principles — in particular  territorial integrity and the inviolability of the frontiers of all sovereign States.  It is axiomatic for us that all United Nations Member States  and especially the permanent members of the Security Council  must be exemplary in abiding by the principles of international law  of equality of nations and of neighbourliness  for our Charter  which remains unbroken  entrusts the Security Council with the primary responsibility for maintaining international peace and security.  Ukraine acts in strict compliance with the goals and principles of the United Nations  and expects the same from its partners and neighbours.  Today I have the honour to confirm Ukraine’s resolve to become a Security Council member in 2016-2017.  Our country has been and will always remain a reliable partner of the United Nations in all  peace and security matters and in collective actions fostering stability in every region  especially in Africa. This year I approved the strategy of Ukraine’s international peacekeeping activity  which will consolidate our contribution and participation in this field.  Safety of peacekeepers has been constantly the focus of Ukraine’s attention. As one of the initiators of the Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel  we propose that the General Assembly consider additional measures to strengthen the legal protection of participants in peacekeeping operations.  Almost 15 years ago Ukraine voluntarily gave up the third largest nuclear potential and acceded to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty as a non-nuclear State. We welcome the steps taken by the United States and the Russian Federation to elaborate a new agreement to replace the Treaty between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States on the Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms  of 31 July 1991  which expires this year.  At the same time  Ukraine continues to count on the support of the Security Council permanent members for our proposal to enhance security assurances for non-nuclear States  in particular for those which have voluntarily renounced nuclear weapons or their development. That will become an important incentive for many countries.  Ukraine will continue to act responsibly and constructively in matters of military and security cooperation.  We strictly abide by Security Council resolutions  and adhere to all established international regimes. Our position in this sphere is consistent with all our international obligations. It is verified  balanced and unchangeable.  I wish to dwell on an issue of the utmost importance for Ukraine: the global fight against maritime piracy. We value all the efforts of the United Nations and the International Maritime Organization (IMO) in this regard. However  the measures taken so far have not been sufficient.  Almost 60 000 Ukrainian citizens are employed on ships under foreign flags. Any developments on the high seas affect us directly. In the last seven years alone pirates have attacked 18 vessels with Ukrainian sailors on board  and in the last nine months alone 35 Ukrainian sailors have been taken hostage. It is no longer a local problem; it has become very dangerous and threatens us all. We shall not turn a blind eye to it.  Ukraine was among the sponsors of IMO resolution A.1002 (25)  entitled “Piracy and armed robbery against ships operating in waters off the coast of Somalia”  which laid the ground for further Security Council resolutions in that regard. We strongly support the elaboration of uniform  clear rules to fight pirates and to protect sailors. We are convinced that the General Assembly has to become a coordinating body for the efforts of all specialized institutions in this field. We call for a more active stance by those United Nations Members which are main countries of origin of marine workers and by those States and organizations capable of making an impact on the safety of international maritime navigation.  On behalf of Ukraine  I propose to examine carefully the idea of establishing in one of the African countries a regional centre under the United Nations aegis which would bring under its umbrella specialized    09-52228 42  agencies  programmes and funds  as well as political offices  to counter piracy. I want to be clear: Ukraine will be actively engaged in all international endeavours  and we intend to join the European Union Atalanta anti-piracy naval operation.  As President of Ukraine  I urge the General Assembly to debate these very critical issues in a separate meeting.  We face manifold challenges that we can resolve only by concerted efforts. I am convinced that one of the most acute problems for us all is the global financial crisis. Ukraine welcomes decisions of multilateral forums  in particular those of the Group of 20  as the leading instrument to counter the crisis.  In this process  our Organization can and should play its role in preventing the financial perturbations from spinning out into social upheavals. Perhaps it is time to revisit the idea  put forward earlier by Ukraine and recently by a number of other countries  of the creation of a United Nations economic security council. The large scale of this proposal should not prompt us to shelve it or reject it altogether.  In addition  decisions on the financing of United Nations activities within regular reviews of the scale of assessments must be taken with due account of the global crisis.  The principal and most important objective for our universal Organization and for each of our countries is to protect common people from the crisis and to prevent the decline of their living standards.   Despite all the economic difficulties  Ukraine is aware of its responsibility to support other countries that have suffered even more. This year Ukraine has become a World Food Programme donor. We hope that our contribution will save millions of lives in Africa. I say to our dear partners that Ukraine understands very well your needs  and we shall strive to save people suffering from hunger.   We have gathered here today to get the feeling of the overall emotional setting of our planet. Ukraine’s emotional setting is resolute  persevering and benevolent.  We believe in our Organization. We are capable of great achievements. I am firmly convinced of our strength to move forward confidently for the benefit of the world  our peoples and countries."
"180",7213,"URY",64,2009,"As I did four years ago (see A/60/PV.6)  I once again extend the greetings of the people and the Government of the Eastern Republic of Uruguay to this forum  which is the most broadly representative body of today’s world.  Those of us here are aware of the contrasting realities of the present world; we are conscious that never before has humanity simultaneously been offered so many possibilities and faced so many threats as is the case today. We know that we cannot be indifferent to or be paralysed by those possibilities and threats; nor are we disposed to be  but what are we doing to dissipate the threats and take advantage of the opportunities presented by this reality? Surely not everything we would like to or that we deem necessary  and perhaps not all that we are capable of.  Concerning this task  the Eastern Republic of Uruguay once again reaffirms its unwavering respect for international law  which is the greatest guarantee for the sovereignty of peoples and their peaceful coexistence. We also reiterate  first  our firm rejection of the threat of the use of force or of its use  of terrorism  drug trafficking and all types of violence and discrimination. Secondly  we repeat our determined support for a peaceful solution to conflicts  to the sovereign equality of States  to non-intervention in the internal affairs of States  to the self-determination of peoples  to international cooperation in economic and social matters  and to multilateralism that also includes free trade  because protectionism is to commerce as authoritarianism is to democracy.  Thirdly  we reiterate our steadfast commitment to the advancement and protection of human rights  because they constitute the ethics of liberty and democracy and are aspects of the dignity that we need  much as we need the air we breathe almost without being conscious of it.  Fourthly  we repeat our unwavering responsibility in the protection of the environment as a human right and as a fundamental aspect of achieving truly sustainable development.  As Americans  we feel it is our ethical duty and political responsibility to reiterate in this global forum that  first  we reject the institutional rupture in the fraternal Republic of Honduras  and we demand the immediate restoration of constitutional order and the restoring to their posts of the authorities democratically elected by the Honduran people. Secondly  we will persevere in the effort to achieve an American integration without exclusions or exceptions or embargoes  such the one imposed on Cuba  one without first  second or third class members. We are all Americans  and equals.  Without actions following  postulates are sterile. Uruguay is one of the main troop contributors to United Nations peacekeeping operations. The difficulties that this peacekeeping system is going through are due  among other factors  to the growing demand for missions  their equally growing complexity and the effects of the global economic crisis on the funding for these operations. Far from discouraging us  they stimulate us to bolster and coordinate efforts with other Member States and the United Nations Secretariat to collaborate in stabilizing the areas affected by conflicts  in the protection of the civilian population  institutional strengthening and the promotion of bases for economic and social development of affected countries. Similarly  our staunch rejection of terrorism is not incompatible with cooperation among States in the fight against it while maintaining absolute respect for international law and human rights.  Uruguay is among the countries that are signatories to the widest range of human rights conventions  and on the occasion of the treaty-signing ceremony for the present period  Uruguay will sign the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic  Social and Cultural Rights  becoming one of the first signatories to that important international instrument. Uruguay is also party to the main international conventions in the sphere of the environment and sustainable development.  As is well known  Uruguay receives significant investments that contribute to its industrial development  but it also exercises rigorous control over their environmental quality  applying its internationally recognized regulations  demanding the use of the best   39 09-52179  available technologies  and practising effective control in the field over environmental impacts. Uruguay is also responsible  transparent and reliable as regards investment for sustainable development.  In the era of globalization  it is not only the economy that has to be globalized. Peace  freedom  democracy  justice  dignity and the welfare of the people must be globalized as well. The countries represented here  each according to its respective identity  are working towards that end  as is Uruguay. Faced with the impossibility of discussing the vast system of policies and actions that are involved in that task  I will mention just two that Uruguayans wish to share with the international community  because they concern the needs  hopes  rights and responsibilities of all humankind.  Our country has taken a firm commitment as regards tobacco control policies  both at the international level through its ratification of the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control  and at the national level through the implementation of policies for the improvement of the well-being of the population. In 2006  Uruguay became the first smoke-free country in the Americas and the seventh in the world.  This is no insignificant matter when one takes into account that  according to the World Health Organization  smoking is the leading avoidable cause of death worldwide. It is an epidemic that annually causes more than 5 million deaths throughout the world and more than 1 million in the Americas. Five million deaths a year are far more than those caused by alcoholism  traffic accidents  AIDS  illegal drugs  murder  suicide and the H1N1 virus combined. When we add up all the deaths caused by these pathologies  we find that the number of tobacco-related deaths is greater still. If the current trend continues  over the next 20 years tobacco-related deaths will double in the world and triple in our region  and in particular in the poorest countries.  Given that tobacco smoke does not affect smokers alone  in a study published in 1985 the English epidemiologist Richard Doll maintained that being in a room with a smoker for one hour a day is 100 times more likely to cause lung cancer in a non-smoker than spending 20 years in a building containing asbestos.  Our delegation at the United Nations sponsored and promoted resolution 63/8  whose implementation will allow us to have  at least in this environment  a smoke-free United Nations. It represents partial but auspicious progress in the fight against this epidemic.  In May 2007  a year after becoming a smoke-free country  Uruguay set out on the path to becoming a country with equal-opportunity access to information technologies. We are achieving this by means of the Ceibal project  also known as “one laptop per child”  which consists  precisely  in providing each student and teacher of our public primary school system with a free computer and access to the Internet. By the end of this year  we will have provided a prototype to each of the 301 143 students and to 12 879 teachers in the country’s 2 064 public elementary schools. This may seem like a small number  but it should be recalled that Uruguay has only some 3 million inhabitants.  The project is open to students with learning  motor or visual disabilities  who receive computers especially designed for their needs. Private schools are not excluded from the programme and can take part by purchasing the prototype for a modest sum. The Ceibal project is completely funded by the Uruguayan State  which allocates funds not only for acquiring and preparing the prototypes  but also for their maintenance and the continuity of the programme.  The Ceibal project is much more than simply the provision of computers and is therefore worth much more than its price. Its true worth lies in developing intelligence  introducing deep changes in teaching and learning  offering equal opportunities in access to information from childhood on — because equality is not a right for adults alone — and providing the information and knowledge indispensable to becoming a member of society and thus ensuring its proper functioning.  At the beginning of this address  I stated that if the United Nations raison d’être is to improve what we are as human beings  the Organization must be capable of improving itself as a system. But the United Nations is those who comprise it — we ourselves. Uruguay reaffirms its commitment to the United Nations reform process. The process that began at the 2005 Summit  which saw the creation of two new structures within the Organization — the Human Rights Council and the Peacebuilding Commission — should be completed with consideration for those issues whose practical    09-52179 40  implementation is pending or behind schedule with respect to the goals we have set.  Michel de Montaigne taught us that there is no greater destiny for human beings than seeing to the business of being human. Almost five centuries later  it is fitting to remember the teachings of that great Renaissance humanist. It should not  however  be remembered solely as something of the past; we should embrace it as a task of the present and put it into practice  or at least try. I believe that there is no other option if we really wish to survive as a species and to improve as human beings. I also believe that  if we all make a responsible attempt  we shall achieve it. In that conviction  intention and confidence  I greet the United Nations on behalf of the Eastern Republic of Uruguay."
"181",7260,"USA",64,2009,"It is my honour to address the Assembly for the first time as the forty-fourth President of the United States. I come before you humbled by the responsibility that the American people have placed upon me  mindful of the enormous challenges of our moment in history and determined to act boldly and collectively on behalf of justice and prosperity at home and abroad.  I have been in office for just nine months  though some days it seems a lot longer. I am well aware of the expectations that accompany my presidency around the world. Those expectations are not about me. Rather they are  I believe  rooted in a discontent with the status quo that has allowed us to be increasingly defined by our differences and outpaced by our problems. But they are also rooted in hope — the hope that real change is possible and the hope that America will be a leader in bringing about such change.  I took office at a time when many around the world had come to view America with scepticism and distrust. A part of that was due to misperceptions and misinformation about my country. Part was due to opposition to specific policies and a belief that on certain critical issues America had acted unilaterally  without regard for the interests of others. That has fed an almost reflexive anti-Americanism  which too often has served as an excuse for collective inaction.  Like all of you  my responsibility is to act in the interests of my nation and my people  and I will never apologize for defending those interests. But it is my deeply held belief that in the year 2009  more than at any point in human history  the interests of nations and peoples are shared. The religious convictions that we hold in our hearts can forge new bonds among people  or they can tear us apart. The technology we harness can light the path to peace  or forever darken it. The energy we use can sustain our planet  or destroy it. What happens to the hope of a single child  anywhere  can enrich our world  or impoverish it.  In this Hall  we come from many places  but we share a common future. No longer do we have the luxury of indulging our differences to the exclusion of the work that we must do together. I have carried this message from London to Ankara  from Port-of-Spain to Moscow  from Accra to Cairo  and it is what I will speak about today.  Because the time has come for the world to move in a new direction  we must embrace a new era of engagement based on mutual interests and mutual respect  and our work must begin now. We know the future will be forged by deeds  and not simply words. Speeches alone will not solve our problems. It will take persistent action.  So for those who question the character and cause of my nation  I ask you to look at the concrete actions we have taken in just nine months.  On my first day in office I prohibited  without exception or equivocation  the use of torture by the United States of America. I ordered the prison at Guantanamo Bay closed  and we are doing the hard work of forging a framework to combat extremism within the rule of law.  Every nation must know that America will live its values  and we will lead by example. We have set a clear and focused goal to work with all members of this body to disrupt  dismantle and defeat Al-Qaida and its extremist allies — a network that has killed thousands of people of many faiths and nations and has plotted to blow up this very building. In Afghanistan and Pakistan  we and many nations here are helping those Governments to develop the capacity to take the lead in this effort  while working to advance opportunity and security for their people.  In Iraq we are responsibly ending a war. We have removed American combat brigades from Iraqi cities and set a deadline of next August to remove all our combat brigades from Iraqi territory. I have made clear that we will help Iraqis make the transition to full responsibility for their future and keep our commitment to remove all American troops by the end of 2011.  I have outlined a comprehensive agenda to seek the goal of a world without nuclear weapons. In Moscow  the United States and Russia announced that we would pursue substantial reductions in our strategic warheads and launchers. In the Conference on Disarmament we agreed on a workplan to negotiate an end to the production of fissile materials for nuclear weapons. And this week  my Secretary of State will become the first senior American representative to the    09-52179 10  annual members’ conference of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.  Upon taking office  I appointed a special envoy for Middle East peace  and America has worked steadily and aggressively to advance the cause of two States — Israel and Palestine — in which peace and security take root and the rights of both Israelis and Palestinians are respected.  To confront climate change we have invested $80 billion in clean energy. We have substantially increased our fuel efficiency standards. We have provided new incentives for conservation  launched an energy partnership across the Americas and moved from being a bystander to being a leader in international climate negotiations.  To overcome an economic crisis that touches every corner of the world  we worked with the Group of 20 nations to forge a coordinated international response of over $2 trillion in stimulus to bring the global economy back from the brink. We mobilized resources that help prevent the crisis from spreading further to developing countries  and we joined with others to launch a $20 billion global food security initiative that will lend a hand to those who need it most and help them build their own capacity.  We have also re-engaged the United Nations. We have paid our bills. We have joined the Human Rights Council. We have signed the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. We have fully embraced the Millennium Development Goals  and we address our priorities here in this institution  for instance through the Security Council meeting on nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament that I will chair tomorrow and through the issues that I will discuss today.  That is what we have already done  but it is just a beginning. Some of our actions have yielded progress; some have laid the groundwork for progress in the future. But make no mistake: this cannot solely be America’s endeavour. Those who used to chastise America for acting alone in the world cannot now stand by and wait for America to solve the world’s problems alone. We have sought  in word and deed  a new era of engagement with the world  and now is the time for all of us to take our share of responsibility for a global response to global challenges.  If we are honest with ourselves  we need to admit that we are not living up to that responsibility. Consider the course that we are on if we fail to confront the status quo: extremists sowing terror in pockets of the world  protracted conflicts that grind on and on  genocide  mass atrocities  more nations with nuclear weapons  melting ice caps and ravaged populations  persistent poverty and pandemic disease.  I say this not to sow fear  but to state a fact. The magnitude of our challenges has yet to be met by the measure of our actions. This body was founded on the belief that the nations of the world could solve their problems together. Franklin Roosevelt  who died before he could see his vision for this institution become a reality  put it this way:  “The structure of world peace cannot be the work of one man  or one party  or one nation. It cannot be a peace of large nations or of small nations. It must be a peace which rests on the cooperative effort of the whole world.”  The cooperative effort of the whole world — those words ring even more true today when it is not simply peace  but our very health and prosperity that we hold in common. Yet  we also know that this body is made up of sovereign States and that  sadly but not surprisingly  this body has often become a forum for sowing discord instead of forging common ground  a venue for playing politics and exploiting grievances rather than solving problems. After all  it is easy to walk up to this podium and point fingers and stoke divisions. Nothing is easier than blaming others for our troubles and absolving ourselves of responsibility for our choices and our actions. Anybody can do that. Responsibility and leadership in the twenty-first century demand more.  In an era when our destiny is shared  power is no longer a zero-sum game. No one nation can or should try to dominate another nation. No world order that elevates one nation or group of people over another will succeed. No balance of power among nations will hold. The traditional divisions between nations of the South and the North make no sense in an interconnected world  nor do alignments of nations rooted in the cleavages of a long-gone cold war.  The time has come to realize that the old habits and the old arguments are irrelevant to the challenges faced by our peoples. They leave nations to act in opposition to the very goals that they claim to pursue and to vote  often in this body  against the interests of their own people. They build up walls between us and   11 09-52179  the future that our peoples seek  and the time has come for those walls to come down. Together we must build new coalitions that bridge old divides — coalitions of different faiths and creeds  of North and South  East  West  black  white and brown.  The choice is ours. We can be remembered as the generation that chose to drag the arguments of the twentieth century into the twenty-first  and that put off hard choices  refused to look ahead  and failed to keep pace because we defined ourselves by what we were against instead of what we were for; or we can be a generation that chooses to see the shoreline beyond the rough waters ahead  that comes together to serve the common interests of human beings  and finally gives meaning to the promise imbedded in the name given to this institution — the United Nations. That is the future America wants — a future of peace and prosperity that we can reach only if we recognize that all nations have rights. But all nations have responsibilities as well. That is the bargain that makes this work. That must be the guiding principle of international cooperation.  Today  let me put forward four pillars that I believe are fundamental to the future that we want for our children: non-proliferation and disarmament  the promotion of peace and security  the preservation of our planet  and a global economy that advances opportunity for all people.  First  we must stop the spread of nuclear weapons and seek the goal of a world without them. This institution was founded at the dawn of the atomic age in part because man’s capacity to kill had to be contained. For decades  we averted disaster  even under the shadow of a super-Power stand-off. But today the threat of proliferation is growing in scope and complexity. If we fail to act  we will invite nuclear arms races in every region and the prospect of wars and acts of terror on a scale that we can hardly imagine.  A fragile consensus stands in the way of this frightening outcome  and that is the basic bargain that shapes the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). It says that all nations have the right to peaceful nuclear energy  and that nations with nuclear weapons have a responsibility to move towards disarmament and those without them have the responsibility to forsake them. The next 12 months could be pivotal in determining whether this compact will be strengthened or will slowly dissolve.  America intends to keep our end of the bargain. We will pursue a new agreement with Russia to substantially reduce our strategic warheads and launches. We will move forward with ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and work with others to bring the Treaty into force  so that nuclear testing is permanently prohibited. We will complete a nuclear posture review that opens the door to deeper cuts and reduces the role of nuclear weapons  and we will call upon countries to begin negotiations in January on a treaty to end the production of fissile material for weapons.  I will also host a summit next April that reaffirms each nation’s responsibility to secure nuclear material on its territory and to help those who cannot  because we must never allow a single nuclear device to fall into the hands of a violent extremist. And we will work to strengthen the institutions and initiatives that combat nuclear smuggling and theft.  All of this must support efforts to strengthen the NPT. Those nations that refuse to live up to their obligations must face consequences. Let me be clear: This is not about singling out individual nations. It is about standing up for the rights of all nations that do live up to their responsibilities  because a world in which International Atomic Energy Agency inspections are avoided and the United Nations demands are ignored will leave all people less safe and all nations less secure.  In their actions to date  the Governments of North Korea and Iran threaten to take us down this dangerous slope. We respect their rights as members of the community of nations. I have said before and I will repeat: I am committed to diplomacy that opens a path to greater prosperity and more secure peace for both nations if they live up to their obligations. But if the Governments of Iran and North Korea choose to ignore international standards; if they put the pursuit of nuclear weapons ahead of regional stability and the security and opportunity of their own people; if they are oblivious to the dangers of escalating nuclear arms races in both East Asia and the Middle East  then they must be held accountable. The world must stand together to demonstrate that international law is not an empty promise and that treaties will be enforced. We must insist that the future does not belong to fear.  That brings me to the second pillar for our future: the pursuit of peace. The United Nations was born of    09-52179 12  the belief that the people of the world can live their lives  raise their families and resolve their differences peacefully. Yet we know that in too many parts of the world this ideal remains an abstraction — a distant dream. We can either accept that outcome as inevitable and tolerate constant and crippling conflict  or we can recognize that the yearning for peace is universal and reassert our resolve to end conflicts around the world. That effort must begin with an unshakeable determination that the murder of innocent men  women and children will never be tolerated. On this  there can be no dispute.  The violent extremists who promote conflict by distorting faith have discredited and isolated themselves. They offer nothing but hatred and destruction. In confronting them  America will forge lasting partnerships to target terrorists  share intelligence  coordinate law enforcement and protect our people. We will permit no safe haven for Al-Qaida to launch attacks from Afghanistan or any other nation. We will stand by our friends on the front lines  as we and many nations will do in pledging support for the Pakistani people tomorrow. And we will pursue positive engagement that builds bridges among faiths and new partnerships for opportunity.  Our efforts to promote peace  however  cannot be limited to defeating violent extremists  for the most powerful weapon in our arsenal is the hope of human beings — the belief that the future belongs to those who would build and not destroy; the confidence that conflicts can end and a new day can begin. And that is why we will strengthen our support for effective peacekeeping  while energizing our efforts to prevent conflicts before they take hold.   We will pursue a lasting peace in Sudan  through support for the people of Darfur and the implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement  so that we secure the peace that the Sudanese people deserve.  And in countries ravaged by violence  from Haiti to Congo to East Timor  we will work with the United Nations and other partners to support an enduring peace.  I will also continue to seek a just and lasting peace between Israel  Palestine and the Arab world. We will continue to work on that issue. Yesterday I had a constructive meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Abbas. We have made some progress. Palestinians have strengthened their efforts on security. Israelis have facilitated greater freedom of movement for the Palestinians. As a result of these efforts on both sides  the economy in the West Bank has begun to grow.  But more progress is needed. We continue to call on Palestinians to end incitement against Israel. And we continue to emphasize that America does not accept the legitimacy of continued Israeli settlements.  The time has come to re-launch negotiations — without preconditions — that address the permanent-status issues: security for Israelis and Palestinians  borders  refugees and Jerusalem. The goal is clear: two States living side by side in peace and security: a Jewish State of Israel  with true security for all Israelis  and a viable  independent Palestinian State with contiguous territory that ends the occupation that began in 1967 and realizes the potential of the Palestinian people. As we pursue this goal  we will also pursue peace between Israel and Lebanon  Israel and Syria  and a broader peace between Israel and its many neighbours. In pursuit of that goal  we will develop regional initiatives with multilateral participation  alongside bilateral negotiations.  Now  I am not naive. I know this will be difficult. But all of us — not just the Israelis and the Palestinians  but all of us — must decide whether we are serious about peace  or whether we will only lend it lip-service. To break the old patterns — to break the cycle of insecurity and despair — all of us must say publicly what we would acknowledge in private. The United States does Israel no favours when we fail to couple an unwavering commitment to its security with an insistence that Israel respect the legitimate claims and rights of the Palestinians. And nations within this body do the Palestinians no favours when they choose vitriolic attacks against Israel over a constructive willingness to recognize Israel’s legitimacy and its right to exist in peace and security.  We must remember that the greatest price of this conflict is not paid by us. It is not paid by politicians. It is paid by the Israeli girl in Sderot who closes her eyes in fear that a rocket will take her life in the middle of the night. It is paid by the Palestinian boy in Gaza who has no clean water and no country to call his own. These are all God’s children. And after all the politics and all the posturing  this is about the right of every human being to live with dignity and security. That is a lesson embedded in the three great faiths that call one small slice of Earth the Holy Land. And that is why —   13 09-52179  even though there will be setbacks  and false starts  and tough days — I will not waiver in my pursuit of peace.  Thirdly  we must recognize that in the twenty-first century there will be no peace unless we take responsibility for the preservation of our planet. And I thank the Secretary-General for hosting the summit on climate change yesterday.  The danger posed by climate change cannot be denied. Our responsibility to meet it must not be deferred. If we continue down our current course  every member of this Assembly will see irreversible changes within its borders. Our efforts to end conflicts will be eclipsed by wars over refugees and resources. Development will be devastated by drought and famine. Land that human beings have lived on for millennia will disappear. Future generations will look back and wonder why we refused to act — why we failed to pass on an environment that was worthy of our inheritance.  And that is why the days when America dragged its feet on this issue are over. We will move forward with investments to transform our energy economy  while providing incentives to make clean energy the profitable kind of energy. We will press ahead with deep cuts in emissions to reach the goals that we set for 2020  and eventually 2050. We will continue to promote renewable energy and efficiency — and share new technologies — with countries around the world. And we will seize every opportunity for progress to address this threat in a cooperative effort with the entire world.  Those wealthy nations that did so much damage to the environment in the twentieth century must accept our obligation to lead. But responsibility does not end there. While we must acknowledge the need for differentiated responses  any effort to curb carbon emissions must include the fast-growing carbon emitters who can do more to reduce their air pollution without inhibiting growth. And any effort that fails both to help the poorest nations to adapt to the problems that climate change has already wrought and to help them travel a path of clean development simply will not work.  It is hard to change something as fundamental as how we use energy. I know that. It is even harder to do so in the midst of a global recession. Certainly  it will be tempting to sit back and wait for others to move first. But we cannot make this journey unless we all move forward together. As we head into Copenhagen  let us resolve to focus on what each of us can do for the sake of our common future.  This leads me to the final pillar that must fortify our future: a global economy that advances opportunity for all people.  The world is still recovering from the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. In America  we see the engine of growth beginning to churn  and yet many still struggle to find a job or pay their bills. Across the globe  we find promising signs  but little certainty about what lies ahead. And far too many people in far too many places live through the daily crises that challenge our humanity: the despair of an empty stomach; the thirst brought on by dwindling water supplies; the injustice of a child dying from a treatable disease or a mother losing her life as she gives birth.  In Pittsburgh  we will work with the world’s largest economies to chart a course for growth that is balanced and sustained. That means vigilance to ensure that we do not let up until our people are back to work. That means taking steps to rekindle demand  so that global recovery can be sustained. And that means setting new rules of the road and strengthening regulation for all financial centres  so that we put an end to the greed and the excess and the abuse that led us into this disaster  and prevent a crisis like this from ever happening again.  At a time of such interdependence  we have a moral and pragmatic interest  however  in broader questions of development: the questions of development that existed even before this crisis happened. And so America will continue our historic effort to help people feed themselves. We have set aside $63 billion to carry forward the fight against HIV/AIDS  to end deaths from tuberculosis and malaria  to eradicate polio and to strengthen public health systems. We are joining with other countries to contribute H1N1 vaccines to the World Health Organization. We will integrate more economies into a system of global trade. We will support the Millennium Development Goals and approach next year’s summit with a global plan to make them a reality. And we will set our sights on the eradication of extreme poverty in our time.  Now is the time for all of us to do our part. Growth will not be sustained or shared unless all nations embrace their responsibilities. That means that    09-52179 14  wealthy nations must open their markets to more goods and extend a hand to those with less  while reforming international institutions to give more nations a greater voice. And developing nations must root out the corruption that is an obstacle to progress  for opportunity cannot thrive where individuals are oppressed and businesses have to pay bribes. That is why we will support honest police and independent judges  civil society and a vibrant private sector. Our goal is simple: a global economy in which growth is sustained and opportunity is available to all.  Now  the changes that I have spoken about today will not be easy to make  and they will not be realized simply by leaders like us coming together in forums like this  as useful as that may be. For  as in any assembly of members  real change can only come through the people we represent. That is why we must do the hard work to lay the groundwork for progress in our own capitals. That is where we will build the consensus to end conflicts and to harness technology for peaceful purposes  to change the way we use energy and to promote growth that can be sustained and shared.  I believe that the people of the world want this future for their children. And that is why we must champion those principles that ensure that Governments reflect the will of the people. These principles cannot be afterthoughts. Democracy and human rights are essential to achieving each of the goals that I have discussed today  because Governments of the people and by the people are more likely to act in the broader interests of their own people  rather than the narrow interest of those in power.  The test of our leadership will not be the degree to which we feed the fears and old hatreds of our people. True leadership will not be measured by the ability to muzzle dissent or to intimidate and harass political opponents at home. The people of the world want change. They will not long tolerate those who are on the wrong side of history.  This Organization’s Charter commits each of us “to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights  in the dignity and worth of the human person  in the equal rights of men and women”.  Among those rights is the freedom to speak your mind and worship as you please  the promise of equality of the races and the opportunity for women and girls to pursue their own potential  and the ability of citizens to have a say in how you are governed and to have confidence in the administration of justice. For  just as no nation should be forced to accept the tyranny of another nation  no individual should be forced to accept the tyranny of their own people.  As an African-American  I will never forget that I would not be here today without the steady pursuit of a more perfect union in my country. That guides my belief that no matter how dark the day may seem  transformative change can be forged by those who choose to side with justice. And I pledge that America will always stand with those who stand up for their dignity and their rights — for the student who seeks to learn  the voter who demands to be heard  the innocent who longs to be free and the oppressed who yearns to be equal.  Democracy cannot be imposed on any nation from the outside. Each society must search for its own path  and no path is perfect. Each country will pursue a path rooted in the culture of its people and in its past traditions. And I admit that America has too often been selective in its promotion of democracy. But that does not weaken our commitment; it only reinforces it. There are basic principles that are universal. There are certain truths that are self-evident  and the United States of America will never waiver in our efforts to stand up for the right of people everywhere to determine their own destiny.  Sixty-five years ago  a weary Franklin Roosevelt spoke to the American people in his fourth  and final  inaugural address. After years of war  he sought to sum up the lessons that could be drawn from the terrible suffering and enormous sacrifice that had taken place. We have learned  he said  to be citizens of the world  members of the human community. The United Nations was built by men and women like Roosevelt from every corner of the world — from Africa and Asia  from Europe to the Americas. These architects of international cooperation had an idealism that was anything but naive. It was rooted in the hard-earned lessons of war  rooted in the wisdom that nations could advance their interests by acting together instead of splitting apart.  Now it falls to us  for this institution will be what we make of it. The United Nations does extraordinary good around the world  in feeding the hungry  caring for the sick and mending places that have been broken.   15 09-52179  But it also struggles to enforce its will and to live up to the ideals of its founding. I believe that those imperfections are not a reason to walk away from this institution; they are a calling to redouble our efforts. The United Nations can be a place where we either bicker about outdated grievances or forge common ground; a place where we focus on what drives us apart or what brings us together; a place where we indulge tyranny or a source of moral authority. In short  the United Nations can be an institution that is disconnected from what matters in the lives of our citizens or it can be an indispensable factor in advancing the interests of the people we serve.  We have reached a pivotal moment. The United States stands ready to begin a new chapter of international cooperation  one that recognizes the rights and responsibilities of all nations. And so  with confidence in our cause and with a commitment to our values  we call on all nations to join us in building the future that our people so richly deserve."
"182",7283,"UZB",64,2009,"This session is being held at a time of unprecedented efforts made by States and international institutions to overcome the global financial and economic crisis. Unfortunately  the present state of regional and national anti-crisis programmes and the huge cost of their implementation do not yet guarantee the stabilization of the world financial market  growth of demand and the revival of economic activity in the industrial sphere.  In our opinion  effectively overcoming the global crisis and mitigating its consequences largely depend on the effectiveness and coordination of measures taken within individual States and by the world community as a whole — as well as  in particular  on the development of new rules to regulate financial markets that meet modern requirements  and on ensuring stricter control over the efficient use of enormous State and corporate financial assets by transnational and national banking institutions in order to avoid a new wave of inflation and economic bubbles and a collapse in the commodities and stock markets.  I would like to say a few words about the measures taken in Uzbekistan to mitigate and neutralize the impact of the world financial and economic crisis. Our own model of transition from a centralized plan and ideological system to a free market  which is based on five well-known principles  has played a key role in those measures and in ensuring stability during the 1990s as well as the balanced development of Uzbekistan’s economy. Another element of success is our 2009-2012 anti-crisis programme  which is being carried out at this time.  Thanks to the measures taken  macroeconomic stability  steady annual rates of economic growth averaging 8 to 9 per cent  low rates of inflation  the wide-scale attraction of foreign investments and an increase in the real level of income of the population have been ensured in the country in recent years. For the first half of 2009 and continuing throughout  gross domestic product growth amounted to 8.2 per cent.  From this high rostrum  I would like to speak briefly about problems related to the growing threats to environmental security. Those include not only the threats arising from global warming  but also the serious problems of possible technological accidents and risks posed by gigantic hydropower installations in the region  which could seriously undermine the fragile ecological balance of Central Asia.  We speak of these problems while keeping in mind the human-caused accidents at the world’s largest hydropower stations and hydraulic installations caused by their inadequate design and operation — for example  the accident at the Sayano-Shushenskaya hydropower station in Russia. We who live in Central Asia are seriously concerned about similar large hydro-installations operating today in watersheds of the largest transboundary rivers — the Amu-Darya and the Syr-Darya — and providing water to the populations of all of the countries of the region.  The active manipulation of public opinion and attempts to attract wide-scale investments to build the two newest and largest hydropower stations — Rogun on the Amu-Darya river and Kambarata on the Syr-Darya river — are occurring today without taking into account the fact that the glaciers on the Pamir and Tian Shan mountains  which are the basic sources of water for these rivers  are shrinking every year. In addition  and of particular importance — even without considering the possible tragic consequences of potential technological accidents at these installations — is the knowledge that these territories have seismic ratings ranging from 9 to 10 on the Richter scale and are more prone to strong earthquakes.  In this regard  Uzbekistan will continue to insist that all planned construction of large hydropower installations in Central Asia be implemented only after impartial evaluation by international experts under the auspices of the United Nations in order to avoid possible catastrophic consequences. There is also an urgent need to re-evaluate the existing large hydropower stations on the Amu-Darya and Syr-Darya rivers that were constructed in the Soviet period.  The war in Afghanistan  where tensions are currently growing  is one of the main sources of    09-52604 10  concern to the world community today and in particular of security threats in Central Asia. This problem and ways to resolve it are  without exaggeration  the focus of attention of the world’s largest Powers and the international community today. It is no longer a secret that the Afghan problem  which began 30 years ago  has no military solution. The overwhelming majority of countries involved in settling the conflict agree on this.  It is impossible to improve and radically change the situation in the country without solving such urgent issues as the reconstruction of Afghanistan’s economy  communications and social infrastructure destroyed by war; without involving the Afghan people in this process; without a thoroughly considered and seriously organized negotiation process and the achievement of consensus between the conflicting parties; and without strengthening the vertical power structure.  It is extremely important to pay full respect to the deep historical and ethno-demographic roots of the multinational people of Afghanistan  including the traditional values of Islam and of all confessions  which should be the main condition and guarantee of the negotiating process.  The settlement of the Afghan problem could be facilitated by the creation of the six plus three contact group under the auspices of the United Nations  with the participation of the plenipotentiary representatives of the States neighbouring Afghanistan plus Russia  the United States and NATO. The President of the Republic of Uzbekistan  Islam Karimov  has repeatedly emphasized that the implementation of this initiative involving neighbouring countries would allow the achievement of an accord both in and around Afghanistan.  The interdependence of regional and global problems necessitates close cooperation between the United Nations and such regional structures as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. In its capacity as the current Chair of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization  Uzbekistan intends to intensify interaction between the United Nations and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization by turning the cooperation into a real partnership.   In our opinion  interaction between the United Nations and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization should develop in such priority areas as security and stability and economic  social and humanitarian development  as well as other spheres of mutual interest. We believe that the effective combination of the United Nations great experience and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization’s potential will strengthen regional and international security and promote sustainable development in the countries of the region. In this regard  we call upon Members of the United Nations to support a draft resolution on cooperation between the United Nations and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization  to be considered during the sixty-fourth session of the General Assembly.  In conclusion  I would like to confirm Uzbekistan’s commitment to developing constructive multilateral cooperation within the framework of the United Nations for solving the most topical issues on the international agenda.

"183",7295,"VAT",64,2009,"As you  Sir  assume the presidency of the General Assembly at this sixty-fourth session  my delegation wishes you all the best in your endeavours and looks forward to working with you to address the many challenges facing the global community.  Every year  anticipation surrounds the General Assembly in the hope that Governments will be able to find points of agreement on the persisting problems that afflict humankind and to adopt a common direction for resolving them in a peaceful manner for the well-being of all. Understandably  the deliberations of the preceding session of the General Assembly were dominated by preoccupation with the world financial and economic crisis. It is only fitting that this year delegations have been asked to focus on the theme “Effective responses to global crises: strengthening multilateralism and dialogue among civilizations for international peace  security and development”.  In view of a political and cultural dialogue oriented towards the harmonious evolving of the world economy and of international relations  we would do well to revisit the Preamble of the Charter of the United Nations  where it affirms that “We the peoples of the United Nations determined … to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights  in the dignity and worth of the human person  in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small”.   The various world crises that have intertwined in the past months bring to the discussion presuppositions of thought and principles of individual  social and international behaviour that extend well beyond the financial or economic fields. The idea of producing resources and assets — which is the economy — and strategically managing them — which is politics — without seeking together with the same actions to carry out also the good — which is ethics — has been proven to be a naive or cynical and fatal delusion. The more solid and profound contribution that the General Assembly must make to the solution of international problems lies in promoting the principles contained in the Preamble and in Article 1 of the Charter of this Organization in a manner that such high human and spiritual values serve to renovate the international order from within  where the real crisis lies.  A first element of truth is found precisely in the phrase “We the peoples of the United Nations”. The theme of peace and development  in fact  coincides with that of the relational inclusion of all peoples in the unique community of the human family that is constructed in solidarity. Evident in the various Group of Eight  Group of 20  regional and international meetings  held in parallel with the work of the preceding General Assembly  was the necessity to give legitimacy to the political commitments assumed and to confront them with the thoughts and needs of the entire international community so that the solutions devised would reflect the points of view and the   43 09-53165  expectations of the populations of all continents. That is why efficacious modes must be found to connect the decisions of the various groupings of countries to those of the United Nations  where every nation  with its political and economic weight  can legitimately explain itself in a situation of equality with others.  It is in that context of truth and sincerity that the recent appeal of Pope Benedict XVI can be seen in perspective. As he notes in his encyclical “Charity in Truth”  in the face of the unrelenting growth of global interdependence there is a strongly felt need  even in the midst of a global recession  for an urgent reform of the United Nations  and likewise of economic institutions and international finance  so that the concept of the family of nations can acquire real teeth. Such reform is urgent in order to find innovative ways of implementing the principles of the responsibility to protect and of giving poorer nations an effective voice in shared decision-making.  Admittedly  building the United Nations as a true centre for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of those common ends is an extremely difficult task. The more the interdependence of peoples increases  the more the necessity of the United Nations becomes evident. The need to have an organization capable of responding to the obstacles and increasing complexity of the relations between peoples and nations thus becomes paramount.  As we consider the nature of development and the role of donor and recipient countries  we must always remember that true development necessarily involves an integral respect for human life  which cannot be disconnected from the development of peoples. Unfortunately  in some parts of the world today  development aid seems to be tied rather to the recipient countries’ willingness to adopt programmes that discourage demographic growth by methods and practices disrespectful of human rights and dignity.  In that regard  it is both cynical and unfortunate that frequent attempts continue to be made to export such a mentality to developing countries  as if it were a form of cultural progress or advancement. Yet such a practice is by its nature not one of reciprocity but imposition  and to predicate the decision to give development aid on the acceptance of such policies constitutes an abuse of power.  Every human being has the right to good governance  that is  the right to participate in all social actions  at the national and international level  whether directly or indirectly  as a guarantee for all persons a free and dignified life. At the same time  it is an essential part of that dignity that everyone takes responsibility for his actions and actively respects the dignity of others.  Rights always exist inseparably from responsibilities and duties. This applies to individual men and women and  by analogy  to States  whose true progress and affirmation depends on their capacity to establish and maintain responsible relations with other States and to express a shared responsibility for world problems.  The implementation of the principle of the responsibility to protect  as formulated at the 2005 World Summit and approved by the unanimous consensus of all United Nations Member States  becomes a touchstone of the two enunciated principles of truth in international relations and of global governance.  The recognition of the core objective and indispensability of the dignity of every man and woman ensures that Governments always undertake with every means at their disposal to prevent and combat crimes of genocide  ethnic cleansing and any other crimes against humanity. Thus  by recognizing their interconnected responsibility to protect States will realize the importance of accepting the collaboration of the international community as a means of fulfilling their role of providing responsible sovereignty.  The mechanisms of the United Nations for addressing common security and the prevention of conflicts were developed in response to the threat of total war and nuclear destruction in the second half of the last century  and for this reason alone they deserve perennial historical remembrance. Moreover  the work of peacekeepers have stabilized and ended innumerable local conflicts and have made related reconstruction possible.  Nevertheless  it is well known that the number of conflicts that the United Nations has not been able to resolve remains high and that many of them have become occasions of serious crimes against humanity. That is why the acceptance of the principle of the responsibility to protect and of the underlying truths that guide responsible sovereignty can be the catalyst for the reform of the mechanisms  procedures and representativeness of the Security Council.   09-53165 44   In this context  my delegation would like to recall here the Honduran people  who continue to suffer frustration and hardship from the already too long political upheaval. Once more  the Holy See urges the parties concerned to make every effort to find a prompt solution in view of the good of the people of Honduras.  This session of the General Assembly began with the special Summit on Climate Change  and in December there will be the Copenhagen Climate Conference. The protection of the environment continues to be at the forefront of multilateral activities  because it involves  in consistent form  the destiny of all the nations and the future of every individual man and woman.  Recognition of the double truths of interdependence and personal dignity also requires that environmental issues are taken as a moral imperative and translated into legal rules  capable of protecting our planet and ensuring future generations a healthy and safe environment.  In closing  I would like to say that in these changing times the international community — “we  the peoples” — has the unique chance and responsibility to ensure full implementation of the United Nations Charter and thus greater peace and understanding among nations.

"184",7330,"VCT",64,2009,"At the outset  the Government and people of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines take this opportunity to extend deepest condolences to the people of the Philippines and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the lives tragically lost in the wake of tropical storm Ketsana. Our thoughts  prayers and solidarity are with them as they grapple with that catastrophe.  It is with great pleasure that we welcome Mr. Treki to the leadership of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. His experience and abilities are well known and respected  and he has our full support in the coming year. Indeed  we in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines are particularly pleased that the presidency   09-53165 20  has moved from Nicaragua  a country touched by the Caribbean Sea  to a continent that is the ancestral home of the vast majority of our citizens. We have  in essence  kept the presidency within our extended family. We trust that he will continue the exemplary work of his predecessor  Father Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann  who fearlessly and tirelessly championed the role of the “G-192” in addressing global challenges.  We face many challenges within our international community  but at their most basic  the majority are symptomatic of a single underlying issue: a struggle by the powerful to cling to their dominion long after the legitimate bases of their power have faded. We find ourselves in a world governed by outdated norms and assumptions  and our failure to adapt has wrought disastrous consequences on our peoples.  In his welcome and inspiring maiden statement to the General Assembly last Wednesday  our esteemed brother and friend President Barack Obama of the United States correctly identified the challenges to our multilateral unity as “rooted in a discontent with the status quo” (see ). We wholeheartedly agree and endorse that assessment.   It is a discontent with the status quo of a 63-year-old Security Council  which continues to administer our collective security unchanged and impervious to the logic of a new world. It is a discontent with the role  effectiveness and mandate of the 65-year-old Bretton Woods institutions  which were created in a bygone era to address bygone circumstances. It is a discontent with a 49-year-old blockade on the noble people of our neighbour Cuba  the continued illegal application of which is illogical when viewed through the prism of geopolitics  economics or humanitarianism  and can be successfully explained only by reference to narrow local political considerations.   It is a discontent  even  with the stagnation of efforts to change the status quo in other critical respects: the eight years of unresolved negotiations of the Doha Development Round  the 12 years of the toothless commitments of the Kyoto Protocol  and the seven years of unfulfilled Monterrey Consensus promises to achieve a 0.7 per cent of gross national product for official development assistance  a full 40 years after this modest percentage was first mooted.  Through it all  the geopolitical status quo remains. The structural bases of international interaction are distressingly similar to their decades-old antecedents. Those structures were forged in the fires of World War II  hardened in the frost of the Cold War and entrenched by the legacies of colonialism and exploitation. But World War II has long since ended  the Cold War is relegated to history books  and the reach of formal colonialism continues to recede. The structures spawned by those historical episodes are no longer valid.  Our discontent is born not only of stagnation but also of exclusion. Although we have a seat in this hallowed building  it is often the seat of a spectator in a historical drama. The directors and actors script history not in the General Assembly  but in other rooms and locales  without our input or knowledge. In many significant ways we are attendees  rather than participants  on the international stage.  We are in the midst of a global financial and economic crisis of unparalleled depth and scope. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines played no part in the reckless speculation and corruption that precipitated this crisis  yet the people of our country are hard hit by its effects. Our tourism industry is suffering  remittances are shrinking  foreign direct investment is scarce  and the spectre of unemployment is a real and gathering regional threat. However  we are actively excluded from the solutions to this problem.   Last week  we learned that the Group of 20 (G-20) anointed itself “the premier forum for our international economic cooperation”. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is not a member of the G-20  nor were we consulted on its ascension to the ranks of arbiters of our economic fate. While there is an undeniable logic to a small group of the world’s largest economies meeting informally to thrash out matters that affect only their own large economies  the logic fades in the face of a crisis that has spread rapidly and comprehensively to every corner of the globe.  Additionally  the G-20 faces a serious legitimacy problem. Aside from the Group’s being non-inclusive and unofficial  many of the countries at that table represent the champions of the financial and economic orthodoxies that led the world down the rabbit hole to its current economic malaise.  Further  the G-20’s recent self-congratulatory pronouncements of “mission accomplished” in the   21 09-53165  midst of this economic upheaval are of cold comfort to the suffering peoples and countries of the world. While the G-20 may claim that its actions have “worked”  and claim a “sense of normalcy”  the people of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and our Caribbean region are under no such illusions. The invisible hand of the market is still clasped firmly around the throats of poor people and the developing countries of the world. We see none of the so-called green shoots that populate the fantasies of discredited economic cheerleaders.  Indeed  the seeds sown by this crisis may produce the strange and bitter fruit of increased poverty  suffering and social and political upheaval. The crisis itself  with its disproportionate impact on the poor  will only widen and deepen the yawning gap between developed and developing countries.  It is not merely the economic crisis against which the people of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines continue to struggle heroically. Today  we face the triple threat of being globalized  climatized and stigmatized. We have already been globalized by the World Trade Organization (WTO) out of our trade in bananas  which  until very recently  was the engine of our economic growth. We are on the verge of being climatized out of our reliance on tourism as its development substitute  as climate change wreaks havoc on our weather systems  intensifies our hurricanes  destroys our coral reefs  damages our costal infrastructure and erodes our beaches.  Now  we face being stigmatized out of our transition into financial services  as the G-20  the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and other non-inclusive bodies seek to scapegoat and root out so-called tax havens in a pathetic effort to cast a wide and indiscriminate net of blame across a swath of legitimate and well-regulated countries’ development efforts.  We note the irony of hearing these paternalistic prescriptions from the same countries that are unable to stem corruption and mismanagement within their own borders  where corporations recklessly squander trillions of dollars and a single buccaneer investor can make $50 billion — an amount greater than the combined annual budget expenditures of the entire Caribbean Community subregion — disappear into thin air.  The unholy trinity of exogenous assaults on our development prospects posed by globalization  climatization and stigmatization cannot be ignored  nor can the security threats engendered by the illicit trade in firearms and narcotics. We in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines find ourselves unfortunately located between the supply of and demand for these poisons and weapons  and their deleterious effects rip holes in our cohesive social fabric. The Caribbean  which produces not one single firearm or one single kilo of cocaine  is awash in drugs and guns  and is now the subregion with the world’s highest per capita murder rate.  Our plight cannot be ignored. Indeed  we are heartened that the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime  which inexplicably ended its presence in our region  has now seen fit to reconsider its decision to cede the Caribbean to drug cartels and murderers. We hope that it represents a genuine and generous recommitment to our regional challenges.  As a small archipelagic State  we  more than most  are affected and threatened by the ravages of climate change. We  more than most  recognize the critical importance of a meaningful  measurable and enforceable global compact on climate change. However  we do not simply want to “seal the deal” at Copenhagen  as posited by the sloganeers of the United Nations. We want to seal the right deal  the just deal  and the deal that ensures our continued survival. We most emphatically will not seal a suicide pact that will assure the elimination of small island States and our way of life.  The Alliance of Small Island States has recently issued a declaration that contains what we consider to be the essential contours of any meaningful agreement on climate change. We trust that our blameless position on the front lines of climate change fallout will be considered and respected in the global effort to seal the deal. We cannot  as in the case of the world economy  be excluded in any way from the solutions to a problem that so fundamentally affects us.  The theme of exclusion is equally applicable to our friends in Taiwan. The United Nations and its specialized agencies must find ways to ensure the meaningful participation of the 23 million people of Taiwan. Just as their economic strength has merited inclusion in the WTO and the universality of global health challenges have logically compelled their participation in the World Health Assembly  so too should the global reach of climate change merit their   09-53165 22  meaningful participation in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.  The interconnected networks of global air travel and our shared safety concerns similarly mandate the participation of Taiwan in the International Civil Aviation Organization. The Government and people of Taiwan have advanced a reasonable and responsible policy of engagement to usher a new era in cross-strait relations. The international community can and should encourage and reward this fledgling rapprochement with meaningful participation in the relevant specialized agencies.  Any cursory analysis of the excluded and the included  of the discontented and the defenders of the status quo  will quickly reveal that many current inequities are rooted in our colonial history and that the struggle for geopolitical balance and inclusiveness is indeed the last struggle of decolonization as we  the former colonial territories  remain excluded from the inner sanctums and power structures that were established by and for the colonizers in a time long since passed.  On 27 October this year  Saint Vincent and the Grenadines will celebrate its thirtieth anniversary of independence. However  we recognize that independence is a process  not a one-time event. Our independence journey continues today. Thirty years after gaining formal independence  we retain the Queen as our Head of State  and our highest judicial appeals travel from our shores to the United Kingdom to be decided by Her Majesty in Council. While we cherish a special  modern and respectful relationship with the United Kingdom  we do not intend to tarry on colonial premises a moment longer than is necessary.  Even as we wage a wider war of attrition against geopolitical colonialism  our citizens are preparing to vote on a new and home-grown constitution that will break the chains of outmoded dependence and place Saint Vincent and the Grenadines firmly on its two feet as a truly independent republic. This new proposed constitution  the product of six years of open  transparent and inclusive public consultations  is testament to the political maturity of our people and to the value of locally tailored solutions to externally imposed impediments.  In a similar manner  our brothers and sisters in the developing world  including Cuba  the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela  Turkey  Mexico  Malaysia  Iran  Libya  Brazil and many others  have forged new links and bonds of friendship  cooperation and solidarity with our country that go beyond historical  geographical or colonial linkages. We value these friendships and partnerships as important additions to our traditional and treasured allies in the United States  the United Kingdom  Taiwan  Canada and the European Union.  Just as our myriad bilateral friendships and partnerships span geographic  economic and ideological divides  so too must our multilateral cooperation be inclusive and participatory. We can no longer maintain the illusion of holding hands in artificial solidarity across the moats and turrets of structural and systemic inequalities. Modern multilateralism cannot proceed on the bases of the included and the excluded  of the political haves and have-nots  nor can token assimilations of individual developing countries serve to mask the necessity for deep structural changes to existing power arrangements.   We urge our brothers and sisters who have gained limited access to the halls of power to not only be a voice for their excluded brothers and to not only remember where they came from  but also to view themselves as the tip of the spear  the thin edge of the wedge that will use their newfound privileges to dismantle these structures from within  even as we continue to make our presence felt outside the citadels of stasis and indifference.  Psalm 118 of the Bible teaches that the stone that the builder rejected shall become the cornerstone. We  the poor and developing countries of the world  are the stones that the builders of this body refused and ignored. In rebuilding and revitalizing  either we will become the cornerstones of this institution  or this edifice of multilateral cooperation will crumble into irrelevance and illegitimacy.  Addressing the economic crisis  poverty and development is not an academic exercise. Climate change is not a theoretical event. Reform of global governance is not a diplomatic parlour game. They are the clear and present dangers of our time  and they reflect the need for the real and inclusive participation of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  the Caribbean and the developing world. They represent also a need to reflect and address our discontent with the status quo perpetuated for far too long.   23 09-53165   We stand now in the autumn of our discontent  but  as Gandhi said  “Healthy discontent is the prelude to progress”. The challenge of the discontented is to rise above ancient animosities and artificial balkanization to achieve the clarity of vision  unity of purpose and political will to finally and successfully storm the castles of stagnation and status quo and to drive our peoples  our politics and our planet into a new era of genuine inclusiveness  equity and meaningful  people-centred progress."
"185",7377,"VEN",64,2009,"I greet all the citizens of the world who have come here — as they do every year — for this gathering of such great importance for the world. I am very pleased to be back in New York and at the United Nations following a few years’ absence. I am very grateful for all the cooperation and the manner in which our delegation has been received.   Last night we visited Lincoln Center to see a film made by Oliver Stone during the past year. The title of the film already stirs your thoughts. It is called “South of the Border”. In this film  you can see President Evo Morales chewing coca leaves  together with Oliver Stone. And  as President Morales says  coca is not the same as cocaine. You can see Cristina  the President of Argentina  and the automobile of General Perón. You can hear what she has to say about events in South America  in Latin America. And you can see Lula  the President of Brazil  in the Guajira region of Venezuela  working with us to help the indigenous peoples  who were exploited for centuries  through core industrial projects. You will see President Fernando Lugo  a bishop and liberation theologian  living today in the residence occupied for many years by Stroessner. And you can see how a bishop became a president.   You can also see Rafael Correa  the President of Ecuador  in Havana with President Raúl Castro. You can see Fidel. You can even see Obama  in Trinidad  chatting with a group of us  with his hand held out to us and an open smile.  I think it is an interesting film  one of the many made by this great filmmaker of the United States  Oliver Stone. He had already made two films about Fidel  “Looking for Fidel” and “El Comandante”. There is a lot in this film  many messages that could help us to decipher the enigmas of the times in which we live.   We stayed behind after the film was over last night  chatting with a group of people from the United States and other parts of the world. And this contact was very instructive and very symptomatic of the importance of what Fidel calls “the battle of ideas”. A lady in her fifties came up to me and said “I am very happy”. She was a North American  very white; a typical United States citizen  born in this country  but she spoke some Spanish. She told me  “I am very    09-52425 2  happy”. And I asked her why. “Because  now having seen this movie  I realize what you are. I thought you were a very bad person”.   This person was a victim of the hostile media bombardment  the ideological bombardment  of the United States and of the entire world  whose aim is to turn reality inside out and to turn the world upside down  as Eduardo Galeano put it.  The film is called “South of the Border” and I am taking advantage of this opportunity and that title to tell you that  south of the border  a revolution is under way. A revolution is under way in South America. A revolution is under way in Latin America. There is a revolution in the Caribbean. The world must see this  it must truly realize this and accept it  because it is a reality and it is not going to change. What is more  this is a revolution that goes beyond ideology. It is a geographical and geopolitical revolution. It is a historic revolution; it is part of our times. It has very deep roots. It is a total  moral and spiritual revolution. And we believe that it is a necessary revolution. This revolution is great in both spirit and magnitude  and it is going to keep growing as the days  months and years go by. And why is it great? It is great because it has been a long time coming: centuries of history have led up to this moment in time. It is great in terms of the space that it covers.  I am not going to speak any longer than  Mr. Al-Qadhafi. Al-Qadhafi has said everything there is to say. This applause is for Al-Qadhafi and his speech. But nor will I speak any less than Mr. Obama  or Lula.   I was explaining why this revolution is great. First  because of time  the accumulated time that has gone by. It is centuries  centuries of battles  of struggles  of hopes  of suffering of millions and millions of human beings in Latin America and the Caribbean. This revolution is great in the area it covers. This revolution is great in the depth of its foundations. This revolution is great in the masses of people that are joining it. No one seeks to slow it down and no one will be able to.  Yesterday  it was said by President Morales here (see )  by this great companion and indigenous leader of the Aymara  Evo Morales. He also said it in the film  which you should not miss  “South of the Border”. Oliver Stone told me last night that pressure is already being exerted to prevent the American people from seeing it. Where is their freedom of expression? It is just a movie. How can they be afraid of a movie? But there is already pressure from the monopolies that run the film industry  that operate the theatres — these are all monopolies and they are putting on pressure. But the movie will be shown elsewhere. Fortunately  we are in the age of computers and telecommunications. We no longer depend on movie theatres run by monopolies.   In the film  Evo  speaking with Oliver Stone  recalls a phrase pronounced by a great leader of the Aymara  an ancestor of his who was murdered  just one of the many millions that were murdered by the Spanish  Portuguese and English invasion  by the European invasion of our continent. I know that all present are aware that when the European ships arrived at the American shores there were approximately 90 million indigenous people living here.   Two hundred years later only four million survived. This is one of the greatest genocides in history — the genocide of the continent itself  of the Abya Yala  as our indigenous people call it. So Evo in the movie repeats the sentence uttered by this great Aymara leader  who was drawn and quartered — he was tied to four horses by the arms and legs and he was torn apart  and as he died the Indian uttered a prophesy: “Today I die ” said Túpac Katari  “today I die  but one day I will return as millions.” Túpac Katari has returned  and we are millions. We are millions.  Nothing and no one can hold back the great South American  Latin American  Caribbean revolution. And I think the world should support it. The United States should support it. Europe should support it  because this revolution — some brothers and sisters may not have noticed — is the start of the road to salvation for this planet  and to salvation for the human race  threatened as it is by capitalism  imperialism  hunger and war. This is the necessary revolution. For centuries this has been called “the New World”. Now we can truly call it “a new world”.  Years ago — as we recalled last night — I was invited to a conversation — a large group of important leaders. They were important in their own right. They were trade union leaders here in the United States. Some workers were complaining about a biscuit factory that was not paying them. They were striking  and one of them asked me  “Why don’t you buy that factory?” And I said  “I’ll see. Maybe we can make it a   3 09-52425  socialist biscuit factory  if Obama gives me permission. Maybe we could do that — buy it  give it to the workers  let them make the crackers and distribute them. Why should there just be one or two capitalists exploiting a lot of people?” That is socialism and that is the path to salvation for this planet.  Yesterday a journalist asked me — after the movie there was forum at which he asked me — “Do you defend socialism even though the Soviet Union failed?” The reply is very simple. The Soviet Union lost its way early on. There was never real socialism in the Soviet Union. But this century  the twenty-first century  will be the century of socialism — the socialism of the human race.   I’m sure everyone listening to me has read Einstein. Albert Einstein convinced the American President to build the atomic bomb — to begin the research before the Nazis did. Then later he regretted what he had done when he saw the disaster of Hiroshima and the disaster of Nagasaki. But Albert Einstein  after all his years of study  the great scientist  among the greatest scientists ever to have walked the Earth  came to the conclusion — and this is written in his own hand — “Why socialism?” Einstein came to the conclusion that the only way for the human race to live on this planet is socialism. Capitalism is the road to extinction of the human species. We as a species have only been around for what? This is Castro territory  he knows these figures. But  whereas life first appeared here at least three billion years ago  we the human species only appeared maybe less than 300 000 years ago  hardly 0.01 per cent of the time that life has existed on this planet. So we appear after so long and we’re going to wipe out life on this planet?  We’ve heard it from everybody — Obama  Lula  Cristina Fernández  Al-Qadhafi  Sarkozy — everyone said the same thing. They have all clamoured for change. And what is the change? Capitalism allows no change. Let us not fool ourselves. It’s only through socialism that we can bring about genuine change. And the revolution in Latin America has it all and it has a strong socialist element. As Mariátequi  the great Peruvian thinker said  it is an Indian-American socialism. It is our own socialism. It is a Bolivarian socialism. It is a José Martí socialism. It is a new socialism. It has not been copied from anybody else. There are no manuals for socialism  said Mariátequi. It is a heroic creation that has to be constantly reinvented.  Yesterday we were remembering what a North American President  that is to say a United States President  said shortly before he was assassinated  and this is on the record  in a speech before the United States Congress. John Kennedy spoke of a revolution in the South  saying that the principal cause was hunger. Only a few days later he was assassinated. John Kennedy was not a revolutionary  but he was an intelligent man  just as I think President Obama is an intelligent man. And I hope God protects Obama from the bullets that killed Kennedy. I hope Obama will be able to look and see — genuinely see — what has to be seen. It does not smell of sulphur here anymore. That smell has gone. It smells of something else — it smells of hope. And you have to have hope in your heart and believe in the hope.   We cannot destroy this planet. What about our children? What about future generations? Come  let’s take on the challenge. Lula was saying yesterday that there was no political will. Those words were whips. I know Lula’s will. I am deeply aware of his humane attitude. He is a true brother of mine  and he was right to say what he said. But I would not exactly say that there is no political will. I would say rather that some political will is lacking  because Lula has it and we have it  but it has to be increased. It has to continue to grow in the leaders  in society  among the people  among the youth — particularly in the hearts of the young — and the workers  everywhere in the world.   Kennedy said it: there is a revolution in the South. And he added  “Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable”. Jack Kennedy said that. You can find it on the Internet; you can find everything on the Internet.  My dear Maria Fernanda Espinosa  once ambassador from fraternal Ecuador  whom I have not seen for days. We’d like to say hello to President Correa. The ambassador was Minister for Foreign Affairs at the beginning of the citizens’ revolution  with Correa leading the people of Ecuador  the people of Manuela Saenz and Bolivar and Eloy Alfaro  the noble and great people in Bolivia and that whole area.  Some are trying to block the path to our peaceful revolution. And there’s another brave woman  Patricia Rodas  the Foreign Minister of Honduras; please  a hand for this brave Central American woman  from the people of Morazán. Long live Honduras! Long live Morazán! And long live the dignity of the people!     09-52425 4   At 1 p.m. exactly  I was jotting down these notes — I don’t have much farther to go  Mr. President; don’t anybody throw a shoe at me. The Cuban Minister has taken off his shoe to throw it at me. He had some rubber shoes — if you are going to throw me a shoe  throw one of those. I spoke to Manuel Zelaya at 1 p.m. sharp; I remember it was 1 p.m. sharp — we started at 1 and finished at 1.13.  While we are here  comrades of the world  there is a President  firm  dignified  who with a small group of people  almost martyrs  was able to escape those trying to carry out a coup d’état. The perpetrators of the coup had brought repression to the Plaza Morazán in Tegucigalpa and had taken every single road. They had an entire army; it was as if they had invaded Honduras with their own army — what an indignity. From here I make an appeal — I  who am a revolutionary soldier — to the soldiers of Honduras  to the sons of Morazán to not continue to repress an innocent people.  While we are here  Manuel Zelaya  the President of Honduras  is in the Brazilian embassy  which has given him refuge. According to what the President has told me  there are more than 200 soldiers surrounding the embassy in the most brutal fashion. Were they trying to go back to the Stone Age? It will not work. Is that what the perpetrators of the coup d’état had in mind? They will be swept away by the wind of the new age. The coup cannot succeed  these regressive forces cannot have their way  not in Honduras  not in any of the countries of the Americas. These people have been out in the streets for 90 days  resisting  resisting  resisting.  So  there we have a President  firm in his conviction  with a group of compatriots  with his wife  the First Lady. Apparently they are not letting food through; the water is cut off every now and then. Luckily there is a cistern with water. This morning they were able to get some of the most up-to-date telephone interception equipment  which the President told me is an Israeli brand. Israel has recognized the coup d’état Government; I think it is the only country in the world that has. They have all kinds of equipment to block signals and jam communications  and they are also trying to create panic among the few people inside the Brazilian embassy  threatening them with incursion into the embassy. Does the Assembly realize how retrograde this is? It is like some kind of trolls or dark giants or magicians  something from the age of the cavemen. But they will not return.  The people are in the street  protesting. The airport is closed now. Who is behind the coup d’état? It is the Honduran bourgeoisie; the State is taken over by the bourgeoisie  by the rich. Four or five wealthy  powerful families own the State. I think we have to pull out our copies of Lenin  his State and Revolution  where he talks about the bourgeois State  the control of everything by the bourgeois State including the national congress  the judiciary  the army.  The people are in the street  but they are being fired on. Yesterday the President told me that he knows of at least three people in the vicinity of the Brazilian embassy who were killed. And the President is asking for dialogue  so as to return to the road to democracy. So let us send the expression of our strongest solidarity to the people of Honduras and President Zelaya  and let us ask that the United Nations resolution be complied with  and the resolution of the Organization of American States.  The United States Government — and this is strange — has not recognized that a military coup d’état has occurred. President Zelaya told me today that there is some friction between the State Department and the Pentagon. Yesterday I was reading Pentagonism  a book by the great Dominican author Juan Bosch  who was overthrown by imperialism. The Pentagon is the imperial cave. They do not want Obama. They do not want change. They want to dominate the world with their military bases  with all their threats  their bombs  their soldiers and bases.  The Pentagon is behind the coup in Honduras. President Zelaya was dragged out of his home  out of his bed  at dawn on 28 June  taken to a plane  bundled up by Honduran soldiers under command from the United States base there  in Palmerola. The plane took off from Tegucigalpa and landed at the Palmerola base. They held the Honduran President there for some time. Then they decided to take him to Costa Rica. The American military in Honduras knew about the coup; they supported it. They supported the Honduran military. Hence the contradictions that Obama has to face.  At times we wonder if are there two Obamas — the one who spoke here yesterday and the other — a double? The one who supports  or allows his military to support  the coup on Honduras? I want to present   5 09-52425  this question for thought. Is there one Obama  or are there two? Let us hope the one we heard yesterday will prevail. That is what the world needs; that is what the world is calling for.  What is the backdrop of the coup in Honduras? It has to do with everything we are talking about here — it is the revolution of the South. It is not the kind of revolution where there are columns of guerrillas  heroes such as in the Sierra Maestra  heroes of the high mountains of Bolivia  where Ernesto Che Guevara was.  But this is not that kind of revolution. This revolution is different. It does not break out in the mountains with guerrilla groups. No  it starts in the towns among the masses. It is a mass revolution  but it is peaceful and wants to remain peaceful. It is democratic  deeply democratic.  Do not be afraid of democracy. Here  I am paraphrasing Noam Chomsky in another wonderful work that I did not know until I obtained the book in Madrid a few days ago. I went to visit my friend  the King of Spain  mainly because an Ibero-American summit was coming up in Portugal  and I said that I would go if he did not tell me to shut up. He told me that he would not. So  I am going. King Juan Carlos and I are great friends. I went to a recommended bookshop — La Casa del Libro — in Madrid  and I got Chomsky’s book Fear of Democracy. We should all read that book  Fear of Democracy.   The elite are afraid of the people. They are afraid of true democracy  which Abraham Lincoln  another martyr  defined very clearly in three ideas: democracy is government of the people  by the people and for the people. It is not government of the bourgeoisie or of the elite when the people rise up and the thugs are pushed out. That happened in Honduras  and in Venezuela in 2002. It happened in Brazil with João Goulart  and in the Dominican Republic. Why were the peoples of Latin America and of the Caribbean not allowed to build their own future in the twentieth century? They did not let them.   This century is ours. This century  in Latin America and in the Caribbean we will build our own way and no one can stop it. No one can stop it. Imperialism must end. At times  one wonders. I was once asking Lula what America  our Latin America  would be today if the Governments of the United States had not dug their claws into our America to impose a model by violently cutting off the hope and the struggle of millions of people  extinguishing the dawn.  I was born in 1954. Fidel was already in prison  and they were dropping bombs in Guatemala. They invaded the Guatemala of Jacobo Árbenz Guzmán; and then the Bay of Pigs  although they failed there; then this revolutionary Cuba — admirable  but blockaded.   I call on Obama to lift the blockade on Cuba. What is he waiting for? Let him do what he says. Or are there two Obamas? Yesterday  Obama said  and I noted it — here  I noted down Lula  who spoke before Obama  and then I noted Obama’s words — that a political system cannot be imposed on any people and that each people and its sovereignty must be respected. Then what is President Obama waiting for to order the lifting of the brutal and murderous blockade on Cuba? Does anyone have doubts about that? Does anyone think that it is rhetorical? No. There is persecution against businesses in any part of the world that provide even food to Cuba  and now also to Venezuela.   Not long ago  Fidel Castro mentioned in one of his reflections that a company known throughout the world that manufactures and supplies medical equipment did not meet its obligations to the Governments of Cuba or of Venezuela this past year or the one before. They did not send the spare parts for hundreds of pieces of medical equipment that the two Governments had bought to bring free quality health care to our peoples. These include 64-row CT scanners and electrocardiogram machines that are now in the poor areas of Caracas. Where the indigenous people live  there are medical facilities. We have 30 000 Cuban doctors there and a free  good health-care system for the people. We tried to quietly find solutions with the company — Philips — but the company has refused to send the spare parts for that high-tech equipment. Why? Under pressure from whom? From the Government of the United States? Is it this Obama or another Obama? Is it Obama one or Obama two? Who are you  Obama? Who are you? I want to believe in yesterday’s Obama  whom I saw here  but these things keep happening  and they affect the lives of millions of human beings. Why? In whose name? Why does the United States continue to do that?  It is fear of democracy  just as happened in Honduras. It is the fear of the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas that rises up as a new and innovative mechanism of solidarity  and we have brought into line    09-52425 6  the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of our Americas and the Governments and the countries of Cuba  Nicaragua  Honduras  Venezuela  Ecuador  Bolivia  Antigua and Barbuda  Dominica and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. They attack us and try to stop us  but they will not succeed. The Common Market of the South and the Union of South American Nations are being set up and are all part of the great historic Latin American geographic and geopolitical revolution.   Along the same lines are the seven military bases that the United States is going to establish in Colombia. Yesterday  Obama spoke — I have it noted here — about four pillars. Everyone remembers that. So let us accomplish that. I take him at his word. We take the President of the United States at his word: nuclear non-proliferation  agreed? They could begin by destroying all the nuclear weapons that they have. Then go ahead and destroy them.   Obama’s second pillar — the first was non-proliferation — is the pursuit of peace. So  President Obama  let us pursue peace in Colombia  in dear sister Colombia. There is a civil war in Colombia. That some do not want to acknowledge it is another matter. There is a long-standing  historical conflict in Colombia. The United Nations must acknowledge it and consider it  and we all should extend a hand to Colombia  while of course respecting its sovereignty  to pull it from and help it out of that tragedy that that brother people is experiencing.  I remember that I mentioned that peace to Obama in front of Lula in Trinidad and Tobago at the Summit of the Americas. Let us seek peace in Colombia. If only peace were achieved in Central America  in Guatemala. When I was an active soldier  I was in Guatemala. That was war. It was war  with thousands and thousands dead and disappeared. Look at El Salvador and Nicaragua. And now Daniel Ortega is back in Government after almost 20 years. The Sandinista people brought him back.  What is good for the goose is good for the gander. Farabundo Martí and the people of El Salvador brought President Funés to the presidency of that sister republic. Peace was achieved — I know President Arias is here — and if peace was achieved in Central America  my God  why can peace not be achieved in Colombia? This is one of the greatest desires of my life. I am Venezuelan  but I feel like a Colombian — the Colombia of Bolivar  the Colombia of Miranda  our Colombia.   Is President Obama thinking of seeking peace — his second pillar — with seven more military bases in Colombia? These seven bases are a threat  not only for the possible peace in Colombia but for peace in South America. We are right — we the Governments of South America — to have said  each in our own way and in our own degree of intensity  how concerned we are about the installation of these seven American military bases on Colombian territory. I would like to denounce it and point it out. I ask President Obama to think about it and that he apply his pillars.  Let us promote peace. The United Nations could set up a peace commission in Colombia or Venezuela. Naturally  we would cooperate  I am sure  all countries that want peace. We do not want any more war among ourselves.  I will skip some pages. There is another topic that Fidel touches upon in his 21 September thoughts. It has to do with climate change. I am going to take another two minutes  Mr. President  to insist on this point. Some people think this is a metaphysical concern  it is for intellectuals. No  we are destroying our planet. As a reputable Venezuelan journalist has said  this rocket we are travelling on — because this planet is like a rocket ship — we are destroying it.   Fidel says  in his piece entitled “A species in danger of extinction”  from 21 September 2009  “At the international environmental conference held by the United Nations in Rio de Janeiro” — that was in 1992; I remember because I was in jail at the time — “I stated  as the then head of the Cuban State  ‘A species is in danger of extinction — man’”. Fidel goes on to say:    “When I uttered and backed up those words  received and applauded by the heads of State in attendance — including the President of the United States  a Bush less dismal than his son George W. — they still believed that they had several centuries to confront the problem. I myself” — Fidel — “did not envision a date any closer than 60 or 80 years.   “Today we are dealing with a truly imminent danger and its effects are already visible.   7 09-52425    “Average temperatures have increased 0.8 degrees centigrade since 1980.”  That is scientific data  according to the NASA Institute for Space Studies — 0.8 degrees in the last almost 30 years. Fidel continues     “The last two decades of the twentieth century were the warmest in hundreds of years. The temperatures in Alaska  the Canadian west and eastern Russia have gone up at a pace that doubles the world average. Arctic ice has been quickly disappearing and the region can experience its first completely ice-free summer as soon as the year 2040. The effects are visible in the 2-kilometre-high masses of ice melting in Greenland  the South American glaciers  from Ecuador all the way to Cape Horn  fundamental sources of water  and the gigantic ice cap covering the extensive area of Antarctica.    “Current carbon dioxide concentrations have reached the equivalent of 380 parts per million  a figure surpassing the natural range of the last 650 000 years.”  We are destroying our planet. We must be aware of this  and we must act  as Lula stated at the 3rd meeting yesterday. With respect to climate change  Lula said there is no will. The most developed countries do not want to take decisions. But Obama says they do. But we are told that the United States is going to take some decisions. Please do  Mr. President  do that. But now is time to move from words to action. Let us save this planet. Let us save the human race.   Let us hope that the summit in Denmark in December will produce decisions  truly forceful ones. Venezuela is willing to accept those decisions. Venezuela calls on everyone to take decisions proportionate to the extent of their responsibility.   Now  what is the basic cause of this contamination? It is hyper-consumption. We are exhausting the petroleum  gas and other fossil fuel reserves. Reserves that accumulated over millions of years are being burned in a single century  in less than a century.   And that of course has to do with the economy. I shall not read this document  Mr. President; I shall merely refer to it. It is the Stiglitz report. I invite the Assembly to analyse it. Yesterday the President of France also invited the Assembly to analyse it. It is thanks to him that the report of the Stiglitz Commission exists. But it is nothing more than a mere gesture.   The report contains 12 recommendations of the Stiglitz Commission. Let us assess them. I think that they address the substance  although they do not question the capitalist model. We socialists do question that model  but let us talk about it  let us find consensus solutions for the circumstances and later for the medium and long terms.   In its recommendations  the Stiglitz report says  first  that we should look at income and consumption to assess material well-being. Second  it recommends prioritizing the family perspective; third  taking into account the heritage; fourth  giving more importance to redistribution of income beyond the average. Fifth  it recommends expanding indicators of non-commercial activities. For example  certain services such as child care  bricklaying  plumbing and carpentry appear in national accounts only if they are carried out by a salaried person.   Delegates know that this has to do with accounting for gross domestic product (GDP). These are merely capitalist mechanisms. According to the report  the following is certain: the GDP rises with traffic  while the anxiety of the people also rises  just as the unhappiness of passers-by and passengers in traffic rises as they lost precious time in the traffic.   The GDP rises. Why is it rising? It is rising because more gasoline is consumed. Moreover  pollution increases. We know why. The capitalist world has created measuring methods for the economy that are destructive. That is why I think the Stiglitz report offers important considerations. Here  in its second point  it says that we should establish a battery of indicators for the environment and for climate change.  Turning to the economy  this report is very timely. Let us now adopt it  and above all  Governments  particularly Governments of the most developed countries — I think they are meeting in Pittsburgh today  not as the Pittsburgh Pirates  but as Presidents of the Group of 20 — should discuss it. Tomorrow I will ask Lula and Cristina how the meeting went  because they are coming to Caracas on their way to Margarita Island for the Africa-South American summit.     09-52425 8   The economy  the economy  the economy. We are in favour of socialism  but let us discuss it and talk about indicators and methods and modes of production. As President Obama said yesterday with regards to his fourth pillar  we need an economy that serves human beings. Well  President Obama  that is called socialism. Come over to the side of socialism  President Obama  come join the axis of evil and we will build an economy that truly serves human beings. It is impossible to do that with capitalism. Capitalism only benefits a minority and excludes the majority. Besides  it destroys the environment and destroys lives. That is capitalism.  Finally — and I think I have now been speaking for my allotted 10 minutes — I will end with a phrase of Lula’s. He was the first speaker in the Assembly yesterday. He said there is no political will. I have already commented on that  and I would add to it because I know Lula and I know exactly what he said to us. He is calling upon all of us to strengthen political will.  Unlike other Governments elsewhere  which have doubts and do not want to change despite the terrible crisis in which we are living  we in southern America have a lot of political will — here I am speaking for Venezuela and  I know  also for South America  for Latin America — a tremendous political will for true change.   I recommend this book by István Mészáros  a great Hungarian philosopher and thinker who has been a professor at various universities in London for many years: Beyond Capital: Toward a Theory of Transition. I think the book is among the greatest writings of the twentieth century. It is a complete renewal of socialist theory. In one of the interesting chapters Mészáros quotes another great person  Karl Marx. We must not be afraid of Karl Marx — he was the Einstein of politics. Yes  he was demonized  but Karl Marx was right about so many things.  Quoting Marx  Mészáros says in this book that crises act as a general threat and thus urgently lead us beyond presuppositions towards a new historic paradigm. We need a new historic paradigm. For years we have been hearing about a new world  but what actually exists is this old  moribund order. We need the new order to be born  the new historic paradigm  the new political paradigm  a new global paradigm. Yesterday Al-Qadhafi said here that we need a new institutionalism  a new economy  a new society  but truly new — a world that is new.   Now  I think Lula said yesterday — he finished speaking at 10:10 in the morning — that we must become the midwives of history. I agree. I would add to what Lula said. Has the birth already started? The birth is not a future event; it is here. Let us be  as Comrade Lula said  midwives of the new history  prevailing over those who would bury it. Let us struggle on the planet for the birth of this new history  this new time  this new multi-polar  free world  this economy at the service of all people  not of minorities  this world of peace.   I am a Christian. One day Christ said  “My kingdom is not of this world.” It is of a future world  the reign of love among us  where we can truly live as brothers and sisters.  Last Sunday in Havana — and I will put my little books away and I will wind up now — on the Plaza de la Revolución there was a great concert  the “Concert for Peace”  with Miguel Bosé  Juanes  Olga Tañó and Cuban singers. Silvio Rodríguez was there — the Great Silvio — and they sang to the whole world. Some people in Miami went crazy and tried to destroy Juanes’ CDs — that great Colombian — just because he had gone to sing on the Plaza of the Revolution. How crazy can you get? Fortunately they are a minority. Silvio was there with his guitar  and I am sure he sang  “This era is giving birth to a heart”. He ends his song  Cita Con Angeles  like this: “Let us be a tiny bit better and a little less selfish.”  Cheers!"
"186",7416,"VNM",64,2009,"On behalf of the Vietnamese delegation  I wish to congratulate you  Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki  on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. I believe that with your rich experience  you will lead the Assembly at this session to great success. Viet Nam commends you  Sir  for the theme you proposed for this high-level general debate  namely  effective responses to global crises — strengthening multilateralism and dialogue among civilizations for international peace  security and development.  I further wish to express our high appreciation to His Excellency Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann for his contributions to the work of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session.  The year since the Assembly’s sixty-third session has not been a long span of time  yet it has been characterized by the many challenges it brought to the entire international community. Every part of the world has suffered from the negative and far-reaching impacts of the global financial crisis and economic downturn. That further aggravates the challenges in terms of food security  energy security and climate change facing developing countries in particular. In the meantime  tension and conflicts persist in various regions  and the threats of the proliferation of weapons   17 09-52470  of mass destruction and of international terrorism continue to demand effective responses.  Because of all this  the past year has also witnessed enormous efforts on the part of the international community  both in thinking and in action  not only to address the immediate problems but also to create a more sustainable foundation for common peace and prosperity. In due course  nations have been able to draw valuable lessons on governance over domestic development and to gain a fuller understanding of the meaning of multilateral cooperation. It is evident that no single country could respond to the financial and economic crisis and to the series of current global challenges. It is equally evident that policies and measures of imposition and unilateral use of force to address international security and political issues would only result in more tension  confrontation and impasse.  Given the many difficulties at the present time  we are encouraged by recent positive — although not solid — signals from the world economy. The first summit of the Security Council on nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament has highlighted the question of disarmament on the international agenda. Viet Nam recognizes the active contributions of the United Nations and the Secretary-General in the furtherance of discussions on and direct support for the implementation of concrete measures in relation to issues of international concern. In this connection  Viet Nam hopes that this Assembly will focus its deliberations on the following issues.  Respect for the fundamental principles of international law and the United Nations Charter in international relations is the determining factor for peace and security and a prerequisite for all the activities undertaken by the international community. On that basis  the United Nations should continue to make active contributions to easing tension and peacefully resolving outstanding disputes and conflicts  including those relating to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and Iran.   It is Viet Nam’s hope that early progress will be made in the negotiations for a peaceful  comprehensive  just and lasting solution in the Middle East on the basis of ensuring the fundamental national rights of the Palestinian people and the legitimate interests of all parties concerned. We fully support the national reconciliation and reconstruction process in Afghanistan and Iraq and strongly condemn terrorist acts against civilians in those countries and in other places in the world. We oppose the unilateral use of economic sanctions against developing countries and support the General Assembly resolutions on the necessity of immediately ending the economic  commercial and financial embargo imposed against Cuba.  An effective and comprehensive response to today’s economic and financial crisis is the top concern of the international community. In the immediate term  that includes urgent measures to curb the pace of the downturn  encourage an early recovery of the world economy and minimize the negative impacts of the crisis  particularly on the realization of the Millennium Development Goals in developing countries.   In the long run  the response will embrace considerations of development paradigms suitable for individual nations and reforms of the international system of economic relations  which has for quite a while shown many irrationalities. It is also imperative to promote the role of the United Nations in designing international strategies and mechanisms to address the energy and food crisis  pandemics and climate change  including issues to be discussed at the Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen this December.  The United Nations reform process should also continue to meet the emerging  complex requirements. Viet Nam shares the common view that reform should be undertaken in all United Nations agencies  with Security Council reform conducted in such a way as to broaden its representation and render its operational methodology more democratic and transparent. Efforts to reform the machinery should go hand in hand with efforts to renew content and to pay due attention to the balance among the fields of activity of the United Nations. United Nations operations should also be provided with sufficient resources.  Next year  Member States will commemorate the sixty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations  while also reviewing the Organization’s activities and the 10-year implementation of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). To prepare the ground for recommendations to be submitted to the leaders of Member States at the sixty-fifth session  we need to discuss what lessons can be drawn from United Nations activities in all spheres  what activities should be prioritized and what conditions are necessary for the    09-52470 18  Organization fully to carry out its mandates and functions in the interest of all nations.  In the recent past  Viet Nam has continued to record major achievements in the process of renewal  in general  and initial positive gains in response to the impact of the global economic and financial crisis  in particular. We have also been successful in our foreign policy  which is based on openness and strives to diversify and ensure the multilateral character of our external relations in the spirit of being a friend and reliable partner of all nations and an active  constructive  cooperative and responsible member of the international community.  As a non-permanent member of the Security Council  we have been an active participant in and an effective and responsible contributor to the maintenance of world peace and security. As a peace-loving nation  Viet Nam always strongly supports and contributes to the peaceful settlement of international disputes and conflicts  the fight against transnational crime and international terrorism  and the promotion of disarmament and the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. As a country that experienced decades of war with devastating consequences  including the long-term effects of the Agent Orange toxic chemical  and as a country that has made important achievements in development  Viet Nam has always striven towards the effective Security Council action in supporting reconstruction efforts in countries emerging from conflict.  In its work  Viet Nam sets high store by consultation and cooperation with other members of the Security Council and the United Nations  as shown by our initiative to consult Member States on the latest annual report of the Security Council. I would like to take this opportunity to express our sincere gratitude and appreciation to all Member States for their cooperation  without which Viet Nam would not have accomplished this undertaking.  In the future  Viet Nam will continue to work actively for world peace  stability  cooperation and development  thus contributing to efforts of the United Nations and the international community in accelerating the resolution of social issues and global challenges  as well as the implementation of development programmes and the Delivering as One initiative.  This session of the General Assembly is taking place at a crucial juncture. During 2009  the world has witnessed many significant changes  which have demanded corresponding policy decisions from us. I believe that only by standing shoulder to shoulder to enhance multilateral cooperation can we  as responsible leaders  meet the expectations and aspirations of our peoples and map out a path for the long-term development of the United Nations. Viet Nam will always be a supportive  active and responsible participant in this noble mission."
"187",7447,"VUT",64,2009,"I begin by joining others in congratulating Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki on assuming the noble and high responsibility of the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. Let me wish him well in his leadership as the United Nations makes its way through the myriad evolving challenges on the global agenda. I also take this opportunity to commend the Secretary-General for his vision and for the initiatives that he has resolutely pursued in the interests of all humanity.  The theme of the sixty-fourth General Assembly session will serve to focus the attention of the international community on the critical importance of building partnerships for more equitable and sustainable development. My delegation shares the belief that sustainable development is the responsibility of everyone  and that its realization requires strong partnerships at all levels. I firmly believe that equity and sustainable development are mutually reinforcing goals  for it would be difficult to support peace  security and growth in any process of development that left much of humanity behind.   One of the major goals of my country’s comprehensive reform programme  introduced during the mid-1990s  is to promote social equity  especially in terms of integrating the needs of our culturally diverse people and geographically remote communities into our national development priorities. I am glad to say that we are still pursuing our nationwide policy consultation processes  aimed at developing and maintaining sound policies and frameworks for delivering services to our people at the grass-roots level.  We in the Pacific are grateful to all our development partners for their continuing support and their commitment to working closely with us in developing mechanisms for strengthening development coordination  improving development outcomes  using available resources effectively and ensuring inclusiveness in our approach to development.  We are very much aware of the fact that despite continued high levels of development assistance over many years  the economic and development performance of island States in the Pacific region remains weak. Many countries in our region  including Vanuatu  are not on track to achieve all the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015. Vanuatu will therefore remain firmly committed to the principles of the Cairns Compact on Strengthening Development Coordination in the Pacific. We are committed to working closely with the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat and other multilateral agencies to ensure that all resources made available to the region are focused on the aim of achieving real progress towards the MDGs. We are also committed to work with our individual donor partners to ensure that they support our national development priorities that are linked to our overall efforts to achieve the MDGs.  However  Vanuatu is aware that commitments to strengthening development coordination in the Pacific region are being made against the backdrop of the global economic crisis. My delegation therefore wishes to renew our call to international financial institutions to assist Pacific island countries in responding to the international economic crisis. Vanuatu is very concerned that its recent high economic growth performance  which rose above 6 per cent between 2006 and 2007  will fall sharply as a result of the global economic recession. International Monetary Fund and Asian Development Bank growth estimates forecast that Vanuatu’s economy will grow at a slower   41 09-52470  pace in 2008 and 2009  averaging between 3 and 4 per cent. Growth prospects for the future continue to be uncertain. Maintaining strong economic growth over the next few years will be critical if Vanuatu is to succeed in sustained delivery of such basic services as education  health and infrastructure development to its 80 scattered islands.  In the light of these concerns Vanuatu is pleased that in February 2010 it will be hosting a Pacific-United Nations Conference on The Human Face of the Global Economic Crisis in the Pacific. Discussions of the organizational arrangements for this important event are under way between my Government  United Nations specialized agencies actively engaged in the Pacific region and Pacific regional organizations. We all look forward to the outcome of the conference  especially in terms of guidance and support for building Pacific regional partnerships that can assist us in addressing the impacts of this and future global economic crises on the livelihoods of our people.  The complex and challenging circumstances in Fiji have led to international condemnation and pressure for early elections to be held. Further international pressure has been brought to bear on the Government of Fiji in view of more recent developments. While Vanuatu is part of the Pacific-wide regional calls for an early return of democracy in Fiji  my Government believes that continued engagement of the Fiji Government by the international community will be critical. Under Vanuatu’s chairmanship  the Melanesian Spearhead Group has continued to maintain high-level dialogue with the Government of Fiji  primarily to ascertain that Government’s views and to put forward the concerns of neighbouring States.  Vanuatu welcomes the recent establishment of a full-fledged department to oversee the implementation of the framework for change that the Fiji Government introduced recently and to facilitate a nationwide process of reconciliation and dialogue. As the closest neighbouring island State  Vanuatu continues to plead that the process of returning Fiji to democracy and parliamentary legitimacy should be driven by peaceful dialogue and genuine concern for the socio-economic well-being of the people of Fiji. Any punitive measures would not be in the economic and social interest of the good people of Fiji or the region of the Pacific as a whole. We are all too aware of the unprecedented challenges that small island developing States like Vanuatu have come to be faced with today. Man-made or linked with such phenomena as climate change  these challenges pose unacceptable implications for the social  economic and political structures of our small island States and often have grave security implications.  Vanuatu would like at this juncture cordially to applaud the tireless and collective efforts of all the island nations  large and small  in cooperating and working together towards the adoption by the General Assembly this past June of resolution 63/281 on climate change and its possible security implications. This is indeed a historical milestone for Pacific small island developing States  such as my own country  because for the first time the security implications of climate change were brought to the attention of the international community. Over the years differing and conflicting views have stalled the strenuous efforts of the small island countries in convincing the world that the impact of climate change was irreversible. Inherent in many of the arguments that needed to be overcome was the idea that there was still time.  At this point I wish to reiterate that the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change must be the principal forum for addressing climate change. Given our vulnerabilities and geographic realities  we in the Pacific region have been among the first fully to accept the security implications of climate change. I would like to stress here that no country  small or large  developed or developing  will be able to avoid the security implications of climate change  which are already affecting the livelihoods of our people  as the international community struggles to come to terms with the idea that climate change poses a real threat to the future survival of mankind. Unless all the relevant organs of the United Nations intensify their efforts to consider and address the issue of climate change  no word will be more appropriate to the global situation under this particular crisis than the word “doomed”. The momentum seen today forces upon us the realization that these threats are real and therefore require urgent attention.  In preparations for the coming conference in Copenhagen  leaders of the Alliance of Small Island States have agreed this week that more action is required from members of the international community in living up to their commitments. While globalization and interdependency have brought with them both opportunities and challenges for the small island    09-52470 42  States  the challenges predominate and are ominous. The gathering of world leaders at the Summit on Climate Change at this year’s General Assembly was a reaffirmation that climate change presents a security threat to all our nations and peoples.  Consisting of volcanic and coral islands  Vanuatu is one of the smaller island nations in the South Pacific region and in the world. Because of Vanuatu’s rapidly growing young population and low economic growth rate  the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) assessment  until very recently  ranked it as one of the poorest countries in the South Pacific region. This degree of underdevelopment drastically limits its capacity to effectively curb threats associated with the adverse impacts of climate change.  More than 80 per cent of the people of Vanuatu live off the land through subsistence farming  which constitutes their contribution to the national economy. Vanuatuan traditional farming practices have been shaped by farmers’ subsistence needs and climatic conditions. Land has always been precious to the Ni-Vanuatu; rights to its ownership and use form a central part of their culture and traditional governance. The rapidly growing population of Vanuatu places increasing pressure on access to a finite amount of farmland. This issue is likely to be compounded by probable losses of arable land owing to the adverse effects of climate change. Such possible losses raise serious economic  political and security implications for Vanuatu.  Not only is Vanuatu among the least developed countries  but it remains one of the most disaster-prone nations among the small island States. It is highly susceptible to cyclones  coastal erosion  river flooding  earthquakes  landslides  tsunamis and volcanic eruptions.  Without doubt these are challenging times. We followed with great interest the recent Conference on the World Financial and Economic Crisis and Its Impact on Development. Vanuatu is deeply concerned that the world financial crisis  like climate change  is caused by external forces beyond our control  and yet its rippling effects are quickly reaching our nation’s most vulnerable populations. Children  women  the disabled and the working poor will be the hardest hit and the least able to cope with dramatic changes.  Vanuatu is indeed being hurt by a variety of economic realities  such as decreasing trade  erratic commodity prices  increased borrowing costs and strains on official development assistance. One of the reasons for this downturn is that we are quite dependent on external financing  in the form of both aid and trade. Furthermore our foreign-exchange earnings and our Government revenue rely on a small number of commodities. However  we are confident that we will be able to counteract those weaknesses in our economic situation by introducing progressive microeconomic policy mechanisms  improving Government structures and striving to maintain political stability. This plan is in line with working to implement the Millennium Development Goals and to achieve country targets by the year 2015.  Vanuatu emphatically concurs with the premise of the upcoming Copenhagen conference that climate change is one of the most fundamental challenges ever to confront humanity. No issue is more fundamental to long-term global prosperity  and no issue is more essential to our survival as a species. I strongly feel that a fair and comprehensive global deal in Copenhagen will represent a step forward for all us  for nations small or large  developing or developed. Mutual cooperation  respect and trust will be the key political driving forces for a successful deal in Copenhagen.  While we commend recent efforts to reform the United Nations  Vanuatu shares the view of many other countries that to ensure a stronger and more effective Organization we need to reconsider the membership of the Security Council sooner rather than later. If the Council’s membership better reflected the world’s geography and better represented currently underrepresented groups  the United Nations would build a stronger sense of common responsibility and collective responsiveness. A more representative Council would bring openness and transparency  create confidence and ameliorate understanding and cooperation.  Still  any reform must be implemented in a way that does not affect the authority of the Council. Of course there are diverse vested interests among us. But our common interests and the United Nations role in furthering them must continue to hold a central place to ensure the continuity of the international legal framework. Negotiations must therefore be conducted in an atmosphere of inclusion and through constructive dialogue and positive engagement. Diatribes offer no solutions. We must remain resolute in our defence of   43 09-52470  the United Nations; the necessity of this Organization is continuously made clear by the horrors that the scourges of armed conflict  disease and famine inflict on people  especially women and children.  On a more administrative level  the highly bureaucratic procedures and accession mechanisms established by the United Nations system for much needed funds have placed unnecessary strain on local capacities. As the burgeoning climate crisis looms on the horizon we need to identify ways of simplifying procedures  such as those for accessing climate change mitigation funds  and to consider revising delivery modalities  including exploring direct access possibilities. The blueprint for international cooperation may be in place but it must be followed up by action.  Finally  my delegation welcomes Security Council resolution 1887 (2009) on non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and disarmament. The presence of all the leaders of the Permanent Five at the meeting (see S/PV.6191) demonstrates a commitment to control the spread of weapons of mass destruction. Maintaining international peace and security will always remain humanity’s greatest challenge  and there is hope.  Despite all our differences and diversities  human security for all is our main objective. We recognize the efforts of the Secretary-General and commend the manner in which he has pursued the mobilization of political momentum for Copenhagen with the relevant bodies of the United Nations. Saving the Earth and humanity remains our ultimate goal.  In conclusion  we go to Copenhagen with optimism. The future is in our hands. Let us not deprive future generations of their right to live in a world of peace and stability."
"188",7479,"WSM",64,2009,"The value of the United Nations to humanity has not diminished with the passing of time. Our Organization remains as relevant today as when it was established 64 years ago. Its status as the world’s pre-eminent body will be diminished if we as leaders do not accord it the respect our Organization deserves and observe its etiquette.  Recent crises have not only validated our global sustainability  but highlighted our interconnectedness and interdependence. These crises  from those in food and energy security to the global recession and pandemic  have adversely affected all Member States to varying degrees. Although they have resulted from the decisions and actions of a few  the crises have not differentiated in impact between developed and developing countries or between the rich and the poor. The costs of these crises in terms of human suffering and social upheaval have been considerable  and justifiably required the collective and concerted global action that now seems to be working with a good degree of success.   19 09-52586   These crises are eminently solvable and short-term when compared to the great and grave threat the world faces from environmental degradation and climate change. This week’s summit of the Alliance of Small Island States and the Secretary-General’s high-level meeting both underscored the predominance and urgency of the climate change challenge. Their core messages were unambiguous. Climate change is not a future phenomenon; it is real and already occurring in Pacific countries and low-lying islands elsewhere. It is no longer a question of when  but rather of how severe the magnitude of its impact will be. The full cost society must bear is becoming a stark reality that we can no longer ignore today.  Climate change is not a concern of small island developing States alone. Our vulnerability to climate change should not absolve those responsible for its causes in the past or now  nor should it be used to shift the burden of leadership and responsibility away from the main carbon emitters. Developed and emerging economies will all be affected one way or another. Sadly  the human and financial costs will be borne disproportionately by small island developing States.  A Copenhagen climate pact is therefore a must. It requires a new brand of cooperation and a broad outlook. The narrow pursuit of self-interests and the use of economic and political expediencies should be set aside and must not be allowed to derail the goal of concluding an ambitious and binding agreement. Climate change is also everyone’s job. While acknowledging historical responsibility is legitimate  allowing it to get in the way of making decisions to reach a comprehensive agreement would be a grave mistake. Reaching a climate change agreement is therefore a test of multilateral solidarity.   Time is running out. The impacts of climate change are getting worse daily. Playing the blame-and-shame game  or waiting to be led but not being willing to lead  are no longer options. For no single nation  no single group of nations and no single organization can win the war against climate change on its own. The divergent yet inextricably linked interests of Member States demand that we seal a deal in Copenhagen.  The cost of adaptation and mitigation at the national level can be prohibitive because most of our people and infrastructure are found along the coastal areas. Relocating them inland would be costly due to our rough and rugged terrain and the number of people involved. However  that has not deterred us. Using our resources and by partnering with the international community  we continue to support the global effort to build our resilience against climate change. Our plantation access roads programme is one such initiative. It facilitates relocation and helps boost agricultural production as a response measure to climate change and to food security.  The shadow of the financial crisis envelops us still. As with climate change  most developing nations are victims forcibly drawn into the maelstrom of the crisis through its consequential impact on the global economy. Although remote from the epicentres of the crises  our small and vulnerable island economies have not been spared. Indeed  it has been acknowledged by the Group of 20 that the global recession impacts the vulnerable and poorest countries disproportionately. International acceptance of the collective responsibility to provide assistance to help those countries mitigate the impact of the global recession has also been very important.  That undertaking to provide assistance is simply critical for small and open economies like that of my country. The global recession has contracted our small economy  and our narrow Government revenue base has taken some hard hits that have made it impossible to provide on our own the kind of stimulus package that would meaningfully mitigate the impacts of the recession  let alone reignite growth in the economy.   In the circumstances  the effective assistance needed by our economy at this time is direct budgetary support  which should be necessary only for the short term to sustain expenditure  allow us breathing space to rebalance our finances  and put the economy back onto the path of growth. We acknowledge with appreciation the readiness of our development partners and of international financial institutions  such as the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank  to sympathetically consider our requests in that regard.  Samoa will graduate from the list of least developed countries in December 2010. The intervention of the financial crisis was unanticipated and not taken into account when the decision was made to advance our country to the transitional period. An extension of the transitional period is therefore both necessary and justified.  The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) will be reviewed next year. Our scorecard on all eight    09-52586 20  Goals gives us guarded optimism  although meeting every one of them in the time frame allowed remains a challenge. Our needs are not matched by the resources at our disposal. Hence  central to our efforts to realize the MDGs is the implementation of Goal 8 on achieving durable global partnerships for development. But some aid donors either take their time to respond or do not do so at all. That is cause for justifiable alarm because if they are not forthcoming with relatively modest resources to help us achieve the MDGs  then the prospects for an effective global response to climate change will all but vanish.  The Pacific is a region of relative peace. We have been spared the scars of war and conflict  and nature has gifted us the sea and land for our livelihood. While we have challenges and differences  they tend to be localized. Our development needs  individually and regionally  are modest by world standards. However  belying that tranquillity is our acute economic vulnerability.  Given our credentials as a region of relative stability with needs that are not as large as those of other parts of the world  one would expect the international donor community to be jostling for opportunities to assist our development efforts. On the contrary  that has not been borne out in the general experience of the region. Some development partners seem unconcerned as to where and how their development aid is spent; whether it is in war-torn  devastated and unstable regions or as a front to support military-related industries at home appears to be of no consequence. Then  there are those who engage in posturing and rhetoric that are devoid of tangible or real action on the ground.  Sustainable partnership is based on mutual trust and respect. That has been the foundation of Samoa’s relationship with our main development partners: Australia  China  the European Union  Japan and New Zealand. All have supported us and continue to do so at every step of our development journey. Italy  Austria and Turkey are our newest partners  assisting in the renewable energy field  and we would like to engage countries at the cutting edge of renewable energy technology  such as China  Germany  Japan and the United States  to assist us in that key sector.   The One United Nations Initiative is a timely project that reduces the costs and improves the efficiency and effectiveness of aid delivery by the United Nations system. Resources saved through that Initiative should flow back to benefit Member States.  A permanent solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict continues to be an elusive goal  and seems a lost cause. President Obama’s relaunching afresh this week of the stalled Middle East peace talks will hopefully be the catalyst that brings about renewed impetus in achieving a secure State of Israel living alongside a Palestinian State.  Mr. Christian (Ghana)  Vice-President  took the Chair.  International terrorism is a global menace. It creates an atmosphere of collective fear and intolerance. It preys on the innocent  vulnerable and defenceless and disrupts any progress towards peace and development. Terrorism in all its forms and manifestations should always be condemned unreservedly. Individual actions by States cannot in and of themselves provide a solution. We must shoulder our responsibility to act together to meet the threat through concerted multilateral action  which underpins the spirit of our Organization.  Wars are futile and serve no useful purpose. They will not end unless disarmament  nuclear non-proliferation and illicit small arms and light weapons are brought under effective control. The task of building peace lies with every nation. That is why we welcome the decision by the United States to move forward with the ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. We remain hopeful that the Treaty will enter into force soon.  The United Nations cannot survive unless it constantly adjusts and adapts to changing times. After 18 years  Security Council reform has finally entered the intergovernmental negotiating process. Samoa continues to support the expansion of the membership of the Council in both the permanent and non-permanent categories. Countries such as Japan have the credentials to assume permanent member status.  United Nations peacekeeping operations around the world have brought relief and hope to victims in conflict areas. Samoan civilian police officers are currently serving in three peacekeeping missions side by side with officers from other Member States. In our own region  Samoa is a contributor to the Regional   21 09-52586  Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands under the umbrella of the Pacific Islands Forum.  Let me conclude by wishing the President well in the formidable challenges facing his presidency. When nations stand united and firm in pursuit of the goals of the Organization’s Charter  the world can look to the future with confidence."
"189",7525,"YEM",64,2009,"At the outset  Mr. Treki  permit me on behalf of Yemen and on my own account to congratulate you on your well-deserved election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. I am confident that your long experience in the area of diplomacy  in particular Arab and African diplomacy  will ensure your skilful and able conduct of our proceedings. I wish you every success in carrying out your noble mission. I also wish to congratulate Father Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann  President of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session  on his efforts  which ensured the success of the various Main Committees of the Assembly. In addition  I thank the Secretary-General for his tireless efforts to consolidate international peace and security and advance the work of the Organization.  The Republic of Yemen is facing complex socio-political and development challenges  to which a number of factors have contributed  including the world financial crisis and its impact on Yemen’s economy  as well as an acute shortage of resources as a result of declining oil production and low prices on international markets. We also face a growing population  combined with water shortages and limited commitments by our development partners to help us combat poverty by providing employment opportunities and decent livelihoods for the Yemeni population. Despite those difficulties  the Yemeni citizen has the smallest share of official development assistance when compared with citizens of other least developed countries. Undoubtedly  lack of development and rising unemployment and poverty   7 09-52604  rates have created many challenges and difficulties for our Government.   The Government also faces other challenges  including  in particular  the rebellion by the Al-Hothi elements in the Sa´ada governorate  who abandoned the Zaidi doctrine  which is the second most prevalent religious sect in Yemen  to embrace the beliefs of the Shi´ite Twelvers sect. Although they had the right to do so as Yemenis  they exploited it to gain Shi´ite support and sympathy after they had carried out an armed rebellion against the Government. These subversive groups have committed terrorist and violent acts against citizens  targeted State institutions and facilities and hampered the work of local councils  calling for changes in our democratic republican system in order to return Yemen to the days before the 26 September revolution. The Government has been compelled to deal with these destructive groups  channelling a portion of its limited resources allocated for development towards fighting the saboteurs and re-establishing governmental authority and the rule of law throughout Yemen. The destructive acts carried out by these rebellious groups before the recent military operations against them caused the displacement of tens of thousands of citizens from areas affected by violence  which has recently increased as a result of military clashes.   As a result of its concern about the situation of internally displaced persons (IDPs)  the Yemeni Government has addressed that humanitarian situation responsibly and in cooperation and coordination with international and civil society humanitarian relief organizations  providing secure camps and meeting the needs of IDPs for food and health care. Here  I wish to recall that our Government has declared two cessations of hostilities during the most recent military operations  the second of which was in response to the appeal made by the Secretary-General and humanitarian and international organizations for the opening of safe corridors for the provision of relief to refugees. However  the saboteurs exploited that ceasefire by increasing their attacks on our military forces  cutting off roads  planting mines and spreading false rumours about Government forces attacking the IDPs. The Government has established a committee to investigate the situation  although it is aware that there was no IDP camp in the area but rather a camp used as a supply centre and meeting place by the saboteurs  who have violated five previous agreements and returned to violent actions.   I wish to highlight our commitment to the principles of guaranteeing human rights  protecting civilians from the effects of military operations and upholding the sovereignty of the Constitution and the rule of law in dealing with an internal situation caused by a group that is committing violent and terrorist acts in violation of the law and the Constitution.  This challenge is growing  as can be seen from the activities of Al-Qaida elements in Yemen and their attempts to consolidate their presence in Yemen and to target our country and other States in the region. Al-Qaida is supporting the saboteurs in Sa´ada  seeking to make their acts of violence and rebellion serve the interests of Al-Qaida in Yemen and to spread anarchy and instability. This highlights the need for continued Yemeni efforts to uproot terrorism and for continued international coordination among security and intelligence organs  so that extremism and terrorism can be defeated.  Meanwhile  a number of separatist elements are exploiting the atmosphere of democracy and freedom of thought and expression  the Government’s respect for human rights  and economic difficulties and a low standard of living to promote their separatist agenda — which was rejected by the Yemeni people in 1994 — in an invitation to reject constitutional legitimacy and to conspire against the unity  security and stability of Yemen.   The level of expenditure required for our Government to impose the rule of law and combat terrorism has reduced the number of employment opportunities  decent livelihoods and educational opportunities for our young people and the chance to fight poverty. Therefore  we urge the international community  donor countries  international organizations and Yemen’s partners to join an international alliance to combat terrorism. Once again  we call upon them to shoulder their responsibilities and provide generous support to Yemen in order to strengthen our development programmes to combat poverty and provide job opportunities  since development and economic growth are important elements in combating terrorism  reducing unemployment and achieving development. From this rostrum  we call on Yemen’s partners and donors to    09-52604 8  fulfil the pledges that they made at the November 2006 London conference in support of development.  The Republic of Yemen continues to strengthen the democratic principles of its political system  reflected in political pluralism  the peaceful handover of authority  freedom of expression  respect for human rights  growing decentralization  building local government with broad powers  electoral and constitutional reform and improving partnerships with civil society organizations. Those involved in political work in Yemen agreed to postpone for two years the parliamentary elections that were to be held next April in order to reform the election law and to introduce some constitutional changes with a view to reforming governance. For its part  the Government has introduced a system of broad local government involving the election rather than the appointment of governors with a view to bringing about further decentralization of authority.   The difficult humanitarian situation of the Palestinian people under Israeli occupation should remind all in this Hall that the international community has failed to secure the legitimate demands of the Palestinian people and to assist it in establishing its own State  and that it has ignored the suffering of the Palestinian people  the systematic violation of their human rights and the increase in illegal settlement activities in the occupied Palestinian territories. The unjust blockade imposed on the Palestinians in Gaza makes life a tragedy for the entire population of Gaza owing to the complete disregard of the practices of the Israeli occupation in violation of the relevant international resolutions and instruments  and in the light of the recalcitrance shown by the Israeli Government and its rejection of all initiatives aimed at moving the peace process forward  in particular with regard to the course adopted by the United States Administration to resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict. We call upon our Palestinian brothers to show a spirit of national responsibility towards their people living under the yoke of occupation by unifying and putting an end to their differences so as to benefit the Palestinian issue and achieve their goals.  The situation in Somalia calls for the international community to take more effective measures to achieve peace and security and to rebuild the institutions of the Somali State by urging the Transitional Federal Government to act in such a way as to contribute to the strengthening of peace and stability in the Horn of Africa. Here  we welcome the efforts of the Transitional Federal Government to secure peace and to extend its administration throughout Somali territory. However  it urgently needs further support to enable it to serve the Somali people. We call on all Somali parties without exception to end their differences  to participate in national dialogue and to achieve reconciliation  putting the interests of the Somali people above all else.   We call on the external parties to stop interfering in Somalia’s internal affairs. Instability in Somalia is adversely affecting all States of the region. The phenomenon of piracy and the increasing flow of refugees to neighbouring States  resulting from the instability in Somalia  are creating socio-economic and health difficulties for Yemen  as it bears the burden of caring for hundreds of thousands of those refugees. We call on the international community to help the Somali coast guard to protect the coasts and international maritime trade.  With regard to the situation in the Sudan and in Darfur  we welcome the mediation efforts of Qatar  Libya and Egypt to achieve peace in the Sudan. We support the efforts of the international community in bringing about the reconciliation of all opposing factions  and we reiterate our call for the decision of the International Criminal Court with regard to President Omer Al-Bashir to be overturned as it does not respect the sovereignty of the Sudan and hinders the efforts for peace in the Sudan.   Yemen condemns all acts of terrorism to which the Iraqi people are subjected  and we call on them to overcome their differences and to strengthen their national unity.   Yemen welcomes the efforts of the Secretary-General towards reforming the Organization. We reaffirm our position that the United Nations and its system should be reformed in order to achieve equitable representation and a better decision-making process that places the required emphasis on development  fighting pandemics  easing poverty and addressing environmental issues  which have a direct impact on the standard of living of millions of people. We must strive to bolster the Security Council’s role in the maintenance of international peace and security; at the same time we must reform the Council and expand it to make it more representative  ensure that its deliberations are more transparent and rationalize the   9 09-52604  use of the veto so as to avoid its abuse and double standards.  In conclusion  on behalf of the Government of Yemen  I would like to extend our appreciation for the good work of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in managing this Organization and in improving its work. I reiterate my congratulations to you  Mr. President  and wish you every success. "
"190",7563,"YUG",64,2009,"The United Nations is the only universal institution that unites us all as a global community of independent States. At the very heart of this indispensable Organization stands the General Assembly  the only place in the world where the sovereign voices of all countries are given an equal  legitimate say in the future course of mankind.  Safeguarding the principles of the United Nations Charter remains much more important than the policies of any single nation  especially during transformative periods such as this. The international system seems to be undergoing a paradigm shift that  in many ways  is comparable in scope to those that occurred in 1945 and 1989.  No one is yet able to reliably predict how deep the change will turn out to be. What is becoming evident is that interrelated factors — the most recent of which is the global economic crisis — have caused the arrival of a new set of circumstances on the world stage. A broad repositioning appears to be taking place. The global balance of power is shifting as new financial models compete for primacy. All in all  international relations are becoming less predictable.   Achieving consensus on fundamental issues that affect us all has never been more important. As United Nations Member States  it is incumbent upon us to work more closely together to reaffirm the rules that govern the international system  to reinforce the territorial integrity of Member States  to entrench interdependence and to complete the transition from the old order  based on political and economic domination  to one established on equitable cooperation among all nations.  That is the only way to build a future of global peace  stability and prosperity. It is the only way to enhance the dialogue among civilizations  to make multilateralism more effective and to provide for sustainable development and eradicate poverty throughout the world. And it is the only way to effectively fight terrorism and cross-border organized crime and to promote nuclear disarmament.  We must also work more in concert with one another to combat the effects of climate change. That    09-52470 2  will continue to be strongly emphasized over the course of Serbia’s two-year presidency of the Governing Council of the United Nations Environmental Programme. As part of our efforts  we have proposed the establishment of a regional climate change centre in Belgrade  Serbia.  As a responsible global citizen  we have underlined the necessity of agreeing on a fair and balanced emissions reduction scheme and  in particular  on a new comprehensive climate agreement — one that will secure eco-friendly investments  stimulate innovation and facilitate the global spread of technologies  knowledge and experience.   In short  working towards a “green economy” will decisively contribute to placing the whole world firmly on the path towards a cleaner  more sustainable path.  How we conduct ourselves at this time of great transformation will constitute a precedent with far-reaching consequences for generations to come. Simply put  we are at a point of decision: will we choose a world in which there are no rules as exceptions become the new norms  devoid of any meaning except “might makes right”? Or will we opt to solidify the great gains achieved when the principles of an equitable international order were embodied in the United Nations Charter?  I believe that only the latter alternative provides a future that all United Nations Member States can work in concert to bring about. The starting point remains universal respect for international law. No one should be above it  no one should stand beyond its reach and no one should feel at liberty to declare an exception to its jurisdiction and scope. And yet that is precisely what was recently attempted.  I come before the Assembly as the President of a country that is trapped at the centre of one of the most dangerous challenges to the universality of the international system since the founding of the United Nations. I speak of UDI — the unilateral declaration of independence by the ethnic Albanian authorities of Serbia’s southern province of Kosovo and Metohija. This attempt at secession stands in direct violation of Serbia’s democratic Constitution  as well as the basic principles of the United Nations Charter  the Helsinki Final Act and Security Council resolution 1244 (1999).  Some say Kosovo’s unilateral declaration of independence is a unique case. But in truth it is an attempt to forcibly partition a Member State of the United Nations against its will and without regard for the firm opposition of the Security Council. It is an attempt to impose a nineteenth-century outcome on a twenty-first century challenge. Serbia will never  under any circumstances  implicitly or explicitly  recognize the unilateral declaration of independence of the ethnic Albanian authorities of our southern province.  We will continue to vigorously defend our integrity in a non-confrontational manner  using all peaceful means at our disposal. That is why  at the very outset of this grave crisis  Serbia ruled out the use of force. We chose to respond to Kosovo with the utmost responsibility and restraint. Serbia opted for a diplomatic approach  the result of which is that a vast majority of United Nations Member States have refrained from recognizing the unilateral declaration of independence in Kosovo and have continued to abide by their Charter obligation to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of my country. On behalf of the Republic of Serbia  allow me once again to sincerely thank these countries for their adherence to the principles of international law.  While categorically rejecting violence and unilateralism  Serbia has been equally emphatic in demanding that justice be delivered through the proper legal means at the disposal of any United Nations Member State. As part of our constructive approach  we decided to contest the issue of Kosovo’s unilateral declaration of independence before the principal judicial organ of the United Nations  the International Court of Justice  which was tasked by General Assembly resolution 63/3 with issuing an advisory opinion on whether that declaration is in accordance with international law. I would like to take this opportunity to inform the Member States that the Court has concluded the preliminary  written phase of its proceedings in the case. Public hearings are scheduled to begin on 1 December  with a decision by the Court expected sometime next year.  Let me express my sincere gratitude to all those countries that have chosen to actively support Serbia’s strategic choice to transfer the Kosovo issue to the judicial arena. The case marks the first time in the history of the Court that it has been asked to consider the legality of an attempt at secession by an ethnic group from a United Nations Member State. There is   3 09-52470  no doubt that the Court’s conclusions will constitute a powerful legal precedent  with overarching consequences for the United Nations system. The outcome will either strongly deter other separatist movements from attempting to secede  or produce a result that could encourage them to act in a similar fashion. Plainly stated  should Kosovo’s unilateral declaration of independence be allowed to stand  a door would open for challenging the territorial integrity of any United Nations Member State.  The uniquely important nature of this case has been acknowledged by the international community. As we know  all five permanent members of the Security Council have confirmed their participation in the public hearings before the International Court of Justice. It is in this context that I appeal to all Member States to respect the fact that the Court continues to be actively engaged on the issue. Its deliberations should not be prejudged and its work should not be obstructed. The Court’s proceedings have to be allowed to run their course without political pressure  such as any further recognition of Kosovo’s unilateral declaration of independence. On behalf of the Republic of Serbia  I encourage all non-recognizing Member States to stay the course. By maintaining respect for my country’s sovereignty and territorial integrity  together we will help ensure that international law continues to close in on the issue of unilateral declarations of independence.  Serbia’s decision to turn to the International Court of Justice to contest the Kosovo issue has been complemented by a policy of constructive engagement with all legitimate actors on the ground in Kosovo. We maintain support for a reconfigured United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and its continuing indispensability. We have also welcomed a status-neutral European Union Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo (EULEX)  working in our southern province on the basis of Security Council resolution 1244 (1999)  which continues to operate under the overall authority of the United Nations. I call on all responsible stakeholders invested in the future of Kosovo to work more closely with the Government of Serbia on implementing in full the Secretary-General’s six-point plan (S/2008/354  annex I)  which was welcomed by the Security Council in November 2008.  This is a time for leadership and working together  not for increasing the divide. We all have our constraints  and they should be respected. Let us create new opportunities for achieving practical results  by engaging with one another on a host of concrete questions for the benefit of all residents of Kosovo province  including the Serbs — the community most at risk in all of Europe. (spoke in French)  Democracy in Serbia is sound; our society rests on a solid foundation and our values have been strongly confirmed by law. The basis of our strategic approach to national development is the call for all European nations to share their common destiny. On many occasions our actions  in very difficult circumstances  have proved our determination to become a member of the European Union (EU). Despite setbacks  our core strategic priority remains that of attaining EU membership  not merely on grounds of geography  heritage or economic prosperity  but also because of the essential values that we share. These are values that proclaim soft power in foreign policy and the primacy of law in domestic affairs; achieving consensus in Brussels and standards of human rights throughout the EU. These are values that proclaim freedom of movement for all citizens of Serbia in the Schengen area  the tangible result of our process of entry into the EU  which we hope to see implemented on 1 January 2010. This will bring us closer to Europe  for the right to travel without a visa is to the citizens of Serbia the expression of what the EU means on a daily basis.  But these are also values that have led us to modernize our administration  to adopt exemplary legislation in areas such as anti-discrimination and the protection of minorities  and to redouble our efforts towards regional reconciliation. That is an important reason why Serbia will shortly complete its full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia: it is a legal and moral obligation towards victims  towards ourselves and  above all  towards future generations.   As the twentieth anniversary of the fall of the Berlin wall approaches  we must not forget that the objective of uniting all the nations of Europe under the same roof has not yet been attained. Much remains to be done. Expansion fatigue must not emerge as a new reality in Europe. Solidarity must remain a high priority. It will never be time to consider an exit strategy with regard to the Western Balkans.  Permit me to stress that the facts are clear. All benefit from expansion: old and new members  as well    09-52470 4  as potential members of the EU. This goes beyond our wildest dreams  even at a time of economic challenges and political demoralization. That is because the values that unite us are strong and just. (spoke in English)  In that context  let me underline the necessity of strengthening regional cooperation. In June  Serbia hosted 15 heads of State during the Central European Summit  whose main topic was the interdependence of the economy  EU integration and energy. That demonstrated our commitment to acting constructively and working closely together with neighbouring countries to ensure that regional peace is consolidated.  With regard to Bosnia and Herzegovina  Serbia is a guarantor of the Dayton Agreement. Let there be no doubt that we will remain committed to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of that neighbouring country  as we will to those of all other United Nations Member States in the region and across the world.  In short  as the strategic anchor of stability in the Western Balkans  Serbia will invest even greater efforts in completing the democratic transformation of our part of Europe.  Serbia’s robust European vision is complemented by our strong determination to pursue a carefully balanced  artfully executed and active foreign policy aimed at engagement with nations throughout the world  near and far. That is in our long-term interest and will not change. Therefore  our engagement with Brussels  Moscow  Washington and Beijing — the four enduring pillars of Serbia’s foreign policy — will continue to be strengthened in the time ahead.  In conclusion  I want to emphasize another important dimension of our foreign policy. Serbia will continue to deepen ties with proud nations across the globe  many of which are members of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM). My country is the largest successor to a founding member of the Movement. Serbia’s capital  Belgrade  was the site of the first NAM summit  held in 1961. That is why I have proposed that the fiftieth anniversary of the Non-Aligned Movement be celebrated in Belgrade with an extraordinary summit under the auspices of the Egyptian chairmanship.  Let me emphasize that Serbia will continue to engage with NAM countries  not only to honour a legacy from the past and to renew traditional friendships  but also because we believe that international stability and prosperity cannot be consolidated without taking into account the views of the majority in the global family of nations.  I close by saying that the time for anyone to procrastinate  to try half-measures or to delay and discourage is coming to a close. In its place  we are entering a period in which only results matter — a period of consequence and momentous choice. Now comes our time of testing.  Our vision is simple: the universal application of the principles contained in the United Nations Charter  the strengthening of international law and human rights in an increasingly interdependent world  the equitable development of the global economy and the sustainable management of the environment throughout the world. Let us all have the courage to see that vision through to its rapid and noble completion."
"191",7591,"ZAF",64,2009,"This year marks the twentieth anniversary of the adoption  in 1989  of General Assembly resolution 44/27 A  on international solidarity with the liberation struggle in South Africa. That was one of numerous Assembly resolutions in which the nations of the world pledged their support for the eradication of apartheid.  Within months of the adoption of that important resolution  the ban on South African liberation movements was lifted. Nelson Mandela and other political prisoners were released. The stage was thus    09-52228 20  set for the negotiations that would eventually lead to the achievement of freedom and democracy in our country.  The role of the United Nations in the struggle to end apartheid is an exceptional example of the collective political will of the international community. It represented the victory of unity over division and of negotiation over confrontation. It represented a clear commitment to the promotion of basic human rights. As South Africans  we will always be grateful for that international solidarity.  Since the advent of democracy in 1994  we have built a solid  stable democracy  founded on the principles of unity  non-sexism  non-racialism and democracy. As we continue to build our young nation  we are cognizant of the need for a conducive international environment. For that reason  we are committed to playing our part  with the rest of the international community  in taking forward the fight against poverty and in responding to the crises that are confronting the world today. We must act now  together  to halt the degradation of the environment. We must act now  together  to prevent the global economic crisis from undoing the gains that we have achieved over decades.  The eradication of poverty must remain central to the work of the United Nations. The Organization must continue to work harder to unite the world to work to alleviate the suffering of the world’s poor and marginalized. The global economic meltdown has dealt a heavy blow to world efforts to eradicate poverty. But it should not diminish our resolve.  The United Nations must play a significant role in finding solutions to the global economic crisis. The crisis should not be an excuse to delay further action on the delivery of the Millennium Development Goals. Rather  it should urge us to double our efforts to achieve greater and faster progress. Developing countries did not cause the economic crisis  but they are severely affected by it. The crisis has further highlighted the urgent need for fundamental reform of the Bretton Woods institutions  including their mandate  scope  governance and responsiveness.  These institutions have been unrepresentative since their formation half a century ago. The current arrangements are inadequate and unfair. They do not reflect the changes that have taken place in the global economy. We should ensure that the election of the heads of all those institutions is more democratic  and opens opportunities to developing countries. The emerging and developing countries  including the poorest  must have a greater voice and greater participation in those institutions. Similarly  if we are to eradicate poverty there is an urgent need to conclude the Doha Round of trade negotiations in a manner that prioritizes development.  We continue to work for an African renewal  and welcome the ongoing support of the United Nations system in addressing the challenges facing the continent. Now more than ever  it is necessary for the United Nations to ensure that the international community collectively implements the commitments made to Africa. We have a viable socio-economic development blueprint  the New Partnership for Africa’s Development  which should be used in mobilizing resources for Africa. We appreciate that there can be no lasting peace without development  and no development without security.  Over the past 20 years  Africa has made much progress in working to end conflicts and to promote democratic practices and institutions. However  some pockets of conflict persist. For its part  South Africa has been engaged in mediation  conflict prevention and peacekeeping on the continent  in  among other places  Burundi  Zimbabwe and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  The African Union has the political will to resolve conflicts on the continent. However  it lacks resources to run effective peacekeeping interventions and conflict prevention mechanisms. We appeal for support for African peacemaking efforts  and for greater cooperation between the United Nations and the African Union. In this regard  we call on the General Assembly to align itself with resolutions of the African Union and the Southern African Development Community that do not recognize Governments that come into power by force or other unconstitutional means.  The search for global peace  stability and security cannot be separated from the pursuit of justice  self-determination  human rights and economic development. We need to constantly reaffirm the inalienable human rights of all people. We call for the full and effective implementation of the outcomes of the World Conference against Racism and the subsequent Durban Review Conference. It is of   21 09-52228  concern that at the close of the first decade of the twenty-first century there are still nations that find their lands occupied and their peoples oppressed.   We are convinced that urgent and concrete steps are needed to resolve the situation in Western Sahara.  We must work with similar urgency towards the achievement  through negotiations  of peaceful coexistence between Israelis and Palestinians. This must be based on the creation of a viable Palestinian State  existing side by side with Israel  within the 1967 borders  which must be secure and internationally recognized.  We also call for the lifting of the economic  commercial and financial embargo on Cuba.  We also appreciate the recent pronouncements by some nuclear-weapon States on their intention to reduce their nuclear arsenals.  Let us take up this new momentum and utilize the opportunity of the 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) to recommit ourselves to the full implementation of obligations under the NPT. We should ensure a balance among the objectives of disarmament  non-proliferation and the peaceful use of nuclear energy.  For Africa  the impact of climate change is devastating and will severely undermine development and poverty eradication efforts. We need to act now to ensure that there is an inclusive  fair and effective global agreement on this critical challenge. The agreement must recognize that solving the climate problem cannot be separated from the struggle to eradicate poverty. Developed countries bear the greatest responsibility for climate change and its impact. We must therefore strike a balance between adaptation and mitigation. Our goal should be to significantly reduce emissions across the globe without constraining development in the countries of the South.  Ms. McClean (Barbados)  Vice-President  took the Chair.  Developed countries must make ambitious  quantified and legally binding emission reduction commitments that are in line with science and that address their historical responsibilities. At Copenhagen  there needs to be agreement on new  additional  sustainable and predictable financing for adaptation. This should be for programmes that reduce the vulnerability of developing countries to the effects of climate change.  In a world that is increasingly interconnected and interdependent  international problems can be resolved effectively only through multilateral cooperation. The United Nations must continue to be at the centre of multilateralism  but it needs to be reformed if it is to carry out its mandate effectively  efficiently and transparently.  We remain committed to the view that no reform of the United Nations can be complete without the fundamental reform of the Security Council. It must be representative of the international community and reflect the geopolitical realities of today. If the Security Council is not reformed and does not have permanent representation for Africa  the legitimacy of the Council’s decisions will continue to be questioned. South Africa continues to advocate an expansion in both the permanent and non-permanent categories of membership.  Let me express our appreciation to the world for the celebration of the inaugural Nelson Mandela Day on 18 July this year. Scores of people engaged in a minimum of 67 minutes of voluntary action in the service of humanity  in honour of our icon  President Mandela. The Non-Aligned Movement has joined the call for this General Assembly to declare 18 July Nelson Mandela Day. This would be in recognition of President Mandela’s contribution to the struggle for democracy and the cause of humanity  and to promote community service across the globe. In this regard  we hope that the General Assembly will adopt a consensus resolution in support of Nelson Mandela Day.  South Africa is privileged to host the 2010 Fédération Internationale de Football Association World Cup in the middle of next year  which will be the first time that the tournament has been held on African soil. We look forward to hosting the peoples of the world  who will enjoy unique African hospitality and vibrancy.  I wish to take this opportunity to thank the outgoing President of the General Assembly for his leadership at the sixty-third session of the Assembly. I thank the General Assembly and representatives for the opportunity to address this esteemed gathering. Working together as a global family  we can do more to create a better and just world."
"192",7633,"ZMB",64,2009,"Let me join previous speakers in congratulating you  Sir  on your assumption of the presidency at the sixty-fourth session of the General Assembly. I should also like to extend Zambia’s sincere appreciation to His Excellency Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann for his able leadership during the sixty-third session.  The theme for this session provides us with an opportunity to evaluate existing multilateral approaches to address the challenges arising from globalization. Those include threats to socio-economic development and international peace and security. There is a need to develop innovative approaches and responses to those challenges  which include HIV/AIDS and influenza A(H1N1)  terrorism  climate change  nuclear weapons and  more recently  the global economic and financial crisis. In this globalized and interdependent world  no country  however wealthy or powerful it is  can resolve all those challenges single-handedly. Common solutions are therefore required through a strong United Nations.  This session is taking place against the backdrop of the adverse effects of the recent global economic and financial crisis  which has spared no one. In my own country of Zambia and in other African countries  the economic growth achieved from 2000 to 2007 is now declining as a result of the global economic and financial crisis. We are faced with serious financial constraints  lower commodity prices and weak external and domestic demand for our products  high inflation and rising unemployment. Manufacturing and construction activities have also slackened. As copper accounts for about 70 per cent of Zambia’s exports  the effect of the collapse of international copper prices — from $8 985 per metric tonne in August 2008 to $2 902 at the end of 2008 — has  among other things  resulted in greatly reduced revenue collections.  Zambia’s experience from the recent global financial and economic crisis is a timely reminder of the consequences of overdependence on a single economic sector. My Government has therefore developed a diversification plan to shift the economy from dependence on copper. That is being done through policy interventions in the agriculture  tourism and manufacturing sectors  coupled with programmes aimed at improving the business environment in Zambia.  For those efforts to succeed  however  there must be an expeditious conclusion to the World Trade Organization’s Doha Round of negotiations. Zambia considers the aid-for-trade component of the negotiations as critical  as it will develop our country’s capacity to overcome supply-side constraints and encourage value addition in its commodities.   47 09-52425   Zambia’s response to the global economic crisis needs the support of its international development partners. We appreciate that our cooperating partners have also been affected by the global economic crisis. Nonetheless  we urge them to fulfil their pledge to increase their contributions to official development assistance to 0.71 per cent of gross national income. That is necessary if the global development agenda is to help vulnerable economies  such as Zambia’s  meet the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015.  Zambia believes that there is a need to reform international financial governance systems in order to avoid future global financial crises. The changes  which must be inclusive  should respond to the needs and concerns of all nations  regardless of status. It is essential that there be an increase in the voice and power of developing countries at the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. The reform process should aim to improve the predictability of aid flows and emphasize reforms that promote faster aid delivery and fewer conditionalities.  Zambia roundly applauds the leadership that the United Nations provides in tackling climate change  as was illustrated only two days ago by the hosting of the high-level Summit on Climate Change. Our efforts to raise the standards of living for the world’s poor people in order to meet the Millennium Development Goals are being frustrated by the effects of climate change.   Scientists have spoken. We have seen with our own eyes  in just one generation  how great an effect climate change has had on our environment. On the eve of the Climate Change Summit  just a few days ago  unprecedented floods hit the state of Georgia in this country  as if to rebuke any of us who still doubt the evidence. Let us just look around us. We do not need science to tell us that deserts have expanded  that forests have drastically shrunk  that rivers have dried up and that it rains less and less in many places  and yet so much more in others. Nature has lost its balance and humankind has lost its footing.  In our own short lifespan  in my own country  I remember a time when forests were within a child’s walking distance  teeming with a profusion of animals  birds  plants  insects and fruits. Today my grandchildren would be lucky to name the indigenous fruits of our country on the fingers of one hand. So many species of our countries’ flora and fauna have become extinct — forever lost to the world — in such a short time.   Our children have spoken. Our citizens have spoken. If we go to Copenhagen to question the science yet again  or to make more speeches justifying inaction  if we still believe that we can only act after our competitors act  then we as leaders will have failed our peoples and consigned the world to utter destruction. Copenhagen is the precipice  either we step back and let live or tip over into the abyss. We must act  and act now.  With regard to mitigation  Zambia’s view is that the shared vision should be based on shared responsibilities for climate change; and that there must be an equitable burden-sharing mechanism that requires developed countries to commit to reducing emissions to legally binding levels  while developing countries take actions to ensure a substantial reduction from environment-degrading development programmes.  As the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference draws near  Zambia expects an agreement that will balance climate change concerns with development. The Copenhagen agreement must provide increased and predictable support for the implementation of the adaptation programme  which must be established within a binding legal instrument under the United Nations Framework Convention.  Speaking in my capacity as the Chairman of the International Conference on Great Lakes Region  I am happy to report to the Assembly that the Great Lakes region of Africa is now more stable and peaceful than it has ever been in the past 15 years  albeit with challenges. The improved relations between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda  and their joint efforts to tackle the problem of negative forces in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo  has opened up opportunities for achieving sustainable peace and stability in the region.  However  the region is still faced with the threat posed by the continued presence of illegal armed groups and negative forces  namely  the Forces démocratiques de libération du Rwanda (FDLR)/ ex-Forces armées rwandaises/Interahamwe  the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) and the Allied Democratic Forces. Although the recent joint military operations between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda succeeded in dislodging FDLR elements from most of their strongholds  the continued atrocities    09-52425 48  committed by the remnants of that group against civilians remains a great source of concern.  We applaud the role of the international community through the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in providing support for the Government of that country in its efforts to build military capacity to neutralize the negative forces in the eastern part of its territory. The international community needs to exert more sustained pressure on the leadership of those negative forces living within and outside the region  so that they are brought to justice.  The Lord’s Resistance Army  which fled to the north-eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Central African Republic after the Juba talks failed  continues to commit atrocities against the innocent civilian population. The Great Lakes mechanisms allowed for a joint military operation against the LRA  which  challenges notwithstanding  achieved some progress in dislodging rebel forces.  There is a need for sustained military and diplomatic pressure to bring Joseph Kony back to the negotiating table. There is also a need for more logistical support from the international community to protect the civilian population and  at the same time  put an end to the atrocities and brutality committed with impunity by the LRA.  The Great Lakes region is organizing a round table conference in Bujumbura  Burundi  to be held from 5 to 6 November 2009  at which we expect renewed support from the Group of Friends and other partners to finance the Pact on Security  Stability and Development in the Great Lakes Region.  Prior to the global economic downturn  Zambia’s economic growth was on course to meet all but one of the Millennium Development Goals  namely  ensuring environmental sustainability. However  the effect of the global financial and economic crisis  coupled with the effects of climate change  threaten the prospects of meeting the MDGs on poverty  agriculture and environmental sustainability.  The United Nations remains the central principal organ for coordinating international cooperation in socio-economic development  peace  security  human rights and the rule of law. There is a need to reform the United Nations in order to make it more effective and efficient. Zambia believes that the reform of the United Nations will not be complete without meaningful reform of the Security Council. Making the Council more representative  democratic and accountable to all Member States  irrespective of status  is essential if its decisions are to be acceptable to the entire international community. The Security Council must adapt to the realities of the new geopolitical situation that characterize the world.  Given that Africa constitutes the second largest bloc of United Nations membership  proposals to reform the Security Council should heed Africa’s call for two permanent seats with veto power and two additional non-permanent seats. That would address the historical injustice against Africa while responding to the need to democratize the Security Council. Equally important in that regard is the need to reform the working methods of that important United Nations body.  Human rights issues are an important component in the maintenance of peace and stability in any country. I wish to inform the Assembly that  since Zambia was elected a member of the Human Rights Council  in 2006  it has continued to advocate for the promotion and protection of human rights. In May 2008  Zambia extended an open invitation to all mandate holders on special areas of focus relating to issues of human rights to visit and evaluate the extent to which Zambia observes its obligations under the various United Nations conventions. We urge other countries to follow suit.  Even in the post-cold-war era  nuclear arms pose a threat to international peace and security and the very existence of humankind. It is for that reason that Zambia stands for general and complete disarmament in a time-bound manner  to include biological  chemical  nuclear and radiological weapons. The demand of the time is that we compete for peace  not war  for development and not armaments.   There is no doubt that the United Nations continues to be the only multilateral institution capable of addressing the challenges of our one world. This session’s theme attests to that fact. The world looks up to this body to encourage dialogue among civilizations on all global challenges in an inclusive manner as the only practical way to ensure meaningful and effective international cooperation.  Allow me to conclude by quoting Jonathan Rauch in the January 2001 issue of The Atlantic magazine  in   49 09-52425  his article entitled “The New Old Economy: Oil  Computers and the Reinvention of the Earth”  as quoted by R. A. Bisson and Jay Lehr in the preface to their book entitled Modern Groundwater Exploration. In the article  which looked at future oil supply  Mr. Rauch predicted that demand for oil will peter out well before supply runs out because  he argued  something cheaper and cleaner would come along. He concluded by stating that “knowledge  not petroleum  is becoming the critical resource in the oil business” and that  although the supply of oil is fixed  the supply of knowledge is boundless.  Thus human ingenuity holds the secret to resolving problems confronting humankind. So it is with all the issues facing us and this United Nations of ours today. The resolution of our problems of climate change  the economic and financial crisis  peace and security and human rights and democracy depends upon human ingenuity. The United Nations must therefore first — and most important — work to create an environment where ingenuity can indeed flourish  that is  a peaceful world where all feel they belong and are treated with dignity.  Before I conclude my remarks  let me just say a word or two about the embargo that has been imposed on the people and Government of Cuba since 1959 by the United States of America. Those unfair and unjustified sanctions have greatly hurt the people of Cuba. The time has come for those sanctions to be lifted. I join those who are calling for the lifting of sanctions. "
"193",7669,"ZWE",64,2009,"Let me begin by extending our warmest congratulations to you  Sir  on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. Your election to this high office is a fitting and eloquent tribute to the personal and diplomatic qualities that we have witnessed in you over the years. We are indeed proud of the honour that has been bestowed upon the African continent by your election. We are confident that under your wise stewardship we will make pleasing progress on the important agenda before us.  In the same vein  Mr. President  I wish to commend your predecessor  the President at the sixty-third session  Father Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann  for having brought his experience and wisdom to bear upon the various meetings and conferences that he presided over during the last year. He brought integrity  transparency and credibility to the deliberations of the General Assembly. Indeed  we share his assertion that the “G-192” — that is  the General Assembly — being the most representative body of the United Nations  is the best forum in which to tackle global issues  which include the current financial and economic crises. We commend him for standing up for what is right and for upholding the right of each Member State  no matter how small  to be heard.  Over the years  my delegation has underlined the need for the United Nations and other international bodies to truly serve the collective interest of all Member States. Our unchanging conviction is that all international institutions should abide by the universal principles that underlie the multilateral processes of decision-making  particularly  the principle of equality among States and the right to development. It is in this context that we welcome the appropriate  indeed  timely  theme of this session  namely  effective global responses to global crises  and strengthening multilateralism and dialogue among civilizations. It is our hope that we will have a candid and holistic debate on the global responses to the crises that currently affect our world.  Zimbabwe supports the revitalization of the General Assembly in order to make it more effective and thus enable it to fulfil its mandate. As the pre-eminent deliberative and policymaking body of the United Nations  the Assembly should play a more active role in mobilizing action against such challenges    09-52463 2  today as the maintenance of peace and security  the financial and economic crises  economic and social development and climate change.   Accordingly  the encroachment of other United Nations organs on the work of the General Assembly is of great concern to us. We therefore reiterate that any process of revitalization should strengthen the principle of the accountability of all principal and subsidiary organs of the United Nations to the Assembly.  It is our hope that the current negotiations on the reform of the Security Council will break the deadlock that for some time now has prevented us from making progress in an area of strategic interest to Africa. The reform of the Council is not only desirable but imperative if it is to ensure the successful implementation of its global mandate to maintain international peace and security on behalf of all Member States.   The fact that Africa  a major geographical region  remains underrepresented and without a permanent seat on the Security Council is not only a serious and antiquated anomaly whose time for address is overdue. It is also clearly an untenable violation of the principle and practice of democracy in international relations. The reform of the Security Council should urgently take full notice of the African position  which demands two permanent seats  with complete veto power — as long as the veto lasts — plus two additional non-permanent seats.  The United Nations Conference on the World Financial and Economic Crisis and Its Impact on Development  held in June 2009  rightfully positioned the Organization at the centre of efforts to deal with the global financial and economic crisis. The devastating effect of the current global crisis has clearly exposed the folly of leaving the management of the global economy in the hands of a few self-appointed countries and groupings.   My delegation  therefore  fully supports the setting up of a follow-up working group under the aegis of the General Assembly. It is urgent and critical that the working group reach an early agreement on immediate policy actions to be taken by the international community in support of developing countries  which have suffered the most as a result of this global financial meltdown. Such actions should include the development of a global stimulus plan to respond to the crisis and issues related to it.  Those measures will not achieve the desired objectives unless accompanied by a comprehensive reform of the Bretton Woods institutions. Such reforms would  inter alia  include representation of sub-Saharan Africa on the Executive Boards of these institutions. We are glad that our unequivocal call for their reform is beginning to bear fruit. We welcome the recent decision by the World Bank to establish three seats for Africa on its Executive Board. We are similarly pleased that  earlier this month  the International Monetary Fund finalized the re-allocation of special drawing rights on the basis of the $250 billion pledged by the Group of 20 at its meeting in April 2009. Regrettably  only a mere $18 billion of this money was allocated to low-income countries  while the developed countries — which caused the crisis  after all — got the lion’s share.  The need to ensure global food security has been raised and restated at many international forums. We reiterate our call for an urgent and substantial increase in investment in agriculture in developing countries. It is critical that provisions of agricultural inputs — seeds  fertilizers and chemicals — be put in place for small-scale farmers  particularly women.   To achieve this  we need to channel more support towards agriculture  which has dwindled over the last few decades. In addition  we call upon developed countries to remove or reduce their agricultural subsidies and to open up their markets to agricultural products from developing countries.  In the area of health  efforts to reduce maternal and child mortality and to combat HIV and AIDS  malaria and tuberculosis still fall short of targets despite the commitments made at national and international levels. Over the last few years  Zimbabwe has made great strides in the fight against the HIV and AIDS pandemic  our limited resources notwithstanding. The country has witnessed a drop in the adult prevalence rate from 20 per cent in 2000 to 11 per cent this year.   However  we still face a major challenge in increasing the availability of affordable antiretroviral drugs. We therefore continue to urge the international community  in cooperation with pharmaceutical companies  to assist in increasing access to affordable essential drugs  particularly for people in Africa. People living with HIV and AIDS expect delivery on the commitments we have made.    3 09-52463   For sub-Saharan Africa  malaria presents yet another still-formidable challenge. The commitment of the international community and national Governments therefore needs to be strengthened to eradicate the scourge of malaria in our part of the world.  We warmly welcome the renewed enthusiasm on the part of Russia and the United States to pursue actions to achieve a world free of nuclear weapons  and we urge other nuclear-armed States to do the same. In this regard  Zimbabwe is honoured to have chaired  in May of this year  the third session of the Preparatory Committee for the 2010 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference and takes this opportunity to thank all members for their support. We are hopeful that  having secured agreement on the Conference agenda  members will produce a renewed commitment to the three pillars of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty: nuclear disarmament  non-proliferation and peaceful use of nuclear energy.  I would now like to turn to developments in my country. Since its formation in February this year  the Inclusive Government in Zimbabwe has demonstrated a conviction and unity of purpose and an unwavering commitment to chart a new vision for the country and to improve the lives of the people in peace and harmony. In the Global Political Agreement  we have defined our priorities as the maintenance of conditions of peace and stability  economic recovery  development  promotion of human rights and improvement of the condition of women and children.  Regrettably  while countries in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) region have made huge sacrifices and given Zimbabwe financial and other support at a time when they too are reeling from the effects of the global economic crisis  the Western countries — in particular the United States and the European Union  who imposed illegal sanctions on Zimbabwe — have  to our surprise  and that of SADC and the rest of Africa  refused to remove the sanctions. We wonder what their motives are  and we ask what they would want to see us do. Indeed  some Western countries are working strenuously to divide the parties in the Inclusive Government. If they will not assist the Inclusive Government in rehabilitating our economy  could they please  please stop their filthy clandestine  divisive antics. Where stand their humanitarian principles  we ask  when their illegal sanctions are ruining the lives of our children?  We simply call for an immediate end to the coercive  illegal and unjustified 50-year economic  commercial and financial embargo against Cuba  which is estimated to have cost Cuba a total of some $96 billion so far. My delegation joins other countries of the Non-Aligned Movement that have repeatedly condemned the use of unilateral coercive measures as a flagrant violation of the norms of international law and international relations  especially as they govern relations between States under the United Nations Charter.  Let me conclude by reiterating the need for effective and comprehensive multilateralism to promote a global partnership for peace and development. The United Nations and other international organizations that carry the legitimacy of multilateralism should play a leading role in directing the course of events and developments  taking into account the interests of the majority of the Organization’s members in an inclusive  peaceful  just  universal and democratic manner.   It is our hope that through our unity  solidarity  cooperation and commitment  the challenges facing the international community can be addressed. Let us rise to the occasion and demonstrate our political will and ability to work together for the good of humanity. Zimbabwe is willing and ready to play its part."
