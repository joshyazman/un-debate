"1",38,"AFG",63,2008,"Since the last time we gathered here in this great Hall  we have passed a year of great hopes and grave fears. We have witnessed the hope-inspiring glory of human accomplishment at the Olympic Games in Beijing but shuddered at crumbling stock and housing markets around the world. We have a growing global understanding on climate change and the issues relevant to it  but seen millions of lives threatened by the shortage of food in many countries and witnessed with disbelief the brutal slaughter of innocent people at the hands of terrorists in Afghanistan  Pakistan  India  Algeria and several other parts of the world.  Since I spoke at this rostrum in the last session of the General Assembly  my country  Afghanistan  has grappled with a number of important challenges  none more troubling than the problem of international terrorism. Terrorist forces have significantly increased their attacks and brutality  and enjoyed freedom in their sanctuaries.  While Afghanistan has borne the brunt of terrorist violence  the scourge has now spread like a wildfire across the wider region. In Pakistan  where  until recently  extremist circles remained mainly focused on destabilizing Afghanistan  today terrorist violence is unfortunately also directed within Pakistani territory and against the Pakistani people.   Daily acts of intimidation and violence against communities in Afghanistan and Pakistan  in particular on both sides of the Durand Line  the killing of political and tribal leaders and the burning of schools are the upshots of the continued spawning and spread of terrorism and extremism in the region.    29 08-51749   The callous attack on the Marriot hotel in Islamabad over the weekend  the bombing of the Indian Embassy in Kabul and the terrorist attacks in the Indian cities of Bangalore and Ahmedabad were the most disturbing demonstration of terrorists’ growing reach.  Undoubtedly  terrorism will not go away until we dismantle the elaborate institutional support terrorists enjoy in the region and eliminate their secure sanctuaries. That will be possible only if we engage in sincere regional and international cooperation.  The democratic transition in Pakistan  heralded by the historic elections of last February  has been a most promising development in our region.  We in Afghanistan have warmly welcomed the inauguration of the civilian democratic Government. In particular  I take the opportunity to once again congratulate my brother  President Asif Ali Zardari  on his election as the President of Pakistan. I assure my brothers  President Zardari and Prime Minister Gillani  that Afghanistan stands ready to take several steps for each single step that Pakistan will take to address the challenge of radicalism and terrorism.  To the extent that terrorism in our region continues to be a global threat  evolving in nature and tactics  the struggle against it must continue unabated. In this context  I recall with appreciation this year’s North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Summit in Bucharest  where around 40 countries with existing military commitments in Afghanistan once again reiterated their strong resolve to stay the course.  Among the most significant outcomes of the summit was the emphasis on the Afghanization of the security sector as a measure to ensure sustainability and enhanced effectiveness. To that end  I call for a redoubling of efforts by the international community aimed at enabling the Afghan national security institutions  both the army and the police  to take on a greater share of the war against terrorism and for the protection of our people.  Above all  Afghanization of military operations is vital if the problem of civilian casualties is to be addressed effectively. The continuation of civilian casualties could seriously undermine the legitimacy of the fight against terrorism and the credibility of the Afghan people’s partnership with the international community.  Whereas the military endeavour at the regional and international levels remains the primary response to the threat of terrorism  success will only be possible if the local population is empowered to confront it. Therefore  while terrorism and a persistent environment of insecurity are at work to subvert Afghanistan’s growth  we must do what it takes to win the battle of Afghanistan’s economic development.   Last June  my Government launched the Afghanistan National Development Strategy at the Afghanistan donors conference in Paris. If the pledges made at the conference are translated into timely commitments  I am confident that we will attain the development goals set out in our Strategy.  On behalf of the people of Afghanistan  I thank President Nicholas Sarkozy of France for his leadership in excellently organizing the Paris conference. I also thank the United States and all the other countries around the world that pledged generously towards the implementation of the Afghanistan National Development Strategy.  As in the security sector  Afghanization of the development process is the key not just to the goal of ensuring ownership but also to the effective implementation of our Development Strategy. Afghanization of the development process can be achieved through a meaningful commitment by our friends and donors to aid effectiveness. In that context  while urging a shift away from the use of parallel structures and wasteful mechanisms  I strongly endorse the role of the United Nations and the special representative of the Secretary-General  Mr. Kai Eide  in coordinating the international community’s participation in Afghanistan’s development and State-building processes.  Thanks to the selfless sacrifices of men and women of Member States and the determination and sacrifices of our own people  the journey of Afghanistan’s reconstruction is resolutely under way. Today our people are more educated  healthier  better off and more optimistic about their future. We have built thousands of new schools and reconstructed many more  where millions of our youngsters go to school and prepare for the responsibilities of tomorrow. Our rapid economic growth  with double-digit growth rates almost every year  has resulted in higher income and better living conditions for our people. Our rural development programmes have improved lives in    08-51749 30  thousands of our villages that had never before seen an agent of the State among them.  We have also taken a number of legal and institutional measures to intensify our anti-corruption efforts  such as establishing the High Office of Oversight and Anti-Corruption  including special units in the Office of the Attorney-General and in the judiciary to oversee efforts aimed at eliminating corruption through preventive  educational and enforcement measures. We are committed to ensuring more concrete results in the coming years.  Also very important  on counter-narcotics  this year we have registered a 20 per cent decline in total opium production  while the number of poppy-free provinces has reached 18  making 50 per cent of the country virtually poppy-free. The key to sustaining our success will be ensuring alternative livelihoods for our farmers  investing to a greater extent in law enforcement and interdiction and  above all  addressing the far greater dimensions of the world’s drug trade that lie outside Afghanistan  such as reduction of demand in foreign markets and stricter border controls.  Our efforts in counter-narcotics and in other areas have been complicated by the acute shortage of food within the country. In collaboration with the United Nations  we have launched a humanitarian appeal that we hope will receive a timely response from our partners in the international community.  The United Nations Charter promises freedom  justice  a dignified life  security and peace  and it is incumbent on all of us to work together to ensure that those promises are kept. Today  there are still too many corners of the world where conflict and tension are putting the lives and livelihoods of millions of people in jeopardy.   We deeply sympathize with our Palestinian brothers and sisters and their struggle and suffering. We urge a just and comprehensive settlement that fully realizes the rights of the Palestinian people  including their right to an independent State  living in peace  side by side with the State of Israel.  Today  once again  this Assembly session has brought us together at a time when our world is poised between great opportunities and menacing challenges. I am confident that we will make use of our growing collective ability as a community of nations to do what is right for the betterment of our world."
"2",77,"AGO",63,2008,"I am particularly honoured to address the General Assembly on behalf of His Excellency Mr. José Eduardo dos Santos  President of the Republic of Angola.  First  I should like  on behalf of my Government  to warmly congratulate Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann on his election to preside over this organ. We wish him all success during his mandate and assure him of the support of my country.  The present session of the General Assembly is taking place at a time of serious challenges for the international community. They include the food crisis  the rise in fuel prices  unexpected climate change  the financial crisis  the escalation of cold-war rhetoric and terrorism. The global scale of those challenges and their negative effects on the lives of millions of human beings on all continents indicate that we are at a critical moment. We must overcome those challenges through a collective response  with the central role played by the United Nations. Above all  however  each State must also act individually.  With regard to the financial crisis  we must take measures that help to prevent serious effects on the global economy  especially the economies of the more vulnerable countries. Such measures must be effective and must help to reduce the negative impact on the progress that African countries have already made by implementing reforms that have enabled them to have an annual growth rate of 5 per cent.   We are also concerned at the rise in food prices. That has dealt a hard blow to the efforts to fight poverty  which affects more than 1 billion people. The rise in food prices is closely linked to climate change  which is not only causing the destruction of infrastructure and basic means of subsistence in many countries  but is also forcing millions of people into poverty.  The elimination of distorting elements in international trade is also fundamental if we are to resolve the world food crisis. The agricultural subsidies provided by the wealthiest countries to their farmers are ruining the farming production in poor countries  rendering difficult their farmers’ access to international markets. The failure of the World Trade Organization negotiations during the Doha Round last July further aggravated that scenario. The collapse of those talks eliminated the chances of concluding  in the short term  a general trade agreement that would remove such subsidies and other obstacles to international trade exchanges. The Republic of Angola hopes that negotiations will resume as soon as possible and that the main actors will show the necessary flexibility to allow countries that are underprivileged as a result of the lack of a global trade agreement to avoid remaining eternally marginalized from the global economy.  Turning this extremely dangerous situation around  particularly for the countries of the South  requires that the General Assembly intensify its efforts. Our hope is that the President will steer the debate towards addressing these concerns. The Republic of Angola commits itself to contributing  within the limits of its capacity  to finding solutions to these problems that affect all States.  South-South cooperation  including triangular cooperation  has the potential to contribute to the eradication of poverty through the establishment of partnerships for sustainable development  trade    55 08-52265  investment  tourism  prevention and combating of drug trafficking  illicit trade in small arms and light weapons  and transnational organized crime. In that connection  Angola is honoured to chair the Zone of Peace and Cooperation of the South Atlantic  an effective interregional mechanism for cooperation in the areas of development  peace and security among its 24 member States in Africa and South America.   I would like to avail myself of the opportunity to assure our international partners that the Republic of Angola is motivated more than ever to assume the responsibilities that arise from membership in the institutions of the international community  those of the African continent and those of the United Nations. Our engagement and commitment will  in the meantime  continue to lie primarily in the maintenance of peace and security  the consolidation of democracy  respect for human rights and sustainable economic development  on the basis of the social laws of a market economy that will safeguard the interests and the satisfaction of the majority of the population.  Those are the principles that have guided our trajectory as a country  in particular since the end of the cold war. A coherent application of those principles is the basis for the progress that Angola is building in the political  social and economic domains. As a result  since 2002  a climate of peace prevails in the entire country  with the eradication of conflict factors and important advances in national reconciliation  emergence of a highly entrepreneurial private sector  a dynamic civil society and a free  vibrant and active press.  In the last five years  Angola has been registering high economic growth rates. During this period  the gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an estimated rate of 14.7 per cent in real terms. The non-oil sector grew at a rate of 17.4 per cent  faster than the oil sector  which reached an annual growth rate of 12.7 per cent. This growth allowed the unemployment rate  which in the mid-1990s was estimated to be at 45 per cent  to decrease to an estimated level of 22.5 per cent in 2007.   The relative weight of the extractive industry  dominated by the oil and diamond subsectors  grew at a significant rate of 61.6 per cent. Moreover  Angola saw a reduction in inflation levels from 105.6 per cent in December 2003 to 11.78 per cent in December 2007  as well as a transformation in public accounts from a deficit of 7 per cent of the GDP in 2003 to a surplus of 11.4 per cent of the GDP in 2007. These figures encourage us to be optimistic in relation to the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals.  On 5 September of this year  Angola added one more pillar to its democratic structure by holding legislative elections in a transparent and totally free environment. Despite the criticism and the pressure on the Angolan Government to hold the elections earlier  independently of the objective and subjective conditions prevailing at the time  the discernment of its leader  His Excellency Mr. José Eduardo dos Santos  demonstrated that the elections were held at the most appropriate moment.  With the gradual yet significant improvement in the quality of life of the people  and with fully reconciled and peaceful spirits  a climate of tolerance and political coexistence emerged into its optimal space. The elections were indeed an expression of the reaffirmation of our dignity.  All the efforts involved in the complex electoral process that led to the success of this historic feat were made with the human and material resources of the Angolan Government. We are proud to once more have given a good example of political maturity  civic discipline and full popular participation. It gives us joy to state before this Assembly that  like other peoples of the world  Africans have the capability and the ability to build their own destiny and develop participatory democracy.  Armed conflicts continue to absorb resources from both the international community and the parties involved  resources that could be better utilized for the well-being of the population in affected territories. However  for the first time in many years  Africa is experiencing a significant reduction in conflict  allowing for improved economic indicators. The progress in the peace process in Côte d’Ivoire and the consolidation of peace under way in Sierra Leone and in Liberia have brought about a new aura of hope. Furthermore  the progress made in the Democratic Republic of Congo  despite some tension in the eastern areas  is manifestly encouraging.  We hope that the efforts currently being made by the United Nations and the African Union  as well as by regional organizations  will help resolve the conflicts in Somalia and Darfur in a peaceful manner.    08-52265 56   As Chair of the Organ on Politics  Defence and Security Co-operation of the Southern African Development Community (SADC)  the Republic of Angola has given its all  together with the other countries of that region and the facilitator  to support the negotiation process with a view ending the political crisis in Zimbabwe. Angola welcomes the inter-party agreement reached in Zimbabwe and will continue to make efforts to help the parties put national interests before all personal quarrels so as to ease the return to political stability and to reverse the grim economic situation that prevails in the country. We appeal to the international community  particularly to the European Union  to support the programme aimed at overcoming the crisis  which will be drawn up by the inclusive Government resulting from the inter-party agreement. We also call for the subsequent lifting of the sanctions imposed on that country.  However  we must remain vigilant to the possibility of the eruption of new conflicts due to the political instability that exists in other countries of the continent. We must invest in preventive diplomacy and in the strengthening of rapid alert mechanisms.   In the Middle East  the latest developments seem to introduce a light at the end of the tunnel  with regard  to a definitive resolution of the Palestinian and the Israeli-Arab issues. Angola encourages the parties involved to engage in a dialogue that will lead to the de facto and de jure establishment of a Palestinian State  with recognized borders  coexisting side by side with Israel.  My Government maintains its solidarity with the Common African Position and with all those who advocate the need to democratize the United Nations and to reform its system  including the expansion of the Security Council so that it reflects a fair and equitable regional representation  with all the rights inherent in membership.  I would not like to end my statement without once again conveying my regret to the General Assembly over the continuation of the embargo that the Republic of Cuba is subjected to by the United States of America. It constitutes a situation that does not comply with the rules that govern relations between States. We are in an age of peaceful coexistence among peoples and nations  and that embargo wounds the universal collective conscience of our time. "
"3",124,"ALB",63,2008,"It is a special pleasure for me to address the General Assembly at its sixty-third session. Allow me to congratulate the Assembly President on his election to his high position. Albania welcomes cooperation with him. I would like to take this opportunity to assure the President of the full support of my country. I would also like to express my highest praise to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his vision and continuous efforts to revitalize and to reform our Organization  the United Nations.   Allow me also to confirm Albania’s commitment to a strong and coherent United Nations  capable of successfully tackling the challenges we currently face. We fully support the joint initiatives and actions aimed at strengthening collective peace and security in order to achieve sustainable and long-term development to promote human rights and international cooperation. We consider that reform of the Organization in all its aspects is possible only through cooperation  dialogue and consensus.   The global fight against terrorism  especially through guaranteeing an effective response to this collective threat  demands that the United Nations continue to play a very important role. My country  Albania  has very actively met its responsibilities in the global fight against terrorism. In compliance with the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy  which the General Assembly unanimously passed on  8 September 2006  Albania continues to be a stability factor in the region and beyond through its moderating and constructive policy. It contributes with peacekeeping troops in the framework of the United Nations and other security organizations in Afghanistan  Iraq  Georgia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. It recently deployed 68 troops to Chad as part of the European Union-led peacekeeping force. Albania is also working to enhance its domestic capacities to enable a greater presence in aiding global    08-51839 38  peace and security by deepening its cooperation with the United Nations in the field of peacekeeping operations.   Albania has already become part of the United Nations system-wide coherence effort for reform of the Organization by willingly joining the One United Nations initiative. It fully supports this project and is actively working with United Nations agencies to secure new ways of partnership in the fields of development  humanitarian assistance and the environment. One United Nations is being carried out in full respect for national sovereignty and national ownership of development and in compliance with the needs and priorities of our country  especially of the integration to the European Union (EU) and meeting the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).   As a pilot country  we are aware of this responsibility  and we will do everything possible to turn this initiative into a tangible success. In my country the MDGs are not viewed simply as development objectives  but also as a means for growth. Albania has nationalized the MDGs by drafting and following step-by-step implementation instructions for the zonal strategies of development. It has also added one more objective: that of good governance. Keeping in mind experiences to date  meeting the MDGs in countries with small and medium incomes demands continuous support from the national leadership  a more efficient use of resources and a closer partnership among all the players — in Governments  the international community and civil society.   We are very active in the framework of the Alliance of Civilizations  and we are convinced that this initiative already presents a political instrument of the United Nations to build peace in the broader meaning of the term. Following up that commitment  Albania has compiled a national strategy of intercultural dialogue  which reflects the centuries-old tradition of full religious harmony and understanding.   Climate change presents a global concern and threat  and as such it affects my country as well. Albania considers it a priority issue and assesses it in the framework of the implementation of the One United Nations initiative. It joins the international community with determination in the challenge of global climate change and modestly contributes to reducing emissions quotas to secure a better and a more developed future.   The world food crisis continues to be one of the most complex challenges faced by humanity. It not only affects the health and survival of millions of people all over the world  but directly threatens political and economic stability by seriously putting into question the achievement of the MDGs. The causes of this crisis are numerous and complex. As such  they demand a multilevel  coherent and well-coordinated response. My country hails the Secretary-General’s establishment of the High-Level Task Force on the Global Food Security Crisis.   Albania is undertaking a full programme of institutional  economic and legal reforms through which we aim to transform Albania into a country attractive to foreign investments  with a market open to free enterprise. I have the pleasure to point out that the latest World Bank report listed Albania as second among countries that have implemented successful reforms to facilitate business practices during 2007 and 2008.   Albania has gained the status of a medium-income country  and I believe that this progress must be consolidated in compliance with the new challenges of development. The national strategy for development and integration has determined our vision for the next seven years of Albania as a country of high democratic standards  fully guaranteeing the fundamental human rights  with its sustainable economic and social development aimed at integrating into NATO and the European Union  as well as harmonizing with the MDGs — a country providing a better and safer life to future generations.   Albania enjoys a solid and irreversible relationship with the EU. The Stabilization and Association Agreement serves as our guide  and the primary objective is the conclusion of the ratification agreement by the end of this year. The European countries and the European Commission have invested considerably in Albania. We have responded to this contribution not only with natural gratitude  but also with concrete commitments and with joint and coordinated work programmes in the fields of good governance  institutional functioning and economic growth and in the fight against organized crime and corruption.    39 08-51839   Albania’s path towards full Euro-Atlantic integration is widely supported by the Albanian public and its political spectrum. In particular  the invitation to join NATO at the Bucharest Summit  the signing of the alliance and the protocols on 8 July 2008 and the ongoing ratification process all mark historic achievements for Albania and are a positive assessment of the new and tangible Albanian reality. Albania will respond to this assessment with greater responsibility and determination in the face of the obligation that stems from full-fledged membership in the alliance  which will serve peace and security not only in the Balkans  but in the Mediterranean region and beyond.   Albania pays particular attention to the strengthening of multilateral regional relations. It seriously encourages the process of regional cooperation by being an active partner in all of the initiatives undertaken in South-East Europe. That engagement serves to promote good neighbourliness  strengthening security  building trust among the regional countries  stability and full integration of all the countries in the region in the Euro-Atlantic structures.   Challenges such as the fight against terrorism  organized crime  arms proliferation and border management have an interlinked character that can be overcome only through joint actions  initiatives and commitment. We will continue to play the same constructive role for our benefit and for that of the whole region.   Albania considers the foundation of the independent and sovereign State of Kosovo as the most important historical event and development of our region at the beginning of this century. An independent and democratic Kosovo  oriented towards Euro-Atlantic integration  is the just and most sustainable solution. It is an example of the most successful investment made by the international community towards the implementation of the rule of law  to long-term stability and peace and development in the Balkans and beyond.   The independence of Kosovo finally frees that part of Europe from the nightmare of war  of  inter-ethnic conflicts and of ethnic cleansing and genocide. It fulfils and respects the free will of the people to break free from political oppression  historical injustices and the inability to develop. Kosovo is no longer being led by the failed Yugoslavia  nor by the new moderate Yugoslavs. It is being led by the principles of a civilized Europe and those of the universalized United Nations.   Albania encourages the people and the Government of Kosovo in their commitment to build a democratic and multi-ethnic society in which  regardless of ethnic considerations  its every citizen will feel like a free man in his home and on his property. The new constitution of Kosovo and the Ahtisaari package meet the highest standards of human rights and offer widespread protection to all the communities living in Kosovo  especially to the Serbs of Kosovo.   We are convinced that  following the guidelines of the Secretary-General of the United Nations  all necessary actions will be taken as soon as possible: the United Nations presence will be reconfigured and the European Union Rule of Law Mission Kosovo — EULEX — will be spread over the entire territory of Kosovo  thus avoiding any vacuum of power and imposition of competences on top of each other and preventing any possible regressive attempt  regardless of where it may have originated  against this Euro-Atlantic process.   Albania deems as unfounded the efforts to draw parallels between Kosovo and the regions of Georgia — Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Numerous historical  judicial  constitutional  political and demographic arguments demonstrate that Kosovo is a unique case — a sui generis case — and the solution implemented is unique as well. As such  it does not and cannot serve as a model to solve other conflicts either in the region or beyond it. Any political  economic  military or diplomatic endeavour against the consolidation or soundness of the State of Kosovo would be a hopeless attempt against its process of integration to NATO and the EU  a regressive move against the investments and progress that we so direly need  and it could not be sold as valuable to the European Union. Historical dreams must not darken the vision of the future.   Albania is convinced that the recognition of the new State of Kosovo is in the interests of Kosovo  Albania  Serbia and of all its close and distant neighbours. It is in the interest of the European and Mediterranean region. That is why Kosovo — this new political  economical and social reality — fully deserves to be a Member of our United Nations as soon as possible. I call upon the Assembly to admit with    08-51839 40  realism this irreversible development by recognizing and supporting  without any reserve  the Republic of Kosovo.   Albania continues to remain committed to cooperating with and enriching and fulfilling the United Nations ideals by fully believing in the active role of the international community as it faces the present global challenges. In order to fulfil this mission  we must all together give our support and readiness to this Organization  which embodies not only universal values  but also the aspirations of humanity.  "
"4",147,"AND",63,2008,"“I am committed to truth  not to what is established ” said Gandhi. The Millennium Development Goals  which seek between now and 2015 to eradicate extreme poverty  achieve universal primary education  promote gender equality  reduce infant mortality  fight the spread of such diseases as HIV/AIDS and malaria  and guarantee environmental sustainability  are a challenge to us all  individually and collectively. Each human being is unique and respect for others must be both universal and imperative.  The world is paradoxical. We meet here during these weeks to speak of the food crisis and famine in the world  and we do so 63 years after having set in motion actions and structures within the framework of the United Nations to eradicate such phenomena.  In 2008  well into the twenty-first century  of the 2.5 billion poor people living in the countries of the South  950 million live in conditions of extreme poverty. The forecasts of the International Fund for Agricultural Development indicate that  by 2025  the world will have 2 billion more people living in conditions of extreme poverty.  In one year  the world has been confronted  as it was in the last century  by mass movements of populations driven by hunger. The Governments of the wealthiest countries  international agencies and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) stand helpless before the worsening malnutrition and social tensions that have resulted.  The Secretary-General declared in his 2007 report on the Millennium Development Goals that the world does not want more promises. However  reality in its crudest aspect has put us through disturbances in recent months caused by people who are suffering famine in various countries. On Tuesday  the President reminded us in his opening speech of the perils of our current situation. We face a global financial crisis  a global energy crisis  a global food crisis and climate change. Faced with this situation  it is inevitable that we ask ourselves the questions: What did we do wrong? What is it that does not work?  The prices of basic food products have risen by 50 per cent in one year  and a group of United Nations experts has determined that the price of goods around the world has risen by 30 per cent since January 2008. If we take into account that there are 1.4 billion people living on less than $1.25 a day  there are far too many people living in the world today in extremely precarious conditions  with no access to schools  potable water or basic health care and hygiene.  Some experts say that the food crisis is the result of the failure of development policies that were adopted to encourage economic and social progress in countries classified as poor. Those countries often have substantial natural resources and could produce basic products  such as cereals  but reality is obstinate and the fact is that two thirds of developing countries are net importers of food products.  Alfred Sauvy  the economist and sociologist  said that the milestone of the economy is not labour but consumption. That is the source of one of the principal current problems. Consumer goods are scarce and demand exceeds supply. The Director-General of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)  Jacques Diouf  forecasts an increase of 56 per cent in the cost of imports of cereals for the more disadvantaged countries  but he also forecasts an increase of 53 per cent for the European countries.  The current crisis is closely related to the geographical distribution of productivity. Perhaps production should be increased in the places where people are suffering famine and less surplus sent from countries with more resources  since it contributes to increasing the dependency of the poor countries. In that respect  we agree with the decision of the World Bank to double its loans for agriculture to Africa  with a provision of $800 million for 2009.  At the same time and in order to correct the distortions that have been created in the markets  the liberalization of agricultural markets must be accompanied by measures of support for small local farmers so as to avoid the temptation of giving up production in favour of importing foreign food products. In fact  liberalization would have to be reinvented. Rather than serving as a common pattern for all countries  it would have to be applied according to the specific circumstances of each country  while the pros and cons are analysed with caution.  On the other hand  the subject of agricultural subsidies has not been resolved definitively  nor has true freedom of trade  which would serve to help the   41 08-51851  countries that need it most  been established. Liberalization would also have to involve an increase in productivity and the development of human resources  basic infrastructures  access to technology and knowledge including respect for the environment. In other words  it would have to contribute to sustainable development  as indicated in the Doha Outcome Document of July 2008.  The current crisis shows the vulnerability of the present system. In that regard  without ignoring hard realities  Andorra fully shares the approaches agreed in Rome in June during the High-Level Conference on World Food Security: the Challenges of Climate Change and Bioenergy. Since 2005  the Government of Andorra has worked on development cooperation with all of the major international bodies  vulnerable countries at their request  NGOs and civil society.  In the current context and in accordance with the call from world leaders  major international actors and international specialized and regional organizations  we have assisted the most affected countries through financial contributions to FAO and NGO initiatives. We also cooperate on support for agricultural trade and production in Burkina Faso  Colombia and Morocco through NGOs active in the field. For that reason  we endorse the future options being used to maintain biological diversity  sustainable forestry practices and the adaptation of new technology that can help to promote ecological balance and slow the effects of climate change.  Demographic growth on a planet that already has more than 6.7 billion inhabitants; chemical and industrial pollution; ill-adapted land use; desertification and water; the interaction of animal  vegetable and horticultural species; international trade and the movements of peoples are all destabilizing factors that are now upon us and very real. We have to address them with all the means available to us. Guaranteeing food for everyone on our planet is basic  essential and vital. Sixty-three years ago we thought that today  in the twenty-first century  this would be a fact  an outdated concept  a matter achieved  the success of our dreams. Sadly  we were wrong. Now  we need to be strong. To keep going and face up to the most pessimistic forecasts which warn us of the failure of the Millennium Development Goals.  We have made the diagnosis  we are aware that the policies we have encouraged in recent decades have not fulfilled our expectations. But we still have time to rectify this and for this reason I would like to congratulate both the Secretary-General for his initiatives and the rest of the international bodies and civil society for the specific actions they are implementing around the world.  Speeches  reports and fine words are necessary but we suffer from a serious inability to act. Let us not hide behind excuses. Let us take action based on the facts. The dignity of every human being obliges us to do so and humanity deserves it! "
"5",192,"ARE",63,2008,"On behalf of the United Arab Emirates  I have the pleasure to express to you  Mr. President  and to your friendly country our sincere congratulations on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session. I would also like to thank your predecessor  Mr. Srgjan Kerim  for successfully guiding the proceedings of the previous session. I should also take this opportunity to express my gratitude to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his unceasing efforts to strengthen the Organization and re-energize its role in international affairs.  The United Arab Emirates has made major progress in a number of domestic areas. For example  we have increased the representation of women in our executive and legislative bodies  including by expanding their effective participation in the labour market. We are developing national laws on the protection of and respect for human rights and are making significant efforts to improve the welfare of those with special needs. Attempts are also under way to enact legislation to regulate foreign workers in order to ensure their full rights. In keeping with our commitments under relevant bilateral and international agreements  we are also increasing our efforts to combat human trafficking and to provide protection and all the necessary support for its victims.  With regard to the environment  the United Arab Emirates attaches great importance to environmental issues. In cooperation with the Worldwide Fund for Nature  we have launched a number of ambitious strategic programmes  such as the development of Masdar City  which will be the world’s first carbon- and waste-free city  completely dependent on renewable and clean technologies such as solar energy  which will be used to generate power and desalinate of water.  Foreign aid has an important place on our national agenda. We have continued to provide various types of financial and humanitarian assistance to many countries to help them to fund their development programmes and infrastructure projects. Directly and through our membership in the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs Donor Support Group and our contributions to the specialized agencies and programmes of the United Nations  we are also providing assistance to those who have suffered from wars and natural disasters.  In order to alleviate the suffering of millions of people as a result of rising food prices  my country has dispatched 2 million tons of wheat to Yemen  Syria and Egypt. Also as part of our foreign aid  we have provided additional financial assistance to help several developing countries adjust to the phenomenal increase in their energy costs.  In that regard  we would like to express our concern about the repercussions of the financial crisis in international markets. We reiterate that this matter urgently calls for a joint international mechanism that will contribute to the establishment of strong and transparent rules to regulate international financial markets.   The way in which development has taken place in the United Arab Emirates provides a vivid example of tolerance and coexistence. We hope to enrich and strengthen those values through our educational and cultural programmes  for we strongly believe that interaction between different nations and peoples is both of fundamental importance and an essential prerequisite for the achievement of stability  welfare and prosperity in our region.  A/63/PV.13   08-53122 32   The United Arab Emirates therefore attaches great importance to radically restructuring and modernizing our educational system to align it with technological and educational innovations so that it meets the needs and requirements of our development programmes. We also believe that providing education for all is one of the major and significant issues facing us. It is essential that we devote all our resources to it  for in education lies the hope that we can break the evil cycle of poverty and ignorance  which in turn lead to the creation of a fertile environment in which terrorism and extremism can take root and grow.  Iran’s ongoing occupation since 1971 of the United Arab Emirates’` three islands of Abu Musa and Greater and Lesser Tunb is an issue of central importance to us. From this rostrum  I would like to reiterate our firm position demanding the full restoration of our full sovereignty over the three occupied islands and their territorial waters  airspace  continental shelf and exclusive economic zone. The islands are part and parcel of our national sovereignty. We reiterate that all actions and measures  whether military or administrative  undertaken by Iran since its occupation of the three islands are null and void. Iran’s actions have no legal effect. We therefore renew our call to the international community to urge Iran to respond positively to the sincere appeals of the United Arab Emirates  the Gulf Cooperation Council and the League of Arab States by agreeing to resolve the issue through committed and serious direct negotiations or by referring the dispute to the International Court of Justice.  We strongly believe in making the Middle East  including the Arabian Gulf  a zone free from weapons of mass destruction. That would require compelling Israel to comply with United Nations resolutions by bringing its nuclear facilities into compliance with the safeguards regime of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and unconditionally signing the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  as other countries of the region have done. We also urge the Islamic Republic of Iran to continue its cooperation with the IAEA and the international community in order to dispel fears and suspicions related to the nature and objectives of its nuclear programme. We also call on all other stakeholders to commit themselves to continuing to address that issue through political and diplomatic means in order to avoid escalation and achieve a peaceful solution that can ensure stability and security for the region and its peoples.  Based on our firm belief in the right of countries to develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes in accordance with the safeguards regime of the IAEA  the United Arab Emirates urges developed nations to support the legitimate needs of developing countries for access to nuclear energy by providing them with the best possible access to the equipment  nuclear materials and technological and scientific know-how related to peaceful purposes. The United Arab Emirates believes that its peaceful nuclear programme provides a practical and responsible example of transparency in meeting our energy needs  while at the same time we pledge not to engage in enrichment or reprocessing  with the support of the organizations and institutions of some friendly countries and under the supervision of the IAEA.  On another front  the United Arab Emirates has continuously spared no effort to support and promote every regional and international effort to help the Government of Iraq and its people. It is our hope that the latest initiatives of the United Arab Emirates  including the write-off of more than $7 billion in debt and interest due and the re-opening of our embassy in Baghdad  will contribute to promoting economic development and strengthening the political process. That will require the renunciation of all communal and sectarian violence and full commitment to the unity  sovereignty and stability of Iraq  the preservation of its Arab identity and the rejection of any attempts to divide or fragment the country.  With regard to the Middle East  the United Arab Emirates has strongly supported the Palestinian-Israeli peace process  including final status negotiations and the outcome of the Annapolis Conference. In that context  we would like to express our concerns about the lack of earnest in Israel’s attitude towards those negotiations. We call on the international community  and in particular the Security Council and the members of the Quartet  to press Israel to lift the siege it has imposed on the Palestinian people and to implement international resolutions related to freezing all of its illegal settlement activity  dismantling unlawful settlements and ending its occupation of all Palestinian and Arab territories occupied since 1967  including the holy city of Jerusalem  the Golan Heights and some Lebanese territories. Ending the occupation would bring Israel into compliance with relevant international  A/63/PV.13 33 08-53122  resolutions  the road map and the Arab peace initiative. It would also ensure the establishment of an independent Palestinian State with Jerusalem as its capital  as well as Israel’s security.  My country has cooperated effectively and consistently with every effort to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations  including money-laundering. We shall continue to do so in order to rid the world of that scourge and its causes. At the same time  we re-emphasize our support for all activities to promote dialogue among civilizations and enhance the spirit of tolerance among all faiths.  In closing  I would like to stress the need for full compliance with the Charter of the United Nations and international law in meeting the daunting challenges ahead. I hope that this session will produce international consensus on how to address those challenges for the benefit of humankind.  "
"6",239,"ARG",63,2008,"As the first female head of State in the history of my country  I would like to address this Assembly by speaking first on the issue of human rights. Members know that  for my country  the policy of unrestricted respect for and promotion of human rights is one of our State policies.   In that context  I would like to urge that the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance — which was so energetically promoted by our country and which I  co-signed  as First Lady of the Argentine Republic  in Paris last year together with 73 other delegations — be ratified by all countries that have signed it. Thus far  only four countries — Argentina  Albania  Mexico and Honduras — have ratified it. I know that the Republic of France will soon be ratifying it  but it is indispensable that we all strongly commit to ensuring that the inviolability of persons be one of the guiding principles for all States.   In this context  I would also like to put forward the Latin American Initiative for the Identification of Disappeared Persons. I would like to say that  together with the Guatemalan Foundation for Forensic Anthropology  the Argentine Forensic Anthropology Team and the Peruvian Forensic Anthropology Team  we are promoting this initiative to establish genetic identity banks to enable us to report precisely on violations of human rights and properly identify victims.   We deem invaluable the testimony of the women who are with us here at the Assembly today  members of Las Abuelas de Plaza de Mayo — the Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo — who envisioned the creation of this genetic information bank. They have been able to recover  from oblivion and disappearance  95 of the 500 grandchildren who disappeared  children of those political prisoners who disappeared under the former dictatorship in Argentina.   The work of these women is living witness to how  even amidst adversity and against all that State terrorism — not just in my country but in other republics — has meant  it is possible to overcome death and fight for life. The recovery of these children shows how important — how crucial — it is to support this type of initiative and underlines the importance of the work that has been done to identify the victims of the Balkan wars and those of the 11 September attack on the World Trade Center.   In the fight against impunity  which is a State policy in the Republic of Argentina  we cannot fail to mention an issue that  for us  is undoubtedly another cornerstone of this inexhaustible struggle. My country  the Republic of Argentina  suffered two attacks  in 1992 and 1994: the 1992 bombing of the Israeli Embassy and the 1994 bombing of the Argentine Israelite Mutual Association (AMIA) building.   Last year  before this very Assembly  former President Kirchner asked INTERPOL to ratify the arrest warrants issued by my country’s Ministry of Justice against Iranian citizens accused of participating in the AMIA building bombing. Days later  INTERPOL ratified them  and international arrest warrants were issued accordingly. I call upon the Islamic Republic of Iran  in compliance with international law  please to agree that the Argentine justice system can bring to trial in public  transparent courts  and with the full guarantees given by a democratic system  those citizens who stand accused.   Before all the countries of the world brought together in this Assembly  and with the conviction I have always held that innocence must be respected until an individual has been convicted and sentenced by a competent judge  I would like to affirm that  in my country  those citizens will have a fair and public trial with their full participation  with all the guarantees afforded by Argentine law and by the oversight of the international community. Given the gravity of these events  this would guarantee to the Islamic Republic of Iran that there would be fairness  truth and justice in that trial.  I would thus urge once again that  in compliance with international law and because ensuring access to justice is what truly shows how we respect truth  justice and freedom  this request from the Argentine justice system  accepted by INTERPOL  be respected. That would undoubtedly contribute to providing truth for all — not just for Argentines  but for the entire international community — at a time when truth and justice are elusive values internationally.     08-51570 24   In this Hall  as we have been doing since 2003  I would also like to call for the reform of our multilateral bodies — not only of the United Nations  which includes us all  but also of the multilateral financial institutions as well. That involves us all  and it is necessary to recreate a multilateralism which has been lost  leading to a far more insecure world. The Organization needs to be reformed  not just from the point of view of dogmatic approaches to the world  but to meet the real need of all States to ensure the functional  operational and results-oriented character of the activities and interventions of the Organization.  In this context  I would modestly like to put forward an example from our region  South America  of how we were recently able to demonstrate that multilateralism can be achieved  despite differences of approach and vision that different Governments in our region may have.   Here I am looking at the President Evo Morales — the legitimate President of our sister Republic of Bolivia. I would like to say that  a few days ago  the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) met in support of the democratic legitimacy of that country. In a concrete multilateral exercise  heads of State  who do not always share the same viewpoints or interests when we take decisions  were able to work unanimously to forge a resolution and plan of action to help our sister Republic of Bolivia  affected by those who do not respect the democratic will of the people freely expressed through elections.   That is not our only experience of multilateralism. Previously  at the meeting of the Rio Group in the Dominican Republic  at the time of the incident between the sister Republics of Ecuador and Colombia  heads of State intervened and were able to navigate a conflict which  on the basis of history  in other situations would surely have degenerated into an armed conflict between two sister countries.   What I want to say with this is that  for us  the exercise of multilateralism is not simply a hackneyed speech. It is a deeply-held conviction and a concrete and objective policy  showing results in what are normally called emerging regions  where we are capable of giving examples of multilateral collaboration in overcoming conflicts.   The other reform that we have always promoted is that of the multilateral credit institutions  but fundamentally the reform of an economic model that placed the generation of wealth at the centre of the fictional economy and of the world of finances. Recent days show that those matters  those positions  were not the result of an ideological bias or closed dogmas but of objective and timely observation of what was going on.   Today  we cannot speak of the “caipirinha effect” or the “tequila effect” or the “rice effect”  or the effect that always showed that the crisis moved from the emerging countries towards the centre. Today  if we were to give it a name  we would have to say  perhaps  the “jazz effect”  which moves from the centre of the first economy of the world and spreads to the rest of the world. That situation does not make us content or happy.  Quite the contrary  we consider this an historic opportunity to review behaviour and policies  because during the period of the Washington Consensus  we — the countries of South America — were told that the market would solve everything  that the State was not necessary  that State intervention was something for which groups that had not understood how the economy had developed were nostalgic. However  now we are seeing the most formidable State intervention in memory from exactly the place where we had been told that the State was not necessary  in the framework  moreover  of an incredible fiscal and trade deficit.   My country  the Argentine Republic — which  if it continues to grow at the rates at which it has been growing since 2003  will this year be completing the largest economic growth cycle of its almost 200-year history — has always upheld the need for a State presence  fundamentally because the market does not assign resources to the most vulnerable sectors and because we see the State as connecting the interests of society and market interests.   Since 2003  an Argentina that had been in debt up to as much as 160 per cent of its GDP has today reduced its debt to almost 50 per cent of GDP. We have fully paid our debt to the International Monetary Fund (IMF)  and about 15 days ago we announced that we will settle our debt with the Paris Club  which had a cut-off date of 10 December 1983 — the very year when the first democratic President took office  after the dictatorship. Here in New York yesterday  in the Council on Foreign Relations  I announced that Argentina has received a proposal from three very important banks that represent bond-holders who did   25 08-51570  not participate in the 2005 bond exchange and who are proposing to do so in conditions more favourable for my country  Argentina  than those of the 2005 exchange.   Thus we believe not only that our strategy has been correct but that it is absolutely necessary for all of us to review  with a great deal of intellectual humility  what is happening today in the markets and see what are the possible solutions for overcoming the situation. We emerging countries have a great advantage in what we do not have: no credit risk agency will come  nobody from the IMF will come tell us what to do  a great country that has grown on the basis of its real economy and today really has problems on the basis of a casino economy or a fictional economy  where it was thought that only capitalism can produce money. I always say that capitalism was invented in order to earn money  but on the basis of the production of goods  services and knowledge. Money alone does not produce more money. It has to go through the circuit of production  work  knowledge  services and goods so that there can be a virtuous cycle that can generate well-being for the whole of society.   Finally  I want to mention a matter that affects not only my country  beyond its geographical location  but also concerns this Assembly and also the need to face the twenty-first century without colonial enclaves. Here I refer to the issue of our Malvinas Islands  where  despite the resolutions of this body  despite all the measures taken here for the United Kingdom to agree  in virtue of what is set out in Article 33 of the Charter of the United Nations  to negotiate in peace between the parties  that country resolutely refuses to discuss with the Argentine Republic the issue of the Malvinas Islands.   I believe that a member of the Security  Council — one that is among the principal nations of the world in the defence of freedom  human rights and democracy — should give concrete proof that it is not just talk but that it is truly convinced that it is necessary to end this shame  that of a colonial enclave in the twenty-first century. I want to request again  as have the different Presidents who preceded me — because Malvinas is for Argentineans a State policy as well — the cooperation that this body has always provided to once again urge the United Kingdom to agree to comply with international law and to demonstrate that it is serious in wishing to build a different world and a different citizenry.   Lastly  I wish to speak to all those men and women who have institutional governmental responsibilities in any of the branches of the State in their respective countries to once again advocate for the transformation of an international policy that has its fullest expression in this House. The reform of the instruments that we are requesting is not simply a question of cosmetics and formulas and changes that barely conceal that everything is continuing as it stands. The present situation  the complexity of the world that is coming  in terms of food and energy  requires all of us to re-examine our behaviour and our paradigms. We must accept with humility that it is necessary to build a world that is different from the one we have had to date — one in which respect for human rights  for the will of peoples and for those who are different  do not think as we do or who pray to a different god is not merely a catalogue of good intentions set out in the United Nations Charter  but a reality that is experienced a little more concretely every day. "
"7",264,"ARM",63,2008,"First  allow me to express gratitude to Srgjan Kerim  President of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session  for his able leadership. I would also like to congratulate and wish success to its current President  Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann.  I am representing a country that  during the last several weeks  has found itself in a situation that is unacceptable for the twenty-first century.  Once again blood was shed in the South Caucasus and once again innocent people died because we  the leaders  failed to bring a peaceful resolution to an existing conflict. The armed conflict  which erupted in a matter of hours  threatened not only the entire region but well beyond it.  Recently  the unsettling expression “cold war” has re-emerged. I hold the view that the main task of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session should be to issue a collective rejection of such developments. Memories of the previous cold war are very fresh and its consequences linger still.  In that regard  I believe that our main task should be the establishment of a new  dependable and viable structure. The challenges facing humankind in recent decades have been transformed and reshaped in such a way that they cannot be addressed exclusively with the structures established after the Second World War. We continue to respond to today’s horizontal  interwoven challenges — such as terrorism  international crime  drug trafficking and others — through institutions that were designed predominantly to settle disputes among States. Regional cooperation can be a core means of addressing those new challenges. Armenia has always advocated such cooperation and is confident that it is one of the most effective means of addressing problems among States. In that regard  open borders  interconnecting lines of communication and interrelated economic systems are crucial.  The United Nations was among the first institutions to respond to the current global problems resulting from rising food and fuel prices. That phenomenon represents a real threat to all the countries of the world. For poor countries  its consequences will be devastating. Unfortunately  even in such circumstances we continue to witness unilateral sanctions and border closings. In the face of global challenges  countries should work together to prevent the further deterioration of the situation and to implement the sustainable development agenda. Otherwise  we will jeopardize our collective efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals.  Neighbouring States have always had and will continue to have problems with each other. However  those problems cannot be solved if there is no    08-51845 10  dialogue. With that in mind  and taking advantage of a football game between our national teams  I invited the President of Turkey to Yerevan. I welcomed the bold decision of President Gül to accept the invitation  which made him my co-author in the “football diplomacy” initiative.  We discussed an array of bilateral and regional issues. The most important outcome was our decision not to leave current problems to future generations. I am confident that the time has come to solve Armenian-Turkish problems  and on that issue I observed a similar resolve on the part of President Gül. I am certain that it is necessary to move fast and resolutely in that direction.  The events of the past few weeks shocked the South Caucasus region and made it a focal point of the international media. I believe that they hold very serious lessons for us all. I would mention only two.  First  we Member States must adhere strictly to the letter and spirit of the United Nations Charter. If any country rapidly increases its military budget and brags about it; if arms limitations stipulated under international agreements are openly violated; and if a country has signed a ceasefire agreement  which constitutes an international responsibility  but threatens to resume military action on any pretext  we must respond swiftly and firmly. Prevention is preferable to cure  and a potential military conflict must be averted at the planning stage. We must confirm unequivocally that the violation or threat of violation of an existing ceasefire contains elements of aggression.  Secondly  the time has come to seriously consider the right of peoples to self-determination. We continue to witness in our own time how the mere mention of self-determination may be tantamount to a declaration of suicidal intent. One of the basic principles of international law — the right of peoples to self-determination — has become grounds for exile  ethnic cleansing or genocide. There is no doubt in my mind that it need not be that way in the twenty-first century.  We do not insist on the idea that each claim to self-determination should be resolved through secession. However  we have seen that outcome become the solution to conflicts more often than not. When a nation finally has the opportunity to exercise its inalienable right  it is immediately categorized as an exceptional case. That seems to have become a pattern. There is no doubt that  if it is to be viable  such a solution must be endorsed by all the parties involved. That is why we continue to negotiate actively with Azerbaijan in the framework of the Minsk Group of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in seeking that country’s recognition of the Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh  which has been de facto independent for almost two decades.  The people of Nagorno-Karabakh  who followed the legal path in declaring their desire for self-determination  were subjected to a brutal war. For years they hovered on the brink of extinction. At that time  Nagorno-Karabakh was only an autonomous region with neither a regular army  arms and ammunition  nor any intention of or ability to occupy Azeri territory. I think it is at the very least unfair to label as “occupants” people who fought for their right to exist; and yet  Azerbaijan has done just that  even from this high rostrum.  In my country  even schoolchildren are very familiar with the United Nations. Such children — the future leaders of my country and of the world — may not have a profound understanding of the United Nations Charter  but they know that the Organization was created to ensure peace and security for humankind  to promote friendship among nations  to solve problems jointly  and to protect human rights. The schoolchildren of my country trust the United Nations  since in their eyes it is primarily the building with the “pretzel gun” memorial before it.  Some months ago within this building  resolution 62/243 was adopted with only 39 States out of 146 voting in favour. The resolution was adopted in response to an episode in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. A fundamental and sensitive problem with deep roots and painful and bloody developments  and for which immense efforts have been made to secure a peaceful settlement  was decided upon by the majority in support of one of the parties.  The outcome was more than predictable — a new wave of belligerent statements in Azerbaijan  false encomiums  political speculation and so on. However  the voting in Azerbaijan seemed to be little more than window-dressing. I hope that the real interests of Azerbaijan lie not in its misrepresentation at the international level of the different elements of the conflict  but rather in a peaceful and comprehensive resolution  which is equally in the interests of the   11 08-51845  Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh and the Republic of Armenia.   The process mediated by the Co-Chairs of the Minsk Group is aimed at reaching precisely that goal  and I believe that it was in that understanding that almost four fifths of the United Nations membership abstained in the voting or did not vote at all on that resolution. The voting records of the United States  France and Russia — the most well-informed third parties regarding the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and its resolution — are ample demonstration of that fact.  Is it absolutely necessary to shed blood to understand that frozen conflicts demand an expert and conscientious approach and cannot be solved through discussions in various forums? We have worked in earnest under the mediation of the OSCE Minsk Group Co-Chairs. Is it not possible to at least abstain from creating new challenges to the process? Is it not our mutual goal to erect a pretzel gun monument for the Armenian and Azeri children of our region? I assure the General Assembly that those kids deserve one.  This year  we will celebrate two significant achievements in international law: the sixtieth anniversaries of the adoptions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. For us Armenians  as for other peoples that have survived genocide  those anniversaries are more than important. Armenia has done and will continue to do everything it can at the United Nations to provide for the continuous advocacy of the genocide Convention and its enforcement. Genocide cannot be the concern of one nation alone; genocide is a crime against humanity.  As for the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  we fully realize that Armenia  as a young democracy  has important work ahead in order to guarantee the full and efficient implementation of the entire complex of human rights. To that end  we are trying to learn from countries with extensive experience and not to repeat others’ mistakes. Those lessons are not always easy to take  but we are confident that  for a country like Armenia  they are a fundamental guarantee of sustainable development. At the same time we realize that  in a rapidly changing reality  along with scientific progress and advances in information technologies  the protection of human rights and the processes to monitor States’ fulfilment of that obligation should be seriously reviewed and reconsidered. "
"8",297,"ATG",63,2008,"I wish at the outset to extend heartiest congratulations and assurances of my cooperation and highest esteem to Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session. Antigua and Barbuda looks forward to his leadership and guidance throughout this session. Our congratulations also go to his predecessor  Mr. Kerim  on a job well done and for his service to the international community.   I venture to express the hope that the Group of 77 (G-77) and China will find in the President a vigorous advocate for heightened focus and meaningful action in pursuit of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and other agreed development goals.  The sixty-third session of the General Assembly is taking place against a backdrop of escalating challenges to international peace and security: unalleviated poverty and diminishing food supplies for much of the world’s population; mega-disasters induced by climate change; and impending meltdown in the world’s largest economy. These times and circumstances call for a heightened sense of urgency and a stronger will among all nations to work with and through the United Nations in embracing multilateralism in the fullest sense.   The climate crisis is a clear and present threat to the security of small island States like ours and a major obstacle to the achievement of our sustainable development goals and objectives. The international community is not short of rhetoric on the climate issue  nor is it short of ideas  but we have come up woefully short of political will on the part of those whose actions matter most.   The nexus of climate change and natural disasters is indisputable. Natural disasters are increasing in frequency and devastation around the globe. Such disasters are especially catastrophic for the small countries of the Caribbean  whose economies are    08-51845 32  largely dependent on the natural environment. I commend the United Nations and its organs for the work they are doing in Haiti and elsewhere in the Caribbean  which was severely affected by hurricanes over the past weeks. I must  however  call on the international community to lend additional support to the United Nations in its humanitarian efforts in the developing world.  The emerging focus on new energy sources in the United States and elsewhere is also happening to small nations. We are encouraged by the promise of a rollback of the primary contributors to the causes of climate change. The responsibility to provide the necessary resources to do that must be born primarily by those developed countries which contribute most to the causes of climate change.   In a similar context  vulnerable developing societies are victims to the globalization of crime  notably in the havoc wrought by handguns in the possession of criminal elements  the trafficking of narcotics destined essentially for markets in developed countries  and the deportation of criminals to our shores. We urge the international community  in recognition of the link between globalization and crime  to provide greater support for the efforts of small island States to fight crime  strengthen the rule of law and combat international drug trafficking. We also call on developed countries to stop the practice of deporting violent criminals to our shores.  Antigua and Barbuda is also keenly concerned about the issue of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. The Caribbean is a zone of peace  but none of us is beyond the impact and effect of weapons of mass destruction. The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons should be fully implemented and adhered to by all countries.   The constant threat that terrorism poses in today’s highly globalized world makes nuclear disarmament even more imperative. We will continue to promote a nuclear-free zone in Latin America and the Caribbean  and encourage all countries  particularly the leading industrialized nations  to vigorously pursue and support disarmament.   I have looked critically at some of the problems facing the global family of nations. I conclude on a note of optimism.   We have recently seen a number of leaders apologizing to the African diaspora  to indigenous peoples and to former colonies for past wrongs and injustices. We have even seen binding commitment to reparation  as in the case of Italy and Libya. I salute those leaders who have demonstrated such enlightenment.   More Governments are accepting the inevitability of democratic political change and are showing a growing commitment to good governance  fair and free elections and the orderly transfer and sharing of power. Kenya  Zimbabwe and South Africa come to mind immediately and deserve commendation.  Finally  it is fascinating how both candidates in the United States presidential election are vying for the change franchise in that country. As a representative of the Government and people of Antigua and Barbuda  I call on the United States administration and its future leadership to effect change in its dealings with our brother nation of the Republic of Cuba.   I call on the United States to end the economic  commercial and financial embargo imposed on our brothers and sisters in Cuba. As a world leader and defender of justice  the United States must embrace change fully in the interests of the men  women and children of Cuba.   I firmly believe that the United Nations would be a more potent entity and the world could be infinitely better placed if the next president of the United States in his inauguration address gave an irrevocable commitment to multilateralism in all its dimensions.  Permit me in my capacity as the Chair of the G-77 and China to offer a few comments on behalf of the group.  The United Nations and the broader international community have spent much time and other resources over two decades identifying  defining and reaching a common understanding on major challenges to global society. We have passed resolutions and declarations in which we have defined the challenges  identified the resources needed and resolved and committed to meeting and overcoming the challenges as a global community through international cooperation. In some cases  we have agreed and set binding time frames to achieve results.  Many of these commitments  timetables and proposals for action have been repeated in annual   33 08-51845  resolutions of the General Assembly. Unfortunately  many have become more technically complicated  while there has been less and less political commitment to action supporting their unified and mutually reinforcing implementation.  We have had some modest gains  as  for example  in our fight against HIV/AIDS and malaria. However  in general  our record of implementation and delivery on commitments is a source of embarrassment to us as leaders.  We are confronted by an endemic crisis of development  including the failure of development policies and approaches that do not take into account the specific situation of countries and regions.  This has resulted in growing inequities within and across countries  an environmental and climate change crisis with unsustainable pressures on production and ecosystems  a global economic and financial crisis spreading from the major economies  a crisis of confidence in global governance and institutional capacity for managing international trade  finance and development policies  a worsening energy crisis  an unprecedented food crisis  and a looming water crisis.  We recognize that each country has the primary responsibility for its development. However  the international community must create a conducive  sustainable  fair and predictable environment and provide the necessary policy space to stimulate and facilitate the discharge of this responsibility.  We must all move immediately into implementation mode — a mode where our focus is on how to do rather than how not to do. We have some important strategic opportunities ahead to begin to do so.  The G-77 and China believe that we could begin with today’s high-level meeting of the General Assembly on the Millennium Development Goals.  At the midpoint we  as an international community  are in danger of missing most of the MDG targets. We have not provided the resources  the conducive international environment and the cooperation to ensure that all developing countries can meet their specific targets.  Several sources were identified in Monterrey through which the financing could be mobilized to address the commitments to tackle many of the challenges  including those summarized in the Millennium Development Goals.  Let us use the process leading up to the Follow-up International Conference on Financing for Development  and the Conference itself  to offer specific proposals on how we will provide and use resources  and on how we will set about shaping the international economic environment in order to speed achievement of those objectives and targets  as well as increase the participation of developing countries.  In December 2007  the Bali process reaffirmed the international community’s resolve to ensure that  by the end of 2009  it will have a clear idea about commitments from Annex 1 Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) on greenhouse gas-reduction for the second commitment period  as well as their commitments on firm actions and resources to facilitate adaptation  mitigation  technology transfer and financing for Non-Annex 1 Parties.  The outcomes of the United Nations Climate Change Conference to be held in Copenhagen in 2009 must be robust and implementation-driven. The various intergovernmental activities on the energy and food crises scheduled for the coming months should be focused not only on solutions to the immediate problems of food insecurity and energy issues  but also on long-term sustainable developmental imperatives.  These are illustrations of the opportunities which can and should be used by the international community to foster implementation of both outstanding and new commitments. They are by no means exhaustive. The Group of 77 and China would urge the General Assembly to resolve to promptly send a message communicating the urgency of implementing those various processes and activities. "
"9",344,"AUS",63,2008,"I would like to congratulate Mr. d’Escoto Brockmann on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session. The Australian delegation looks forward to working closely with him throughout the session.  We gather together at a time of great challenge to the international system — a challenge that reminds us afresh that we live in a world where our interdependence is now greater than at any time before  an interdependence that therefore demands our international cooperation now more than at any time before.  There are many who criticize the United Nations. And those of us who know this institution well know that it is not immune to criticism. But those who argue against this Organization advance no credible argument as to what should replace it. Whatever its imperfections  the United Nations represents a necessary democracy of States — States who resolved  out of the carnage of the last world war  that cooperation should always be preferred to conflict  that our national interests are invariably best served by the simultaneous prosecution of the international interest  and that the purposes of our common humanity should prevail over the narrow interests of the few.  When the nations of the world met in San Francisco in 1945  the United Nations was conceived as a bold experiment — one that ran contrary to the grain of the international order that had preceded it  where conflict was the norm and cooperation the exception; one in which the international community  for the first time  began to imagine how through an international institution we could not just protect the sovereignty of States  but equally advance the protection of peoples and the dignity of individuals.  Beyond that  we began to advance the idea that through the other great international institutions — the World Bank  the International Monetary Fund (IMF)  the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the International Labour Organization (ILO) — we could fashion an international economic order that recognized the unfolding reality of economic interdependence.   These were the ideals we set for ourselves more than half a century ago. And while the history of our achievements since then has been mixed  the ideas and the ideals on which these institutions were constructed nonetheless remain as valid now as they were back then.  The failures that we have seen in recent times do not lie in the institutions alone. The failure lies more in the poverty of our political will to animate those institutions to discharge the purposes for which they were created. And that is our collective responsibility.  The global financial crisis of today presents us afresh with a critical opportunity to act comprehensively and collectively for the long term  rather than selectively and separately for the short. In the post-war period  the quantum of financial institutional failure seen these last weeks has been great. The quantum of government intervention in financial markets has been significant. The quantum of the impact by one market on another has been unprecedented. What we have seen in financial markets should bring home to us all that the central organizing principle of this twenty-first century is interdependence.  For the century just past  interdependence may have been one option among many. For the century that is to come  there is no longer an alternative. Interdependence is not the expression of sentimental idealism. Instead  it is a recognition of the new realism of our current times  which represents the cumulative impact of the globalization of our engagement with each other over many decades. Through unprecedented trade flows  unprecedented investment flows and unprecedented financial flows  we now see the globalization of our economy; the globalization of security  arising from the searing impact of 11 September when the obscenity visited on this great city caused us all to conclude that terrorism was the enemy of all civilized humanity  not just of some   37 08-51851  nations; and the globalization of the environment  as we have come to recognize that carbon emissions from one part of the planet affect all parts of the planet and therefore radically affect the future of the planet itself.  What all these things tell us is this: interdependence is the new realism of this twenty-first century. And unless as a community of nations we rise to this new challenge  our future is bleak indeed.  The global financial crisis is a call to the global community to act. Financial markets are a public good. The stability of global financial markets is a public good. If Governments fail to protect this public good  then those who suffer are the working people of the world  whose jobs  whose homes and whose standard of living depend on it.  It is Governments rather than speculators that have the central responsibility for determining the rules that govern the way markets work. A decade ago  the global economy and global financial markets were buffeted by the Asian financial crisis  and as a global community we resolved that we would act to reduce the risk of such systemic crises in the future. The problem is  a decade on  that systemic lessons were not learned.  Now we face a financial crisis of truly global proportions. We must therefore ask ourselves three questions: What went wrong? What needs to be done now to fix the problem of financial market instability for the long term? And most critically  how do we marshal the political will to do so?  First  what went wrong? There has been a failure of internal governance within financial institutions. There has also been a failure of external oversight. Regulators have not always recognized the systemic risk posed by significant financial institutions.  So what must now be done?  The immediate task is to rebuild confidence in the financial system by ensuring that central banks provide adequate liquidity  by enabling the recapitalization of critical financial institutions and by ensuring their continued solvency. Over the longer term  the challenge is to reform financial markets and regulatory systems so as to reduce the chances of these events repeating themselves in the future. To this end  together with other States  we would argue that the following reform programme be implemented.  First  systemically important financial institutions should be licensed to operate in major economies only under the condition that they make full disclosure and analysis of balance sheet and off-balance sheet exposures. Systemically important financial institutions are not just commercial banks but can include investment banks  insurance companies  hedge funds and financial clearing houses.  Which institutions are systemically important will vary in a given country over time. The central bank in each country should have responsibility for the stability of the financial system. That should be embedded in globally agreed best-practice standards for financial regulation and should be assessed by the IMF.   Secondly  we need to ensure that banks and other financial institutions build up capital in good times as a buffer for bad times  using predictable rules. Supervisory frameworks need to be countercyclical  not pro-cyclical. The Basel rules need to address this.  Thirdly  financial institutions need to have a clear incentive to promote responsible behaviour rather than unrestrained greed. Regulators should set higher capital requirements for financial firms that have executive remuneration packages rewarding short-term returns or excessive risk taking. Again  the Basel rules need to address this.  Fourthly  supervisory systems must be compatible with accounting principles that reflect reasonable assessments of the value of assets over time. We need to make sure that accounting rules foster a more medium-term perspective and that they do not encourage institutions to believe that risk is low merely because current asset prices are high or recent asset-price volatility has been low. The Basel rules also need to address this.  Fifthly  the IMF should be given a strengthened mandate for prudential analysis. Conservative and consistent prudential standards should be applied to all financial institutions of systemic significance. Furthermore  the IMF and the Financial Stability Forum should develop early warning systems that signal impending institutional vulnerabilities and provide advice on remedial policies. Collectively  those institutions have led the development of the initiatives that represent the core of the financial-market reform agenda that I have just described. However  those institutions are  by their very nature  bureaucratic  and    08-51851 38  the reform processes they initiate are constrained by a lack of political authority.   That brings me to the third question arising from the current crisis: how are we to go about implementing this reform agenda for the long term?  What is required is political will  exercised through ministerial forums working in cooperation with the IMF  the Financial Stability Forum and the Group of Twenty (G20). The G20 is well placed to provide the political authority to have such actions implemented urgently and comprehensively. In that context  Australia will work intensively with the forthcoming Chairs of the G20 — in particular the United Kingdom in 2009 — to ensure that financial stability is at the centre of the work programme and to initiate arrangements to strengthen G20 input into shaping the work of the IMF and the Financial Stability Forum and the implementation of agreed outcomes.  At their meeting in November  the G20 finance ministers should review the progress made in adopting the current Financial Stability Forum recommendations  reinforce the agreed deadlines for finalizing their implementation and agree with the Forum on a clear timetable for the action plan.  As countries with systemically important economies  G20 members should demonstrate their commitment to best-practice financial regulation and disclosure by providing better information regarding the stability of their domestic financial systems and cross-border exposures to the IMF and the Financial Stability Forum. The IMF and the Financial Stability Forum should provide regular scenario analysis to the G20 to facilitate clear engagement on the risks facing the global financial system. Such analysis should be included in an enhanced version of the IMF’s Global Financial Stability Report.  The purpose of this reform agenda is to provide a real political mandate for our international regulatory institutions to do their job in defending the integrity of the international financial system.  One of the greatest challenges we face is climate change and the threat it poses to the environment. In December last year  after many years of delay  Australia ratified the Kyoto Protocol. We are determined to be part of the solution to climate change  not just a part of the problem. We have acted to begin the process of developing a comprehensive emissions trading or carbon pollution reduction scheme to bring down carbon dioxide emissions over time. We will also implement a national energy efficiency strategy as well as a renewable energy strategy. Developing and deploying new technologies will also be part of our response to climate change.  The Australian Government has decided to establish a global centre to drive the demonstration and commercialization of carbon capture and storage technologies. Building on existing national and regional initiatives  that project will bring together the best researchers in the world to develop the best technology to apply. As the world at present is planning to generate 45 per cent of its electricity from coal by 2030  we can no longer afford to delay acting on such technology. Australia invites all Governments and corporations of goodwill to participate in the Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute.  The United Nations and we  its Member nations  have a responsibility to protect the nations and peoples of the world. We must protect people from terrorism  and that must include a commitment to support those nations on the front lines of the struggle. Australia is working closely with the Government of Afghanistan and with our global partners to bring security and stability to that country. We can never again allow it to become a haven for terrorists.  Australia is also an active contributor to global efforts to prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction. We continue to urge nations to sign and ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty so that it can enter into force.  We remain concerned that States such as Iran and North Korea continue to defy the international community and to fail to comply with demands for a full declaration and accounting of their nuclear programmes. Their actions are undermining the global consensus on containment of the spread of nuclear weapons.  This year  the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) celebrates its fortieth anniversary. As a middle Power and a long-standing member of the NPT  Australia is committed to working with other nations towards the goal of the eventual abolition of nuclear weapons. Australia  together with our close friend and partner Japan  has established an International Commission on Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament to create the political and policy   39 08-51851  consensus necessary to elicit a real result on  non-proliferation and disarmament in advance of the 2010 NPT Review Conference.  The United Nations own security machinery must also be effective. The Security Council needs reform. Australia supports expansion of its permanent membership to reflect changes in the world since 1945  and our nation will be a candidate for a non-permanent seat for the 2013-2014 term. Australia once again wishes to play its part in advancing the international security order.  Prosperity comes from economic growth. It comes from nations trading with one another. That is why it is so important that we conclude the Doha Round of world trade talks this year. It is why we must also implement the Millennium Development Goals  consistent with our solemn commitment in this place at the dawn of this millennium.  Progress in achieving the Goals has been mixed. We need to redouble our efforts to reduce poverty  to provide education for children and to ensure that people in the developing world have access to health care. Australia is committed to increasing its official development assistance to 0.5 per cent of its gross national income by 2015. Australia now resolves to do much more — much  much more — to make poverty history. It is unforgivable that poverty and conflict  such as those in Darfur  continue to claim the lives of innocents in the face of inaction by Governments.   Development is also about protecting human rights. Sixty years ago  this body adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We must commit afresh to protecting the rights that that charter identifies.   As nations  we should also commit afresh to righting past wrongs. In Australia  we began that recently with the first Australians  who have the oldest continuing culture in human history. This year  on behalf of the Australian Parliament  I offered an apology to Indigenous Australians for the wrongs that they had suffered in the past. That was the right thing for Australia to do.  Our membership in the United Nations is a key pillar of our foreign policy. Our priorities are regional  but our interests are global. We work with partners around the world to meet shared challenges. Through our membership in the United Nations  we are committed to using creative middle-Power diplomacy to help overcome the great challenges of our age — challenges that are beyond the power of individual nation-States to resolve  that can be overcome only through unprecedented cooperation between States. That is because the problems that we seek to solve in this Hall and through the organs of the United Nations touch every one of our peoples. To advance prosperity and stability at home  we must advance prosperity and stability around the globe.  Australia was one of the founding Members of the United Nations. Our Foreign Minister at the time  Herbert Evatt  made a significant contribution at the San Francisco Conference  particularly on the part of small and medium-sized countries. He ensured that the role of the General Assembly was protected in the structure of the Organization as a whole.  Sixty years ago this week  he was elected President of the General Assembly at its third session. Evatt was a patriotic Australian. Evatt was equally a passionate internationalist. Sixty years later  this institution  together with other international institutions of our current order  have yet to realize the vision of those who founded it. Yet the need today  in this age of unprecedented global interdependence  is greater than ever before.  And so it falls to this generation to now summon the political faith and to exercise the political will necessary to act for the common purposes of the planet we all share. "
"10",391,"AUT",63,2008,"These days  on our television screens  images of thousands of parents concerned about the health of their babies and children remind us of what lies at the very heart of our work — building a better future for the coming generations  at home as well as here in the United Nations.  Armed conflict  climate change  poverty  hunger and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction are the bleak challenges we face today  together with new global challenges such as increasing food and energy prices and financial turbulence. A sense of shared responsibility and true partnership based on equality are the key qualities that must guide our efforts to meet these challenges.  All inhabitants of the global village have the right as well as the duty to contribute to the well-being of our community. At the global level  that needs to be done in the framework of an effective world organization that enjoys the trust of States and Governments but also of societies and individual citizens.  A just and effective international order needs to be based on rules equally applicable to every member  big or small  strong or weak. Respect for the rule of law is indispensable if we want to prevent conflicts and promote peace and sustainable development. Austria has therefore consistently promoted efforts to develop international relations based on the principles of the    08-52272 40  Charter of the United Nations and all the other instruments that form our international legal system.  Three weeks ago  130 human rights experts and practitioners from around the world came together in Vienna 15 years after the World Conference on Human Rights held in Vienna in 1993. They formulated recommendations on how to overcome the gap between human rights standards and the reality of their implementation on the ground. Those recommendations have been submitted to the General Assembly and the Human Rights Council  and I hope they will contribute to the deliberations on the occasion of the sixtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights on 10 December.  One of the basic threats to the rule of law is impunity. Today  international criminal justice  as dispensed by the International Criminal Court as well as by the special tribunals established by the Security Council  has become a major tool for bringing to justice those responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity.   Nowadays  some speak about the “peace — justice dilemma”. I personally remain convinced that peace and justice are complementary objectives  both are equally essential. There can be no lasting peace without justice  and international justice will serve its purpose most fully and effectively if it helps societies advance reconciliation and overcome the wounds of the past. As women and children are often the most vulnerable in our societies  they deserve our special attention in this context.  No country  no society can succeed without recognizing the contribution of women. Worldwide  women are the politically and socially most relevant emerging power of the twenty-first century. Their contribution must be valued publicly  their participation encouraged  their potential fully used. There are countless success stories of women leaders who make a difference in their communities as businesswomen  mothers  teachers  farmers  workers  peacemakers and lawmakers.  At the same time  we hear appalling reports from around the world of discrimination and violence against women. How can we speak of human rights for women as long as one out of every three women worldwide has been beaten or abused? It is the responsibility of each and every Government to act on this. The United Nations must take the lead by setting clear targets and establishing a network to share best practices in combating violence against women.  Last year  the Women Leaders Network called on the Secretary-General to appoint more women to leadership positions in the United Nations  in particular in mediation and peacebuilding. I am pleased that the Secretary-General has since entrusted a number of outstanding women with key positions both at Headquarters and in the field  and I encourage him to continue this policy.  With regard to Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) on women  peace and security  the European Union (EU) policy of targeted support for women in and through peace missions could be extended to other regional organizations such as the African Union. To assess the practical results of resolution 1325 (2000)  I propose a thorough review process on the occasion of its tenth anniversary in 2010.  Recent events in Georgia are a stark reminder that the scourge of war still haunts our European neighbourhood. The European Union is ready to work together with the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe  the Council of Europe and the United Nations so that Georgia can return to peace  all internally displaced people can return safely and a lasting solution based on full respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia is found. I also call upon the Security Council to decide on a timely prolongation of the United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia.  As for the Western Balkans  I am heartened that we are moving from the crisis management phase to the integration phase. Today  thanks to the stabilizing role of the EU  the peoples of the Western Balkans enjoy peace. Their future lies in the European Union.  Austria welcomes the progress recently achieved in Zimbabwe. We hope that this will become another lasting example of the capacity of Africa for the peaceful resolution of conflicts on its continent. Regional ownership is the best option for success.  Austria continues to actively support efforts to bring an end to decades of conflict in the Middle East. Three months ago  we hosted a donor conference in Vienna for the reconstruction of the Nahr el-Bared refugee camp in northern Lebanon in order to improve the fate of the Palestinian refugees there and to support   41 08-52272  stability  the rule of law and economic development in Lebanon.  I commend the Israeli and Palestinian leadership for their commitment to dialogue and negotiations despite repeated efforts by radical forces to undermine the process started in Annapolis nearly a year ago. Ongoing settlements and expansion  however  put our common vision in question. The two-State solution remains the only possible path towards a peaceful and prosperous Middle East that can provide lasting security to all its inhabitants.  I remain convinced that in international relations as inside our own societies  we must always support dialogue. Austria will continue her long-standing commitment to the dialogue of cultures and religions with a clear focus on the contribution of religious leaders  women  young people  the media and educators.  With some 500 000 victims each year  small arms and light weapons are today’s real weapons of mass destruction. Africa is the continent most heavily affected by this problem. Together with her African partners  Austria works for real progress on the destruction of small arms as well as on the fight against the illicit arms trade. We also cooperate in developing suitable legal instruments.  Austria is also deeply involved in establishing an international legally binding ban on cluster munitions. The Convention on Cluster Munitions that we adopted in Dublin this year is a milestone in the field of disarmament and humanitarian law. Austria will sign the Convention in Oslo on 3 December 2008. I appeal to all other countries to sign as soon as possible so that this treaty can enter into force swiftly.  The need to prevent nuclear proliferation at a time when an increasing number of countries are looking towards nuclear power as a means to produce energy calls for courageous and creative solutions. Austria has presented a proposal in the framework of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that aims at the comprehensive multilateralization of the nuclear fuel cycle. The goal is a fair system under which all States who wish to receive nuclear fuel for an exclusively peaceful use can do so under equal conditions through the IAEA.  With regard to the Iranian nuclear programme  we are convinced that the double-track approach is the best way forward. At the same time  it is indispensable that Iran fully complies with the relevant Security Council resolutions. In this context we commend and strongly support the efforts of the IAEA Director General  Mohamed El Baradei.  Let me draw the Assembly’s attention to the new partnership we developed and adopted at the Lisbon Summit in December 2007: the Joint Africa-European Union Strategy based on the three aims of peace  security and development. Without peace and security there can be no sustainable development  and there is no security without human security. Human trafficking  drugs  proliferation of weapons  unemployment and crime — they all affect the very cohesion of our societies.  In order to better address the challenges faced by Africa  Austria  together with the Economic Community of West African States and the Southern African Development Community  respectively  recently organized a conference on peace and security in West Africa  in Ouagadougou  and a seminar on peace and development in Southern Africa  in Johannesburg.  We need the turbo power of innovation to address global challenges. Climate change is not only responsible for natural disasters but poses what is perhaps the most serious threat to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). For some small island States climate change and the resulting sea level rise are threats to their very existence. Austria therefore welcomes the initiative by the Pacific island States for a General Assembly resolution on the threat of climate change to international peace and security. Urgent action towards a global climate agreement by the end of 2009 is the only way forward. We also propose to develop the United Nations Environment Programme into a fully fledged World Environment Organization. Furthermore  we support the creation of a new International Renewable Energy Agency. Vienna is a suitable location to host such an agency  as many of its United Nations offices already deal with energy questions.  Eradicating extreme poverty and hunger continues to be one of the main challenges of the international community. At the midpoint towards 2015  success in achieving the Millennium Development Goals has been uneven. While many countries have made significant progress in attaining    08-52272 42  some of the Goals  only a few are likely to reach all of them. Urgent and increased efforts by the international community are  therefore  needed. The active contribution towards this global effort is a priority for the Austrian Government.  As a matter of urgency we also have to tackle the multiple and complex causes of the current global food crisis. We welcome the High-Level Task Force set up by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon  which aims to create an international strategy for food security  and we eagerly await the first concrete results.  Small and medium-sized countries have a specific interest in an international system based on effective multilateralism and the rule of law. They form the backbone of the United Nations. They can make a difference and act as a driving force on many issues beneficial to the world community.  Since joining the United Nations more than 50 years ago  Austria has consistently worked for multilateral solutions to global challenges. Our candidature for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council is one expression of our determination to serve the world Organization. That is the most important responsibility that can be entrusted to a Member of the United Nations. We stand ready to assume that responsibility and ask Members for their support. We pledge to work for common solutions to our common global challenges in a sense of true partnership."
"11",416,"AZE",63,2008,"At the outset  I have the honour of congratulating His Excellency Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann of Nicaragua on his election to the post of President of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session. I wish him every success in his endeavours. I would like also to pay tribute to his predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Srgjan Kerim  for his active collaboration with delegations throughout the last session. I wish also to express my profound respect for the able leadership demonstrated by His Excellency Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon in the management of the United Nations.  The effectiveness of the international security system has an impact on the authority of the United Nations. When agreement among Security Council members on approaches to overcoming challenges to world peace seems elusive  the common security and credibility of the United Nations are seriously affected.  We shall respect our shared values and accept the restraints inherent in those values in order to find an approach that is based on a global consensus. The  A/63/PV.13 13 08-53122  Security Council must fully realize its primary responsibility for the collective management of threats that transcend national boundaries and have implications for international security. All of us must strictly follow the Charter as a unique instrument of international relations.  The reform of the United Nations and its Security Council will further improve the credibility of the United Nations system. The success of the reforms will depend on our political willingness to deliver the expected results. We need to harmonize diverging views in order to arrive at a generally acceptable solution that will reflect the universal character of the United Nations and adapt it to present-day realities.  We must enhance the role of the General Assembly as the supreme policymaking organ of the United Nations. It is only by strengthening the Assembly’s mandate that we can successfully tackle some of the most pressing issues facing humanity.  This session is taking place at a very critical juncture for the South Caucasus region and for the international community as a whole. The worrisome events that took place last month in Georgia have clearly shown that restoring stability to the region requires a collective effort to strengthen the international security system.  Obviously  the situation in that region is a matter of concern for us  and Azerbaijan is already making its contribution to reduce tensions. We firmly believe that issues that cause disagreements in the region must be settled peacefully  through dialogue  on the basis of the norms and principles of international law and mutual respect.  The Georgian case has also proved that the protracted conflicts existing in the area of Georgia  Ukraine  Azerbaijan and Moldova (GUAM)  including the Armenia-Azerbaijan Nagorno-Karabakh conflict  remain a major source of instability  and a fragile ceasefire regime cannot be a substitute for lasting peace in the region. Persistence of these conflicts endangers international peace and security and prevents the full utilization of the potential of this strategically important region  situated at the crossroads of Europe and Asia. A resolution of the protracted conflicts in the GUAM area will not only bring immediate benefits to affected countries  but will substantially contribute to stability and regional security.  In that context  the Caucasus Stability and Cooperation Platform initiated by Turkey could serve as a good departure point for building the regional security system. It is of utmost importance to ensure that our common efforts are built on the principles of mutual respect for territorial integrity  recognition of existing borders  equality and good-neighbourliness.  The prerequisite for the establishment of cooperation and good-neighbourly relations in the region is the withdrawal of Armenian troops from the occupied lands and the restoration of the full sovereignty of Azerbaijan over those territories. Only through that can we pave the way for peace and economic prosperity for the entire region.  The earliest possible resolution of the armed conflict in and around the Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan remains a primary task for us. The Government of Azerbaijan is committed to a peaceful settlement of the conflict on the basis of the norms and principles of international law  including relevant Security Council resolutions  General Assembly resolutions and documents of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.  In order to facilitate the negotiation process  Azerbaijan initiated  during the sixty-second session of the General Assembly  consideration of the agenda item entitled  “The situation in the occupied territories of Azerbaijan”. The Assembly comprehensively addressed the issue and adopted resolution 62/243. We highly appreciate the principled support of the States members of the General Assembly for that resolution  which reaffirmed the Assembly’s continued respect and support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Azerbaijan within its internationally recognized borders and demanded the withdrawal of all Armenian forces from all the occupied territories of the Republic of Azerbaijan. The resolution also reaffirmed “that no State shall recognize as lawful the situation resulting from the occupation of the territories of the Republic of Azerbaijan  nor render aid or assistance in maintaining this situation” (resolution 62/243  para. 5). It recognized  “the inalienable right of the population expelled from the occupied territories of the Republic of Azerbaijan to return to their homes  and stresse[d] the necessity of creating appropriate conditions for this return  including the A/63/PV.13   08-53122 14  comprehensive rehabilitation of the conflict-affected territories”. (para. 3)  The Assembly  “[recognized] the necessity of providing normal  secure and equal conditions of life for Armenian and Azerbaijani communities in the Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan  which will allow an effective democratic system of self-governance to be built up in this region within the Republic of Azerbaijan”. (para. 4)  I would like to stress that the principles laid out in the resolution will be used as a basis in the negotiation process. The General Assembly will continue to follow the situation in the occupied territories of Azerbaijan under agenda item 18 of the current session.  In recent years  Azerbaijan has made crucial contributions to strengthening regional stability by promoting security  energy  communications and economic cooperation projects. Production and secure delivery of hydrocarbon resources of the Caspian Sea to international markets has been an important element of Azerbaijan’s foreign and domestic policy. We will continue to carry out a strategy that will substantially improve energy security and economic prospects in the region and beyond.  Another strategic project under implementation is the construction of the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railway linking our country with Georgia and Turkey through a major transport connection. This will create an essentially new and effective communication corridor between East and West  between Europe and Asia.  The economic development and growth of Azerbaijan have been on the rise. The growth rate of our gross domestic product remains one of the highest in the world  and reached 18 per cent in the first nine months of 2008. According to the forecasts of international financial institutions  the growth rate will retain its dynamics for the next year.  Azerbaijan is of the view that facilitating trade offers enormous opportunities to pursue development objectives. Against this background  the joint report of the World Bank and the International Finance Corporation  “Doing Business 2009”  recognized my country as a top reformer in 2007-2008 in implementing business regulatory reforms  and as one of the leading countries with investment-friendly economies. According to the report  out of 181 countries  Azerbaijan was rated first in improving the commercial environment and encouraging business start-ups. Azerbaijan strongly believes that these factors are central in attracting and mobilizing financial resources to support socio-economic development of the country.   In the meantime  we are champions in the implementation of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) and consider the General Assembly’s adoption without a vote of resolution 62/274  on the EITI  as a sign of the global recognition of our efforts.  Protection and promotion of human rights is one of the central duties of the international community. Today  this is not merely a question of protecting individuals; it is fundamental to promoting peace and stability around the globe. Azerbaijan remains actively involved in the work of the United Nations human rights bodies. As a member of the Human Rights Council  we attach great importance to the efficient functioning of the Council. It is our common task and responsibility to ensure that that institution lives up to the expectations vested in it and truly becomes an objective  vigorous and credible universal human rights body.  Azerbaijan is fully committed to all its obligations as a State member of various international organizations to promote democracy  the rule of law and human rights. We believe that through consistent reforms and investments in education  we will achieve long-term stability and prosperity in our part of the world. "
"12",462,"BDI",63,2008,"At the outset  I would like to join previous speakers  on behalf of His Excellency Pierre Nkurunziza  President of the Republic of Burundi  and our entire delegation  in offering our warmest congratulations to Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann on his outstanding election to the presidency. We congratulate the other members of the Bureau as well.  We would also like to pay well-deserved tribute to his predecessor  Mr. Srgjan Kerim  for the skill and wisdom with which he guided the work of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. We also take this opportunity to congratulate Mr. Ban Ki-Moon once again on the skill and dynamism with which he is guiding our Organization. We would also like to pay special tribute to his tireless devotion to the cause of peace and development in Burundi as we attempt to consolidate peace and stability.  Finally we wish to thank the United Nations Integrated Office in Burundi.  The sixty-third session of the General Assembly is taking place at a time when the people of Burundi are at last enjoying the end of the war between the Government army and the Parti Libération du Peuple Hutu-Forces nationale de libération (PALIPEHUTU-FNL). The representatives of both parties have been sitting at the same table since May  seeking to identify the ways and means to implement the Comprehensive Ceasefire Agreement signed in Tanzania on 7 September 2006. Allow us to also thank the international community  the United Nations  the African Union and the Regional Peace Initiative on Burundi for their participation in the return of the leaders of the PALIPEHUTU movement to Burundi. We also take this opportunity to call on that movement to commit itself resolutely to the peace process  in particular by ending its practice of forcing local populations to supply its fighters. For its part  the Government of Burundi reaffirms that it will spare no effort to ensure progress in the peace process.  This session is taking place three years after the establishment of democratically elected institutions in our country  and it is the first time in our history that an elected Government has lasted more than three years. This is an important stage in democracy. The people in general and the Government in particular welcome that milestone.  Thanks particularly to the support of the Peacebuilding Commission  the Government of Burundi has just launched  throughout the country  dialogue frameworks between the socio-political partners of Burundi: the leaders of political parties  members of Parliament  civil society and the media. They exchange views on the current challenges to our country in order to reach a consensus on the way democracy should function in Burundi. In the framework of promoting a sound justice system and national reconciliation  the Government will soon organize nationwide elections on the machinery for transitional justice.  Our Government is firmly committed to respecting human rights in all their forms. That is no easy task in a country that recently emerged from a civil war that lasted more than 15 years. Nevertheless  a number of measures have been taken and others are under way. An independent national human rights commission and a national children’s forum will soon be launched. Additionally  a new criminal code providing for severe punishment for gender-based    08-52272 10  violence is before Parliament  which is now up and running normally. In the same vein  the Government has established human rights focal points in all ministerial departments and is providing training in that area and in peace education.  I note that in Burundi  security is generally good throughout our national territory  but we are encountering certain forms of insecurity linked to attacks and killings as a result of armed robbery and land disputes. In order to control that phenomenon  the Government has begun to disarm the civil population. That is a very important and difficult measure  particularly because there is a large number of weapons in private hands. We are convinced that  unless those weapons are taken out of circulation and destroyed  peace and security will always be under threat. We therefore count on the support of our development partners to recover all weapons and munitions  particularly once the PALIPEHUTU-FNL combatants have completed the integration process.  Indeed  although our country is arduously recovering from the devastating effects of civil war  its gross domestic product remains among the lowest in the world. The purchasing power of the population has fallen and inflation has risen apace  particularly given the international phenomenon of the generalized increase in the price of food and oil products.  In a different vein  we recently organized a national housing and population census that will provide us with reliable data  without which it would be difficult to carry out sustainable development projects. The results of the census will allow the Government to improve the drafting of school and health policies  to which we pay particular attention  as evidenced by the measures already taken to establish free health care for children under the age of five and women at childbirth  as well as free basic education.  The Government has negotiated and launched macroeconomic and structural reforms that our development partners support. Those reforms are aimed at macroeconomic stabilization  the privatization of State enterprises  and bank and monetary management that is compatible with sustainable growth.  The Government is determined to fight corruption and tax fraud  and to promote real transparency in the management of public wealth. Allow me to recall that an anti-corruption law has been enacted and that an anti-corruption brigade is now operating. The public oversight body is playing its role and we welcome the considerable contribution made by civil society organizations.  Burundi welcomes the ratification of the Pact on Security  Stability and Development in the Great Lakes Region by nine members of the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region. We will  of course  pursue measures to ensure that all member States ratify the Pact.  We recall that Burundi joined the East African Community (EAC) in July 2007. As I address this Assembly  nine Burundian members of Parliament represent my country in the Legislative Assembly of the Community. That integration represents certain challenges for the people and Government of Burundi  particularly with respect to the imminent creation of a common market and a customs union  to culminate in the establishment of a political federation. We take this opportunity to express our gratitude to the States members of EAC  which understand the difficulties facing a country emerging from conflict  such as Burundi  and have implemented measures to assist our integration. Of course  we also count on the support of our development partners to help us in all areas of integration that we consider to be strategic for the political stability and development of the countries of the subregion.  Maintaining peace and security is a multidimensional task subject to the many challenges that our Organization is called upon to address. These include conflict prevention and resolution  combating terrorism  combating the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons and combating poverty  hunger and disease  including the HIV/AIDS pandemic.  The United Nations is mobilizing many efforts and resources to meet those challenges. While it is true that considerable progress has been achieved  our Organization still has much to do  because the way forward is still long. We should also point out that bloody conflicts and hotbeds of tension remain  including in Somalia  Darfur  Iraq  Afghanistan and the Middle East  et cetera. Terrorism is gaining ground all the time and is causing more death than conventional war. But we should not be discouraged. On the contrary  our Organization must demonstrate the capacity to prevent this type of conflict and provide effective remedies for the ills threatening humanity.    11 08-52272   In the name of international solidarity  Burundi has decided to make its modest contribution towards resolving some of those crises  by providing military observers and police officers in Darfur and Côte d’Ivoire  and to military peacekeeping contingents in Somalia in the framework of operations established by the African Union.  Burundi enthusiastically welcomed the global challenge represented by the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  which were adopted in 2000 and reaffirmed in the 2005 World Summit Outcome Document (resolution 60/1). We are pleased to report that  through its policy of free primary education and health care for children under five years and women in childbirth  Burundi is achieving successes that deserve support. While thanking those countries and peoples who have been of such great help to us since the launch of the policy in 2005  we would like to call for international solidarity  because the policy requires considerable Government resources that our country cannot acquire on its own.   Indeed  the World Solidarity Fund for the promotion of social and human development and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS  Tuberculosis and Malaria do exist  but unfortunately  despite those initiatives the results are still modest. We therefore appeal to developed countries that have not yet done so to keep their promise to allocate 0.7 per cent of gross national income to official development assistance.   Special attention should be given to problems including putting order into the international financial markets  the need to increase investment in Africa  the rational management of water and energy resources  technology transfer  international trade agreements  climate change and the management of toxic waste.  It is more urgent than ever to harmonize the procedures and instruments for achieving our common objectives  including efforts to counteract hunger  reduce poverty worldwide and to ensure peacebuilding. Otherwise  we will witness the persistence of phenomena including the tragedy of clandestine emigration  the brain drain  heightened crime and other ills.   In closing  I wish to say that we hope that a minimum of political will and strengthened international solidarity will enable the United Nations to find appropriate solutions to the scourges affecting our era. Long live international solidarity. Long live the United Nations. "
"13",509,"BEL",63,2008,"Belgium echoes the congratulations that have been extended to Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session  and wishes him every success.  During the past year  the international community has faced unprecedented challenges. As we gather here in New York  a major crisis of confidence is shaking the financial markets. This has an impact  of course  on the world economy. The spectre of a global recession has been added to the already onerous challenges that have arisen in recent times  such as the food crisis  the  A/63/PV.13 15 08-53122  spike in energy prices  global warming  terrorism and the danger of nuclear proliferation.  In addition  our world is changing and becoming increasingly multipolar. In that regard  8 August 2008 will remain symbolic: the very day on which China offered us the unique spectacle of the opening of the Olympic Games  Russia and Georgia were colliding in a conflict with harmful repercussions for peace on the European continent. The very foundations of the balance that had existed since the 1990s seemed to be called into question. This uncertain situation has far-reaching consequences for international organizations.  We could imagine that  in the face of these enormous challenges  all the world’s countries would come together to combat them jointly. Unfortunately  that is hardly what is happening. Belgium believes that only through close cooperation and enhanced multilateralism will we be able to respond to these challenges. More than ever  whether we like it or not  we are in a situation of mutual dependence. Crises affect all of us  and the actions taken by some have an impact on everybody else. That is particularly true for the current serious financial crisis. If we can stabilize the financial markets in the coming few days through proactive measures  that will benefit not only the major banks and their employees  but also the entrepreneurs  consumers and citizens of the whole world  including those in the least developed countries. Those countries have already been heavily affected by the sharp increase in the prices of agricultural and energy products and are the least equipped to deal with a tightening of credit conditions.   Stabilizing the markets is certainly necessary  but it must not make us lose sight of the lessons to be learned from the crisis and the corresponding medium- and long-term measures to be taken to ensure that the world does not again become victim to financial management that at times is risky and immense speculation with borrowed money.   We are well aware that the crisis goes far beyond the capacity of a single country  however powerful it may be. Better regulation of financial markets and the drawing up of control regulations are essential  in particular with regard to short selling  hedge funds and structured products. That is a task that can be undertaken only at the international level  in close cooperation among the world’s economies.  Understand what I am saying: Belgium is convinced of the advantages of globalization and free trade. We must not forget that thanks to that globalization of trade  in recent decades the world has seen remarkable development and that hundreds of millions of men and women have escaped extreme poverty and today have a better daily life  even if the sharing of wealth still remains too unequal.  The developed countries have the duty to spearhead a better organization of the financial world. The European Union has already taken steps in that direction  and we welcome that. However  there remains much to do. Here  I make an appeal that we embark on that task together  with energy and dedication.  The emergence of new economies is an asset for the world. Ever more countries are determined to become players in the international system. They must take their due place  as the French President emphasized last Monday on behalf of the European Union (see A/63/PV.5). It is also in everyone’s interest to demonstrate responsibility.  I would like to stress today that the emerging economic Powers  from Brazil to India and from China to South Africa  have  more than we do and more than ever  a need for trade that is both open and fair to continue to develop their economies at the pace they deserve  without however causing imbalance in the pillars of international trade. Here too  we must again find the constructive political will necessary to restart the Doha trade negotiations that unfortunately failed in Geneva last July.  We all must also show ourselves to be responsible players  in order to try and find solutions to the challenges posed by the food crisis and the huge increase in energy prices and to combat the causes and effects of climate change. Those challenges we face  issues that are extremely complex and closely interlinked  are different facets of one and the same question  a question that is at the heart of the concerns of my country: that of sustainable development. None of us can resolve these problems alone. They call for solutions at the world level. It is thus crucial that we successfully conclude in December 2009 the negotiations for a global agreement on climate  as we pledged in Bali.   Nor is it by closing in upon ourselves that we shall reduce the huge inequalities that still characterize A/63/PV.13   08-53122 16  global development. Better distribution of the fruits of economic growth is a world responsibility that concerns us all. The Millennium Development Goals must remain our main guiding principle. The Follow-up International Conference on Financing for Development to Review the Implementation of the Monterrey Consensus  which will take place in Doha at the end of this year  will be an important moment. The developed countries must do more  and I reiterate Belgium’s determination to achieve the objective of devoting 0.7 per cent of its gross domestic product to official development assistance by 2010.   However  this is a shared responsibility  which first and foremost falls to the Governments of the countries involved. That is why Belgium will continue to work actively in promoting the concept of good governance.  In that regard  the issue of natural resources is particularly important to me. It is not a matter of calling into question the sovereignty of any country. But sovereignty also carries with it responsibilities — indeed  responsibilities first and foremost. Natural resources may be a driving force of development to draw populations out of poverty if their exploitation is undertaken in a transparent way to benefit the economy of the country. Unfortunately  experience shows that frequently that is not the case and that illegal exploitation often fuels conflict. Therefore  we must work towards achieving greater transparency and fighting illegal exploitation. That is why Belgium organized last year a debate on that subject in the Security Council (see S/PV.5705)  and why it would like extensive debate on natural resources during the current session of the General Assembly.  As a member of the Security Council  Belgium has had the opportunity to be at the heart of the international system. That has bolstered our conviction that we can meet those great challenges only through increased international cooperation and has further strengthened our determination to work for effective multilateralism. The key to that effectiveness is not to be sought only in structures and mechanisms. It lies also and above all in our political will to make them work and together to find solutions to our common problems.  Here  I note with regret a certain turning inwards  even a return to sovereignty-based concerns. I want to be clear: I have great respect for the sovereignty of States. That goes without saying. That is one of the fundamental principles upon which our international system is founded. However  being a sovereign State also means that a State must shoulder its responsibilities in the international community  even more so with regard to its own population. Being a sovereign State does not mean that it can neglect the needs of its citizens in terms of development  security  the rule of law and human rights. Sovereignty does not give carte blanche for conduct that is incompatible with the values and commitments to which we have subscribed within the United Nations. Sovereignty must be a force for good  and not an excuse for a State not to meet its responsibilities and to avoid its international and humanitarian obligations. Otherwise  it becomes what I would call souverainism: an abuse of sovereignty behind which to hide and escape its duties.  Too often the argument of respect for sovereignty prevents the international community from acting when the situation in a country is deteriorating before our eyes  resulting in the population suffering and an increase in serious human rights violations. The examples are well known and strike us all. Myanmar  Darfur  Zimbabwe and the eastern Congo all confront us with a responsibility to protect  a responsibility that the international community is called upon to exercise when a sovereign State cannot or  worse  refuses to assume that responsibility. That can be undertaken through humanitarian instruments  the civil administration of crises  peacekeeping or peace-restoration missions  or  earlier on  crisis prevention.  In that context  I wish to speak of combating impunity. Belgium is convinced that there cannot be lasting peace without justice. That principle guides our foreign policy. It is achieved in the first place by bolstering the rule of law and justice at the national level before  during and after a conflict. For the gravest crimes  we actively support the development of international criminal law. This is not the time to let any doubts persist with regard to our active support for the International Criminal Court by putting forward  as some do  other  more regional solutions. That is particularly true now when the Court is preparing its first trial.  Peace and security are the responsibility of the international community as a whole  and it is in that spirit that Belgium approached its mandate in the Security Council  nearly two years ago: seek constantly  in a constructive and non-dogmatic manner   A/63/PV.13 17 08-53122  the best way to move things forward. It is particularly pleased with the progress in crisis management and the extraordinary expansion of peacekeeping operations. From that perspective Belgium calls for a renewal of the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo with a strengthened mandate  which is a key factor in maintaining in the eastern Congo the prospects for settling the crisis and avoiding a Somalian scenario.   Belgium also welcomes efforts of regional organizations and their collaboration with the United Nations. I am thinking  for instance  of the European Union alongside the United Nations in Chad and the Central African Republic.   We need to make further progress with regard to an integrated and comprehensive approach to conflict resolution. The establishment of the Peacebuilding Commission is a real step forward in that area. That is why Belgium has assumed the chair of the country-specific configuration on the Central African Republic. Major progress has been made  but much remains to be done  in particular in order to better help countries during that delicate phase when they are emerging from crisis.  We will soon celebrate the sixtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. That will be the time for us to remember the values that it represents and that we all share  and to which we all subscribed and which we should implement for the benefit of our citizens and for greater well-being throughout the world. It is a responsibility that we must remember  particularly since it seems to be called into question at a time when we are faced with the major challenges that I have just described. Together and on the basis of our shared values  we should assume those responsibilities.  That is the real challenge. It is not through less  but more international cooperation and multilateralism that we will achieve solutions. "
"14",554,"BEN",63,2008,"I warmly congratulate the President on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session. Benin  my country  will make its modest contribution to the work of this session and will strive to promote the ideals of the Charter  to which my country here reaffirms its full commitment. His predecessor strove to find ideal solutions to the great challenges facing humankind during his mandate. We pay tribute to him for his good and faithful service to the international community.  I also wish to commend the diligent and resolute efforts of the Secretary-General  who has understood the scope of the grave crises that have shaken the world over the past year. Thanks to his bold initiatives to promote international cooperation  he has been able to revive the virtue of multilateralism as the best way to manage world affairs in an inclusive and participatory framework highlighting the uniqueness of our world and the shared responsibility of the human species to maintain the fundamental equilibriums on which its survival on the Earth and the permanence of the biosphere depend.   In 2007  responding to the alarm raised by the scientific community  we focused our attention on    08-51606 36  climate change as a global problem affecting the environment on our planet  with far-from-rosy prospects for the future of humankind and obvious consequences in our daily lives. The two major crises that we have been attempting to contain for several months are unfolding against that backdrop. The energy and food crises  both of which are on our agenda  are two of the world’s most serious crises in recent history. They mark a departure from our previous certainty as regards uninterrupted and lasting supplies of energy and food for our peoples.   The Secretary-General has demonstrated outstanding leadership by sounding the alarm and warning us of the risks of hasty and non-viable responses that could lead to panic and serve to exacerbate the situation. The Rome Conference organized under the aegis of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations made it possible to undertake a comprehensive assessment of the complexity of the crisis and to develop an outline for a comprehensive strategy. That strategy includes immediate steps to address the emergency  as well as several cohesive measures in the short  medium and long term to preserve peace and stability in vulnerable developing States. Those are the countries most affected by the food crisis  which undermines their efforts to combat poverty and hunger.  The response to the food crisis emergency should not lead us to lose sight of the timetable for the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. The international community has a duty to mobilize the necessary resources to correct the serious distortions that are at the heart of the food crisis. Our performance in that regard could be improved if vulnerable countries were able to make the investments necessary to relaunch agricultural production throughout the world in a sustainable manner.   In addition  there is a need to maintain sustained growth rates that can produce prosperity and sustainable human development in the long term. We must continue to work to achieve the Millennium Development Goals and make them a lasting reality.   In this emergency  the United Nations should bring to bear all its influence in order to help countries experiencing difficulties ensure the survival of threatened and vulnerable segments of the population  who risk being decimated by hunger and famine if no one comes to their aid.   The time has therefore come to give concrete expression to the right to food. It is intolerable that hunger continues to be a scourge afflicting humankind in the twenty-first century. In the short term  priority should be given to strengthening social protection systems in least developed countries. Our efforts should make it possible to activate the dormant potential of local productive capacity in order to stimulate small and medium-sized businesses. Problems must be addressed through an integrated approach that makes it possible to maximize agricultural production  as well as of preserving  bringing to market and distributing food crops in order to improve the living conditions of the most vulnerable groups of the population  whose welfare we must effectively ensure. In the medium and long terms  we must rethink agricultural investment policies in order to re-establish the balance between cash crops and food production  so as to ensure food security for States while taking cultural specificities into consideration.  Overall  this crisis illustrates that humankind is not well equipped to manage the consequences of the unfolding emergency. This proves that we are not doing enough for the future and that we run the risk of being subject to all sorts of ills. It is for that reason that the proposal made by the High-Level Task Force on the Global Food Security Crisis for an increase in the proportion of official development assistance allocated to agriculture from 3 to 10 per cent constitutes a strategic approach that should be implemented with common political will commensurate with the stakes involved. I would like to pay tribute to the countries that have already made firm commitments to provide additional resources in that regard.   Benin is being seriously affected by the food crisis  but we are resolutely committed to undertaking the necessary reforms. To that end  in 2006  my Government launched a national agricultural modernization programme in order to address heightened distortions. To date  agriculture in Benin has been characterized by small-scale family farms and based on the use of outdated equipment. In order to change that situation  which has confined food production to subsistence farming  a year ago my Government initiated a mechanization programme to improve the competitiveness of the agricultural sector.   Given that that mechanization alone cannot bring about the expected results without the marshalling of water resources  we are considering a programme for   37 08-51606  rational water management to better utilize that resource while preserving it for the future. The goal is to promote irrigation agriculture  primarily by building irrigation dams in valleys in the north of our country as part of an overall development plan.   Soil degradation  coastal erosion and the combined effects of frequent flooding due to climate change that seriously affect all of West Africa are among the underlying factors contributing to the drop in local food production. In that connection  I should like to express our great appreciation for the awareness-raising efforts of the secretariat for the Convention to Combat Desertification.   Financing mechanisms  including the World Bank’s Adaptation Fund  must function with a heightened sense of the urgent need for aid to affected regions. They should promote the implementation of soil regeneration projects  irrigation agriculture and reforestation with species that will increase the availability of basic foodstuffs.  As part of efforts to promote diversification in the agriculture sector  my Government also intends to encourage the cultivation of crops suitable for biofuels on marginally arable lands. The goal is to reduce dependence on hydrocarbons  which has become more acute following the dramatic drop in the generating capacity of hydropower plants as a result of climate change  whose impact has seriously affected economic activity in my country over the past two years. These difficulties have been exacerbated by the dizzying rise in oil prices.  The tax cuts and import subsidies to which my country has resorted in order to protect the buying power of taxpayers have had a negative impact on public finances. Those stop-gap measures are simply not sustainable in the long-run.   This year we are commemorating the sixtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Benin initiated resolution 62/171  which the General Assembly adopted to proclaim the International Year of Human Rights Learning  which will begin on 10 December 2008. My country proposed that new approach in order to once again place the human person at the very centre of sustainable human development efforts. Human rights learning leads to increased demands for human rights  which society is supposed to provide. It is the duty of the international community to guarantee them. We call upon all Member States to give real effect to the International Year  in line with their national specificities  as well as to take all the steps they believe necessary to promote ownership and the effective enjoyment of human rights by all individuals on their territory.  The activities that will take place during the International Year of Human Rights Learning will provide additional impetus to the efforts we have undertaken to ensure that all citizens subscribe to the Millennium Development Goals  especially in Africa  where the risk of not meeting the Goals by the established deadline is the greatest.  We welcome the recommendations of the Steering Group for achieving the MDGs in Africa. Benin is honoured to be one of the 10 pilot countries chosen. Benin has begun to integrate the concept of “united in action” within the framework of its cooperation with the United Nations system and eagerly awaits its inclusion in the second group of test countries for the implementation of the recommendations of the High-level Panel on System-wide Coherence. This will enable us to develop synergies to accelerate the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.   At the national level  we have integrated the achievement of the MDGs into our national development strategies  which are based on attaining those Goals as part of a sustainable development process focused on and sustained by our nation and aimed at supporting economic growth  which will enable us to achieve lasting success.  We welcome the ongoing consideration of ways to enhance the effectiveness of development assistance  and we hope that this will enable us to develop a consensus vision on the best possible way to revitalize the global partnership for development  with the ultimate objective  in our view  of reducing the scandalous inequalities which still afflict humankind.  It is clear that democratization of the United Nations and the promotion of the rule of law at an international level are endeavours which will contribute to the effective and efficient participation of all peoples in managing world affairs  for the benefit of present and succeeding generations. The promotion of the rule of law at the international level requires the increased representation of developing States in the decision-making bodies of the international financial institutions  as well as a redefinition of their    08-51606 38  institutional mandates to ensure that better use is made of them to mobilize resources for the development of the least developed countries  while preserving the stability of the international financial system.  The democratization of the United Nations also includes the long-awaited reform of the Security Council. As a hostage of the inherent contradictions of today’s international relations  it has remained hopelessly stuck  even though it is recognized as being of cardinal importance to the effectiveness of the Organization. The negotiations to that end should be carried out with a heightened sense of responsibility. We must ensure equitable representation of Member States within the Security Council. I reiterate here the legitimate demands of Africa  as expressed in the Ezulwini Consensus  within the framework of reform aimed at ensuring transparency  legitimacy and increased effectiveness of the Council’s decisions as it discharges its primary role in maintaining international peace and security. The democratization of the United Nations also means a firmer commitment by Member States to respect international and national legality.  In conclusion  I wish to make an urgent appeal to all parties to the armed conflicts that continue in various hotspots throughout the world  whether they be in the Middle East  Asia  Latin America or Africa  to choose the path of peace and dialogue and to respect democratic values.

"15",600,"BFA",63,2008,"I would like to warmly congratulate Mr. d’Escoto Brockmann  on his election to preside over our debates and to assure him of the full support of Burkina Faso. I would also like to express to his predecessor  Mr. Kerim  all my appreciation for the skill with which he guided the work of the sixty-second session.   It is also my pleasure to pay well-deserved tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  who is investing his efforts with foresight and dedication to ensure the success of the reform of our Organization in order to build a safer world and to ensure continuing progress. I would like to reiterate in particular our warm thanks to him for the visit he made to our country last April.  This session of the General Assembly is taking place at the midpoint in the timetable for attaining the Millennium Development Goals and in an international context marked by threats to global peace. The food and energy crises have been joined by a financial crisis of exceptional seriousness. This session is therefore crucial and provides us with a great opportunity to assess the measures that have been taken and to take the necessary corrective measures.   In that respect  I welcome the initiative to organize a high-level meeting on the midterm review of the Millennium Development Goals. The   31 08-51749  conclusions of that meeting  I firmly believe  will help us to establish appropriate strategies to speed up the achievement of the Goals.   The current food crisis throughout the world has amply demonstrated the ineffectiveness of our agricultural policies and the fragility of our production and trading systems. It is urgent to improve how international institutions function  to relaunch investment in agriculture and to support farmers’ and professional organizations in innovative partnerships. To that end  it is important that we commit ourselves to major investment in farming  improved organization for producers  greater control of water resources  more effective distribution of seeds and fertilizers  and simpler access to land.  The energy crisis helps us to prioritize our search for lasting solutions in favour of renewable resources — solar  nuclear  wind and bioenergy resources — because of the impact of energy-related factors on States’ development strategies.  Official development assistance has decreased in recent years in terms of the level of funding and its effectiveness. Beyond the central and recurring question of the level of official development assistance  there are four other dimensions that I believe are crucial. Those dimensions are  first  ownership of economic policies and support for capacity-building in governance in our States; secondly  harmonizing and simplifying donor procedures; thirdly  the gradual alignment of assistance with national development priorities and programmes; and fourthly  improved coordination between our technical and financial partners on the ground  under the leadership of Governments.   Those are the main requirements with regard to ensuring more effective public aid. I take this opportunity to express my thanks to all our development partners who have always supported us as we strive for encouraging results.  The scourge of drugs and narcotics is a threat to Africa in general and the West African subregion in particular. Used as departure and transit points for exporting illegal drugs  some parts of our countries are experiencing a genuine cross-border crime wave. The rapid eradication of that scourge requires the solidarity and active support of the international community.  With regard to environmental issues  the international community must invest more if it is to bring appropriate responses to the climate change affecting our planet. Scientific and political ideas must be aimed today at protecting and preserving a fully functioning ecosystem for future generations.  Resolving conflicts throughout the world  and particularly on the African continent  represents a major challenge for the community of nations. Burkina Faso  which currently holds the presidency of the Economic Community of West African States and the West African Economic and Monetary Union is making its contribution to enhancing peace and security  which are indispensable to ensuring progress and democracy. In Africa  centres of tension remain  but we can welcome the remarkable progress achieved by numerous mediation efforts in various regions  which have demonstrated the capacity of Africans to resolve their disputes for themselves.  In Darfur  the Security Council’s decision has allowed the deployment of the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation. Burkina Faso  which is taking part in that peacekeeping operation  welcomes the appointment of Mr. Djibril Yipènè Bassolé as the Joint African Union-United Nations Chief Mediator for Darfur. Given the complexity of his mission  I call on the international community to give him its full support and to ensure a rapid resumption of the political dialogue and to strengthen the operational capacities of the hybrid force.  We are also concerned by the erosion of the Somali State and its post-electoral crises. With regard to Western Sahara  we are encouraged by the efforts made by the parties to the conflict  particularly the Kingdom of Morocco  and by the Security Council’s call for a realistic settlement.   The Sahelo-Saharan region has been affected by persistent insecurity for many years. Collective efforts at dialogue and cooperation are required to restore peace and security there. In that regard  we welcome and support the Algiers accord reached recently between the Government of Mali and the Tuareg rebels.   Burkina Faso also welcomes the progress made in the Middle East. The strengthening of Lebanese sovereignty  the creation of a viable Palestinian State and security guarantees for Israel will contribute to establishing lasting peace in that region.    08-51749 32   With regard to the Iranian nuclear issue  I hope that reason will prevail and that negotiations will reconcile Iran’s rights to civil nuclear power and the legitimate fears of the international community with regard to military nuclear proliferation.   In Afghanistan and Iraq  the situation continues to be tragic and to claim new victims every day  most of whom are innocent civilians. Burkina Faso will continue to invest with the entire international community in re-establishing peace in those countries.  The news today is dominated by the conflict taking place in the Caucasus. While reasserting its support for negotiations by the European Union  Burkina Faso hopes that the solution to the crisis will be based on inclusive dialogue and respect for international legality.   I note with pleasure an improvement in relations between the Republic of China or Taiwan and the People’s Republic of China. I deeply hope that this new spirit will open the way to Taiwan’s participation in the activities of international organizations.  For many years now  the United Nations has been committed to a process of reforms that should lead to the improved effectiveness of its activities in the face of the demands of the modern world. Despite the progress that has been made  much remains to be done. Our resolve to reach that goal must remain constant.  Burkina Faso has deep faith in multilateralism and solidarity among peoples. We reassert our willingness to make our contribution wherever it is requested to maintain and consolidate peace  development and democracy. "
"16",643,"BGD",63,2008,"Let me begin by congratulating Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann on his well-deserved election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session. I would like to thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his very effective leadership in promoting global peace  security and development.  I take this opportunity to deliver this statement also on behalf of the least developed countries (LDCs). This has been a difficult year for many LDCs  amid rising food prices and a looming economic slowdown. But we have remained resolute in confronting the crisis in a spirit of mutual understanding  support and cooperation  as enshrined in the United Nations Charter.  My statement today will address three interrelated issues: food security  democracy and development. These issues are inextricably linked to one another and are of fundamental importance to the welfare of the citizens of Bangladesh as well as other LDCs.   We have witnessed during the course of this year an extraordinary rise in food and energy prices  which    08-52272 12  has undermined the food security of many least developed economies. This experience should strengthen our resolve to look for long-term solutions leading to a world free of hunger. In the twenty-first century  food security for all citizens in the world must be acknowledged not just as a development imperative  but as a moral imperative. Each and every human life is sacred  and it is our collective duty to provide adequate food and nutrition to people throughout the world.  The recent global rise in food prices has been acutely felt in Bangladesh  even though imports account for a very small percentage of our total cereal consumption. Domestic rice prices spiked by nearly 60 per cent during the year through February 2008  against the backdrop of two devastating floods and a tropical cyclone that destroyed one of our key harvests. For a country like Bangladesh  where roughly 40  per cent of the population lives below the poverty line and where poor households spend as much as 70 per cent of their income on food items  such a steep increase in food prices has had significant adverse effects on food security  poverty alleviation and human development.  Food insecurity can disrupt the core of a democratic polity and derail its development priorities. The cost of food insecurity is measured not only by deprivation  but also by increased instability  which can be very costly for a society. While the free market remains an incomparably powerful tool for the efficient allocation of resources  markets are often imperfect  and no Government can stand idle and hope that the private sector will resolve a food crisis. Making food available to all  and at affordable prices  remains a cardinal responsibility of all Governments. In Bangladesh  we took this responsibility very seriously and delivered rice to our citizens through a public distribution system  in an effort to ensure that no one went to bed hungry.  Soon after assuming office in January 2007  our Government announced a road map for holding a truly democratic and meaningful election. That was no easy task  as decades of corruption had seriously undermined both our democracy and our economy. Corruption’s ill effects corroded our vital public institutions  and the cost was ultimately borne by the ordinary citizens of Bangladesh  who could ill afford it. My Government is determined to ensure that corruption does not imperil the rights of the underprivileged and that  in future  our democracy ensures the good of all Bangladeshis. Our fight against corruption has been the first step in a long and difficult process  and we believe that the work will continue under the auspices of the Independent Anti-Corruption Commission  which was created as an institutional bulwark against corruption. Legal action was initiated against corrupt individuals  but we never compromised due process and judicial independence.  The foundation of a democracy rests on a compact between the State and its citizens. That begins by ensuring that each and every eligible citizen can vote  freely and without fear  and that each and every vote is counted. To that end  my Government has completed the monumental task of electronically registering over 80 million voters with photographs and fingerprints. That was achieved in just 11 months and is a feat that I believe is without precedent anywhere in the world. Our Election Commission trained over 500 000 election workers  deployed over 10 000 laptop computers  webcams and fingerprint scanners and set up over 90 000 registration centres to ensure that every eligible voter could have his or her photograph and fingerprints digitally captured. Multiple layers of safeguards were put in place to ensure that the new voters list was flawless.  In addition to creating a world-class photo voters list  we issued national identity cards to all those who registered. The Election Commission  with the newfound independent authority granted to it by our Government  completed that task in record speed with the support of the Bangladesh army. Our armed services personnel — many of whom have shown their deep and abiding commitment to the ideals of the United Nations through their service in United Nations peacekeeping operations — provided critical logistical support. Their experience  we believe  could be invaluable to supporting and strengthening democracy in post-conflict environments. Our success with the voters list was the result not just of civil-military cooperation  but also international cooperation. We are deeply appreciative of the technical assistance of the United Nations Development Programme for that project and the financial support of our development partners.  An election is only the first pillar of democratic governance. During the past 20 months  my Government has relentlessly worked to shore up democracy’s other pillars. We have made the judiciary   13 08-52272  fully independent. My Government has established the National Human Rights Commission to protect and promote the fundamental rights of all our citizens. We have enacted a right to information law  which will help provide the transparency that is necessary to a well-functioning democracy. We have  in consultation with the political parties  amended and strengthened the Representation of People’s Order  under which forthcoming elections will be held. That law and regulations under it will require the registration of political parties for elections  ensure intra-party democracy and implement campaign finance reforms that will limit the influence of corrupt money in our political system.  Just last month  the Bangladesh Election Commission organized the successful holding of some local and mayoral elections. That marked a new beginning in our electoral process  and our citizens were able to exercise their franchise without undue influence of money or muscle power. The elections were held without disruption and drew an unprecedented number of voters. Let me reiterate here that my Government is fully committed to holding free and fair parliamentary elections on 18 December 2008  as announced last week. We are confident that all political parties will participate in the elections.  Few nations face the challenges that we face in Bangladesh for mere survival. Our development gains  achieved through the work of years and decades  can be wiped out in a matter of hours. One cyclone can push hundreds of thousands of people back below the poverty line. Bangladesh is particularly vulnerable to climate change  given that we are a low-lying delta in one of the highest rainfall regions of the world. There is growing concern that an irreversible climatic shift will displace tens of millions of our people. By some estimates  a one-metre sea-level rise would submerge about one third of the total area of Bangladesh. Given our population and its vulnerabilities  that would result in the greatest humanitarian crisis in history. Inaction is simply no longer an option. It is nothing less than a basic moral imperative that countries that have contributed little to this crisis  such as Bangladesh  not be left alone and unsupported to suffer the most from its consequences.  Adaptation is necessary  but it may not be sufficient to cope with the unavoidable impacts of climate change. Countries like Bangladesh will face the worst consequences in the absence of a legally binding commitment on mitigation. International efforts to minimize emission levels should not  however  disproportionately tax poorer nations. We must have guaranteed access to appropriate mitigation technologies and know-how on affordable terms. We strongly feel that the post-Kyoto agreement should set up a technology transfer board  in order to ensure that the least developed nations have access to affordable  eco-friendly technologies. Bangladesh will not be able to attain sustainable development without appropriate technological support in that regard.  We would not have discussed the food crisis issue here in the Assembly  if we had believed that it was a one-off event. The crisis will revisit us  perhaps with greater intensity and frequency  unless we put in place both short- and long-term measures to prevent its recurrence. Many of us in the developing world were deeply encouraged when the Secretary-General responded to our urgent request for a high-level task force to address the current food crisis. It was also timely and appropriate that the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations convened the High-Level Conference on World Food Security in Rome in June 2008. The Conference afforded us the opportunity to deliberate on systemic and non-systemic issues that exacerbated the current food crisis.  Bangladesh  as representative of the least developed countries  also urged the Secretary-General to look into the possibility of creating a global food bank. We suggested that the food bank could allow countries facing a short-term shortfall in production to borrow food grains on preferential terms. Once they overcame the shortfall  those countries could return the quantum to the food bank. We could also explore the possibility of determining special drawing rights for each country  using criteria such as population  level of poverty and annual variation in their level of food production. Such an arrangement would allow us to prevent hoarding and price gouging by speculators in anticipation of  and during  a food crisis  and we believe that a mechanism can be put in place to guard against any moral hazard issues that might arise.  Since the adoption of the Brussels Programme of Action in 2001  LDCs as a group  have made some progress in their macroeconomic performance and on a few social indicators. The progress is  however  insufficient and uneven. More important  their economic growth has made only a little dent in poverty. LDCs continue to face serious structural hurdles in    08-52272 14  their development efforts. They remain acutely susceptible to external economic shocks and natural and man-made disasters.   The full and effective implementation of the Brussels Programme of Action has now become an even greater necessity. However  it is unlikely that we will achieve the overarching goals of the Programme of Action and the MDGs  unless international commitment to the LDCs in the areas of aid and trade is fully delivered.   The Brussels Programme of Action will conclude in 2010. The General Assembly is in the process of preparing for the fourth United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries  to be held towards the end of the current decade. The upcoming conference will provide an important opportunity for LDCs and their partners to review critically past performance  especially in the areas of failures and weak implementation. That will help us develop a new  action-oriented strategic framework for the next decade to assist the LDCs in their development efforts. I call upon Member States to extend full and effective support for the successful holding of the next United Nations conference on the LDCs.  Bangladesh is in the midst of a profound change that we believe is also relevant to people all around the world  especially to those fighting poverty  corruption and underdevelopment. As with any process of change  it is not without setbacks and will take time to complete  but in the end we remain confident of our success. Our goal is to strengthen democracy in Bangladesh  and my Government has done everything in its power over the course of the past 20 months to work towards that end.  I have spoken about the remarkable achievement with our voters list  which will ensure that the elections this December and every election thereafter can be free and fair; and I have also discussed some of the fundamental institutional reforms that we have undertaken to bolster the foundations of democracy. Many countries around the world are in their own ways going through similar processes  and we hope to share our experiences in order to help them  as we ourselves have benefited from the support of the international community and organizations like the United Nations Development Programme. "
"17",689,"BGR",63,2008,"It is a privilege and an honour to address this distinguished audience on behalf of Bulgaria  particularly as my country is celebrating the centennial anniversary of the proclamation of its independence. Throughout those 100 years  Bulgaria asserted and safeguarded its independence  often through active participation in international organizations  including the United Nations. Having recently become a member of the European Union (EU)  my country is now even more committed to the universal and regulatory role of the United Nations in today’s globalized world. We align ourselves with the statement made by President Sarkozy of the French Republic on behalf of the EU (5th meeting).  Permit me to congratulate you  Sir  on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session. We wish you every success in the months ahead and pledge our full support for your endeavours. Our deep gratitude goes to His Excellency Mr. Srgjan Kerim for his able guidance of the Assembly at its previous session.  Given the growing urgency of food security  the topic that we are discussing today is of crucial importance. We fully support the United Nations-led efforts  reflected in the Rome Declaration  to ensure a timely response to a problem that may have grave consequences for the livelihoods of millions of people.  Food security is a cross-cutting issue that should be considered against the background of other interrelated global challenges  such as climate change and energy security. These also demand an immediate response based on the common but differentiated responsibilities and capabilities of various countries. The United Nations should continue to provide a unique forum for the elaboration of the effective multilateral approach needed.  Next spring  Bulgaria intends to host a summit entitled “Gas for Europe: New Transregional Partnerships and Projects”. It is important to bring together heads of State and Government from all interested countries in South-Eastern Europe  the Black Sea/Caspian Sea region  Central Asia  the EU and the United States in order to encourage political dialogue at the highest level and to enhance transregional cooperation with a view to achieving a balance among energy and other strategic interests.  Effective multilateralism requires an intensive partnership between the United Nations and regional organizations. On the basis of the European Union-United Nations Joint Declaration on Cooperation in Crisis Management  the EU and the United Nations have engaged in partnerships that have already delivered results in many areas related to peacemaking and peacebuilding. A good and pragmatic relationship between the United Nations and NATO in the Western Balkans  Afghanistan and Africa is also of crucial importance.  Various forms of regional  subregional and transborder cooperation may serve as building blocks for a comprehensive collective security system. Peace and stability are well rooted when local communities and immediate neighbours live in harmony. That philosophy guided the recent Bulgarian chairmanship of the South-East European Cooperation Process. Regional cooperation in South-East Europe has recently gained momentum. South-East Europe is in   27 08-52272  the process of changing from an area recovering from war to a thriving and dynamic region. Over the past 12 months  a whole new architecture of interaction has come into being  connecting the countries of the region to the rest of Europe and the international community. In line with the concept of regional ownership  the pivotal role has now been assumed by the new Regional Cooperation Council.  Democracy  security and cooperation still have a way to go in the Black Sea region. More coherent efforts are needed for an ultimate settlement of the protracted conflicts there. Frozen conflicts should not be neglected  because they tend to reignite tension time and again. The recent armed hostilities in South Ossetia and in other parts of Georgia have provided ample evidence to that effect. Bulgaria gave its full support to the peacemaking mission of the French EU presidency and remains actively involved in the preparation of the EU Monitoring Mission. We are convinced that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia should be upheld and that the military contingents should be withdrawn to their positions prior to the conflict in order to allow effective monitoring by the EU and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) of the implementation of the six-point plan.  Bulgaria contributes fully to the Eastern Dimension of the European Neighbourhood Policy  which should address the needs and priorities of all partners in the region. We see opportunities for launching projects in important sectors such as transport  trade  energy  the environment and border security. The EU’s Black Sea Synergy initiative is a pragmatic way to intertwine various regional initiatives  thus multiplying their effect.  As prevention and development are inextricably linked  the Bulgarian Government and the country office of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Bulgaria are currently exploring the potential for a Bulgaria/UNDP regional hub for the Western Balkans and the Black Sea area to share accumulated know-how  training and research.  We condemn terrorism unequivocally and reject terrorist ideology in all its forms and manifestations. The first review of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy held recently proved that the United Nations should continue to play a central role in mobilizing the international community to counter terrorism and all related phenomena  such as radicalization and extremism.  In countering terrorism  it is essential to conduct that struggle within the requirements of international law and to overcome prejudices and stereotype perceptions in a world of great diversity. Bulgaria’s long history of tolerance has been based on the common understanding that cultural diversity is a great asset in our society. It is in that spirit that Bulgaria actively participates in the United Nations Alliance of Civilizations and supports other like-minded initiatives.  This year  we mark the sixtieth anniversary of United Nations peacekeeping operations. As we pay tribute to the six decades of promoting peace and protecting the vulnerable  we should also realize that there is still much to be done. The United Nations is facing a serious challenge due to the complex and multidimensional character of a growing number of peace operations and missions.  Bulgaria continues to make its contribution to the international peacekeeping efforts in the western Balkans  Afghanistan  Iraq and Africa. Our task today is not only to keep the peace; we must also make certain that peace is irreversible and sustainable. The Peacebuilding Commission  an early achievement of the reform process  has now become functional and has achieved some practical results in Burundi and Sierra Leone.  Global celebrations of the sixtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights this year have reaffirmed the critical importance of universal adherence to international human rights standards  the realization of which should make the world better for us all  free of poverty  intolerance and discrimination. Despite the progress achieved  we should never relent in our efforts. The Human Rights Council  with its institution-building process successfully accomplished  should engage in constructive  all-inclusive work aimed at promoting and guaranteeing all human rights for all.  Stable peace and security can be achieved only through development. Therefore  there is an urgent need to accelerate the implementation of the internationally agreed development goals  including the Millennium Development Goals. We are convinced that the responsibility for the timely achievement of    08-52272 28  those Goals lies with both developed and developing countries.  Solidarity with those in need  and in particular with the developing countries  is an important and irrevocable principle of Bulgarian foreign policy. We are taking our first steps in building a new donor capacity and shall strive to achieve the targeted levels of official development assistance as part of the European Union development cooperation policy.  In order to perform its role in the world efficiently  the United Nations must follow persistently the course of reforms initiated at the 2005 World Summit. We welcome the progress achieved during the sixty-second session of the General Assembly towards improving the working modalities of the main United Nations bodies. Bulgaria expects that the remaining tasks on the United Nations reform agenda will be pursued vigorously and without delay during the current session.  In that regard  we welcome the efforts of the Secretary-General and his determination expressed in his opening statement. It is in our common interest to ensure that this sixty-third session of the General Assembly achieve tangible results. That is what the peoples of our countries  the people of the world  are expecting of us. "
"18",734,"BHR",63,2008,"May I  at the outset  convey my heartfelt congratulations to you  Sir  on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session and assure you of the commitment of the Kingdom of Bahrain and its delegation to working closely with you towards achieving our shared objectives. I have no doubt that your experience and abilities will play a crucial role in ensuring the success of this session. I also want to take this opportunity to thank your predecessor  Mr. Srgjan Kerim  for his leadership of the General Assembly at its previous session and to express our continued and deep appreciation to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his ongoing  unflinching dedication and initiative in addressing the many challenges facing the United Nations and the world.  These General Assembly meetings provide a valuable opportunity for all of us in the international community to reflect on the challenges  problems and issues facing us all in order to form a more comprehensive view of the issues  to understand their causes  be it through success or failure  and to work together to develop a shared vision of the future and the tools necessary to achieve our aims and realize our vision.  Today  the international community faces many challenges in achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  notably those related to energy  the environment  natural disasters  food shortages  education and the financial crisis that has recently shaken the world. These challenges make achieving the MDGs difficult for many States  to a degree that affects their economic development and increases the rate of poverty in them. We therefore need an urgent and effective response from the international community to deal with those pressing issues in order to achieve the MDGs. Yet  as we review our progress to date  the global effort to achieve the Goals has been uneven  at best  to the point that we are today on the verge of a development emergency. A/63/PV.13   08-53122 26   The Kingdom of Bahrain welcomes the opportunities provided by the high-level event on the MDGs  held on 25 September  and the high-level meeting on Africa’s development needs  held on 22 September  to renew the commitments of all States.  In addressing these important issues  we must not lose sight of the impact of disasters  both natural and man-made  in holding back progress towards achieving the MDGs. It is thus imperative that States integrate disaster risk reduction into their development plans. We simply cannot afford to ignore or delay these development issues. Nor can we dismiss them as soft issues  for if action is not taken soon  they will become real threats to global security and prosperity. The Kingdom of Bahrain therefore fully supports the Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction and plans to host the launch of the report in May 2009.  As we all know  the issue of climate change is of utmost importance. As the world prepares to meet to negotiate a successor to the Kyoto Protocol by the end of 2009  global demand for energy is rising fast  as populations increase and some developing countries undergo dramatic economic growth. The International Energy Agency predicts that the world’s energy needs could increase by 50 per cent by 2030. We therefore look forward to the meeting to be held in Poland later this year in advance of the United Nations Climate Change Conference to be held in Copenhagen in 2009. We are hopeful that all sides will realize the importance of the climate change issue and will commit themselves to addressing the overriding interests of the future of our planet and of future generations. Our hope is that a comprehensive and effective agreement can be concluded and implemented.  The peaceful use of nuclear energy has become a preferred option for many countries  and here the Kingdom of Bahrain therefore shares the concerns of the international community. Therefore  future agreements on the use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes must be made within a strengthened  non-proliferation regime  with improved safeguards and an expanded verification mechanism  in order to ensure that our peoples are not put at risk. Indeed  a highlight of the twenty-eighth Supreme Council of the Gulf Cooperation Council  held last December in Doha  was the acknowledgment of the right of countries of the region to seek nuclear expertise and to possess nuclear energy for peaceful purposes  in close cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency.  Given its universal impact and implications  energy and its various sources are in need of a holistic  global approach  yet they are dealt with in a fragmented  piecemeal manner. That unsatisfactory situation leads us to suggest the establishment of a truly comprehensive energy organization. Such an organization would bring a joint international perspective to determining the role and usage of hydrocarbons  nuclear power  new and renewable energy sources  and would introduce innovative solutions to reduce pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Such a body could provide accurate assessments of global energy demand and supply and bring energy data under one roof. It would also provide any objective advice that might be required on an optimal energy mix that is both safe and environmentally sound.  Having spoken of energy and climate change issues  I must now turn to the food security crisis  which is a result of high food prices and which in 2007 increased the number of hungry people in the world by about 50 million. We believe that the solution to that crisis lies in working together to implement solutions  such as reducing biofuel production  changing consumption habits and investing in sustainable agricultural methods.  The shock that has recently affected the international financial system has almost resulted in a global economic catastrophe. That shock has revealed the weaknesses and fragility of the current financial system and its propensity for rapid and widespread dislocation. We bear the historic responsibility to establish transparent new regulations based on the interests of all States Members of the United Nations and to prepare a framework that can contain any future financial crisis.  The fact is that multilateral cooperation is fundamental to addressing these challenges  as no country alone can resolve such issues and crises or isolate itself from their consequences. As the Secretary-General said in his opening statement  (spoke in English) “Nations can no longer protect their interests or advance the well-being of their peoples without  A/63/PV.13 27 08-53122  the partnership of other nations.” (A/63/PV.5  p. 1). (spoke in Arabic)  The Kingdom of Bahrain therefore supports efforts to reform  renew and reinvigorate the international Organization and its organs to be more responsive to the needs of a new world. We agree with the view of the Secretary-General  set out in his annual report (A/63/1)  that we need a stronger  more effective and more modern Organization. We look forward to the structural reform of this international Organization to enable it respond more effectively to the challenges faced by the international community and to increase its capacity to deal with such issues.  We must make every effort to address such shortcomings as threats to the international security system emanating from a wide range of external sources  including extremists  terrorists  drug traffickers  money launderers and intellectual property pirates. We need to develop collective security arrangements that bring together our security efforts while ensuring respect for existing borders between States and avoiding encroachment on their sovereignty.   On the issue of terrorism  we consider terrorism to have many faces — whether in the form of the heinous crime perpetrated in Islamabad a few days ago that led to the deaths of scores of innocent people  or agitation and incitement from afar or a variety of other manifestations. We should be clear and decisive in confronting terrorism in a comprehensive manner so as to defeat it both in the field and ideologically. We believe that the struggle against terrorism is a battle that we should wage  united  if we are to get rid of its evil.  The Middle East faces many acute issues in desperate need of settlement  the most pressing of which is the need for a just  comprehensive  lasting and peaceful settlement of the Palestinian question based on ensuring security for all the peoples of the Middle East region  including Israel. Such a settlement must take place within the framework of international legitimacy and the relevant terms of reference  where the choice will be just peace  as called for in the Arab Peace Initiative.   In that regard  there is also an urgent need for a peaceful settlement on the Syrian track  including withdrawal from the occupied Arab Syrian Golan and the remaining Lebanese territories. It also requires a halt to Israeli incursions into Lebanon  whose stability must be supported. It is also important to have a resolution of the issue of the occupied islands of the United Arab Emirates  either through direct negotiations or by referring the issue to the International Court of Justice. That would be a significant step towards strengthening trust between the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council and Iran.   The Gulf region  which is an integral part of the world economy  has experienced destructive wars during the past three decades. It will not be able to endure a new war  due to the severe consequences on the world economy. The Kingdom of Bahrain therefore reiterates its call for a peaceful solution to the Iranian nuclear issue  in order to avoid the scourge of war in the region and to enhance world peace and stability.   Moreover  there is an urgent need to rid the Middle East and the Gulf region of weapons of mass destruction  including nuclear weapons  while safeguarding the rights of all countries to the peaceful uses of nuclear energy in accordance with the comprehensive safeguards regime of the International Atomic Energy Agency.  In order for the Middle East to enjoy stable and lasting peace  it is incumbent upon us to re-evaluate our outlook on the region and to consider the possibility of developing new regional frameworks to address and overcome long-standing challenges. Now is the time  for example  to consider the establishment of an organization that would include all States of the Middle East  without exception  to discuss long-standing issues openly and frankly  in the hope of reaching a stable and durable understanding between all parties. As Arabs  we accept peace as a strategic option. We are committed to international legitimacy  ending old conflicts and hostilities and beginning a new chapter for a historic rapprochement between the peoples of the region that will lead towards a better future characterized by understanding  stability and prosperity.  Developments in the Kingdom of Bahrain in recent years have been characterized by dialogue and understanding  a process inaugurated by our leader  His Majesty King Hamad bin Isa Al-Khalifa  as part of his extensive reform programme that aims at strengthening democracy  political reform and the promotion and protection of human rights. At a time when we will A/63/PV.13   08-53122 28  soon join the United Nations and the international community in commemorating the sixtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  which laid down the principles and values of freedom and human justice for modern times  Bahrain’s election to the Human Rights Council and the adoption at Geneva in June of the report on our first universal periodic review serve to clearly illustrate the international community’s recognition of Bahrain’s efforts in the area of human rights.  The Kingdom of Bahrain will continue to move forward in that and other fields  for example  by establishing Bahrain’s national human rights institution and continuing to make progress in the political  economic and regulatory spheres. The Kingdom of Bahrain will not hesitate to play its role in helping brotherly and friendly States and in sharing its success stories  which have helped provide a better life for our people. In that regard  His Highness Shaikh Khalifa bin Salman Al-Khalifa  Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Bahrain  in cooperation with the United Nations Human Settlements Programme  has sponsored an award called the Shaikh Khalifa bin Salman Al-Khalifa Habitat Award  which honours distinguished research that contributes to alleviating poverty and safeguarding the environment and recognizes the efforts of States to achieve desired economic development. His Highness is expected to present the award this year during the fourth session of the World Urban Forum  which is to be held in Nanjing  in the People’s Republic of China.  A key pillar of Bahrain’s approach to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) continues to be its investment in modern education that is practical  relevant and of high quality and that instils critical thinking and creativity and encourages innovation and acceptance of the other. In that respect  I want to note that Bahrain has been able to achieve the Millennium Development Goals in the area of education significantly before the 2015 deadline. We have done so by providing children with free high-quality education and by making basic education for all a fundamental human right.  In conclusion  the Kingdom of Bahrain  the “land of immortality” and proud host of many civilizations  is a country where the concepts of tolerance and coexistence among all segments of society are central. Mosques stand alongside churches and temples of various denominations  and people enjoy freedom and religious tolerance irrespective of their religion or ethnicity. Fraternal values  moderation and the rejection of violence and terrorism are embedded in our culture  auguring a promising new era in the history of humankind.   That is the Kingdom of Bahrain that is committed to participating fully  along with the rest of the international community  in achieving global peace  stability and prosperity and to confronting current and future challenges  for the benefit of our peoples and future generations. That is a task the international community must undertake in a spirit of cooperation and good faith  for when future generations evaluate our actions and hold us to account  they will not forgive our mistakes and miscalculations. "
"19",772,"BHS",63,2008,"On behalf of the Government and people of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas  I congratulate you  Sir  on your assumption of the presidency of the Assembly at its sixty-third session  and I assure you of the full support and cooperation of my delegation. I should also like to take this opportunity to commend Mr. Kerim on his stewardship of the Assembly at its sixty-second session  which has just concluded.  The Bahamas commends the Secretary-General for this opportunity to assess our global commitment. We first committed ourselves to the creation of a society for all in 1995. Five years later  we recommitted ourselves to that objective and signed on to the development agenda  a noble objective. We are now at the halfway point  and we must judge for ourselves whether the progress made has been good enough. We believe that efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and ultimately create a society for all must be carried out in tandem with steps to achieve full employment and decent work for all.  The implementation of the MDGs is simply the implementation of my Government’s philosophy and programmes. It is with considerable satisfaction  therefore  that I am able to report that the Bahamas has achieved many of the MDG targets and indicators. Over a two-year period  assistance to the poor in the Bahamas and to low-income families is being increased by 45 per cent.  The issue of international migration and development is of particular concern to the Bahamas. We have been burdened for some 60 years now with irregular and unauthorized migration  which places increased demands upon the education  health and social services of the Bahamas. It also represents potential national security threats  particularly as organized crime networks have become increasingly involved in the cross-border smuggling of illicit drugs  firearms and human cargoes. Therefore  the Bahamas looks forward to the discussion scheduled to take place during this session on the follow-up to the 2006 High-level Dialogue on International Migration and Development.  New and emerging problems continue to slow global development  and the current food  energy and financial crises threaten to erode the gains made over the past 10 years towards ending poverty  hunger and malnutrition and reducing deaths. Apart from the consequential increase in production costs for all consumer goods  the growing cost of energy is affecting the travel plans of many  with direct negative consequences for tourism  the primary industry of the Bahamas.  Of equal concern is the persistent challenge of climate change  especially for small island developing States such as the Bahamas  where 80 per cent of our landmass is within 1.5 metres of sea level. It is no surprise to find the Bahamas listed among the 100 countries most vulnerable to the consequences of climate change and sea-level rise. Potential impacts of further rises in temperature include not only the environmental degradation of marine and terrestrial ecosystems — loss of biodiversity and compromised    08-52272 32  groundwater tables  agricultural lands and fishery resources — but also the social and economic losses that might be expected from labour displacement.   My Government has recorded its commitment to preserve our marine and terrestrial environments and to meet the targets established by the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity for 2010 and 2012. Indeed  we fully expect to exceed our commitment to conserve at least 20 per cent of the near-shore marine resources across the Bahamas by 2020. That reality informs the Bahamas’ desire for urgent action on climate change.   The increasing number and fury of tropical storms and hurricanes passing through the Caribbean are  I believe  yet another indication of the negative effects of global climate change. This year alone  those tropical storms and hurricanes have had a devastating effect on a number of countries in our subregion  including the island of Inagua in the southern Bahamas  Cuba  Jamaica  the Dominican Republic  the Turks and Caicos Islands and Haiti. They pose a singularly peculiar threat to our countries  as they are capable  literally in one fell swoop  of wiping out all the development gains we have achieved over many years of hard work.   That is especially true for Haiti  where conditions are especially grim. The Bahamas is pleased that the United Nations has remained actively engaged in Haiti. The Bahamas commends the work of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti. As the current Chair of the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Response Agency  I am pleased that the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) has been able to contribute to the relief efforts in Haiti  but Haiti’s needs remain at proportions that can be addressed only by the international community. We are heartened by the flash appeal for Haiti under the auspices of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.  The current global economic climate presents a formidable challenge to both developed and developing countries. The Bahamas has established a comparative and competitive advantage in a number of international service industries by laying a solid foundation based upon the rule of law  with its attendant protection of private property rights  combined with sound macroeconomic policies and a commitment to democratic ideals that foster an enduring political stability.  Our participation in the international economic  financial and trading systems has permitted us to embrace opportunities presented by globalization and to achieve reasonable levels of growth and development. Nevertheless  we remain vulnerable to the challenges posed by our size and the limits on our representation in global governance.  The Bahamas supports the strengthening of the United Nations Committee of Experts on International Cooperation in Tax Matters and its upgrade to an intergovernmental body. It is the view of the Bahamas that international tax matters  including issues of importance to developing countries that are not adequately addressed in other organizations  should be discussed in an open  transparent and inclusive forum. For that and other important reasons the Bahamas calls for the convening of a major international conference to review the international financial and monetary architecture and global economic governance structures. The case of small developing countries must be addressed in the context of international systems that are fair  equitable  objective  open and inclusive. Therefore  effective permanent representation of developing countries  particularly small developing countries  is needed in the international economic  trade and financial institutions  including the Bretton Woods institutions and the World Trade Organization  as well as other bodies  such as the Financial Stability Forum.  The Bahamas reaffirms its support for the intergovernmental negotiations on Security Council reform with a view to expanding the membership of that body in both the permanent and non-permanent categories  as well as improving its working methods. International peace and security is important to us all. The Bahamas fully supported the General Assembly’s adoption of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy in September 2006 as a framework for collective action to prevent and combat terrorism.  The Bahamas condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations  and we call for  and commit to  the full implementation of a culture of peace  justice and human development and respect for all religions and cultures. I am pleased to report my Government’s ratification  since taking office last year  of the United Nations Convention against Corruption  the International Convention on the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings and the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime — the Palermo   33 08-52272  Convention — and its Protocols. The Bahamas commends the Secretary-General’s initiative in organizing the first-ever United Nations Symposium on Supporting Victims of Terrorism.  Escalating acts of crime and violence  civil unrest  wars and internal conflicts around the world continue to threaten our efforts to create a just and peaceful international environment. The 2008 World Drug Report indicates that the supply of illicit drugs is increasing. That has serious consequences for our subregion. The Bahamas and members of CARICOM are neither significant producers nor suppliers of narcotics. We are neither manufacturers nor suppliers of small arms and light weapons. Yet the meteoric rise in the illicit trafficking in drugs  small arms and light weapons  illegal migration and human trafficking through our subregion creates a formidable challenge to the national security and socio-economic growth and development of our countries. Therefore  the Bahamas reiterates the call made by CARICOM last July for the illicit brokering in small arms and light weapons to be addressed in a holistic  transparent and legally binding manner  with renewed commitments for effective and enhanced safeguards.  We are poised to mark  on 10 December  one of the greatest achievements of this great Organization: the sixtieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The Bahamas reaffirms its commitment to the fundamental principles of human rights  dignity and freedom for all. The Bahamas commends the entering into force of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the adoption of the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearances and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.  For more than six decades  human rights  poverty and development and peace and security have attracted the attention of this Assembly. The complexity of those issues  coupled with a lack of good governance and political sensitivity  has too often impeded meaningful advances. As we celebrate the Declaration’s sixtieth anniversary  I recall the vision of a former First Lady of the United States of America  Eleanor Roosevelt  as expressed in her address on 8 March 1960:  “We are going to have to work for a peaceful world continuously  without stopping because differences exist among people. They exist in families  they exist within nations and they will exist in the world. And therefore  without any question you are going to have to work to achieve peace in the world much more continuously than you have ever worked.” That is as true today as it was 48 years ago."
"20",797,"BIH",63,2008,"It is an honour to address the General Assembly at its sixty-third session.  Allow me to express my gratitude to Mr. Srgjan Kerim  who ably presided over the Assembly during the preceding year  and to congratulate you  Father Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann  the new President of the General Assembly. I also thank you  Sir  for an inspiring appeal for respect for basic  universal ethical values.  The first time I stood at this rostrum was in May 1992  as the Foreign Minister of a newly independent Bosnia and Herzegovina. At that time  I recounted the unspeakable atrocities that were unfolding in my country. I also warned that  if not stopped  such atrocities would only get worse. In fact  I merely asked that Bosnia and Herzegovina be accorded the right to defend itself  the right guaranteed by the Charter.  We know what has happened since. Some in the international community insisted on maintaining the arms embargo imposed by the Security Council in 1991  thus adding to the obviously overwhelming military advantage of Milosevic’s regime  which was bent on destroying Bosnia and Herzegovina and its people. They justified this course by claiming that lifting the arms embargo meant adding oil to the fire. The result was that the fire was quelled with the blood of the innocent.  According to International Committee of the Red Cross data  200 000 people — 12 000 of them children — were killed  up to 50 000 women were raped  and 2.2 million people were forced to flee their homes. This was a veritable genocide and sociocide. The intent of the perpetrators of this genocide was to forever destroy the unique multi-ethnic fabric of Bosnia and Herzegovina through mass slaughter  rape  torture  abuse  expulsion and plunder. In spite of this  defenders of our country conducted themselves honourably  as demonstrated by the acquittal by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia of most of Bosnia and Herzegovina’s military leadership.  All this culminated in Srebrenica in July 1995. The International Court of Justice — the court of this Organization — ruled in its Judgment of 26 February 2007 that “the Bosnian Serbs devised and implemented a plan to execute as many as possible of the military aged Bosnian Muslim men present in the enclave” (para. 292) and that  “the acts committed at Srebrenica ... were committed with the specific intent to destroy in    08-51606 4  part the group of the Muslims of Bosnia and Herzegovina as such; and accordingly … these were acts of genocide  committed by members of the [Army of Republika Srpska] in and around Srebrenica from about 13 July 1995.” (para. 297)  Through its acts and omissions  the United Nations  by its own admission  bears part of the responsibility for the crimes committed at Srebrenica. In fact  the Secretary-General’s 1999 report on Srebrenica unequivocally states:  “Through error  misjudgement and an inability to recognize the scope of the evil confronting us  we failed to do our part to help save the people of Srebrenica from the Serb campaign of mass murder ... Srebrenica crystallized a truth understood only too late by the United Nations and the world at large: that Bosnia was as much a moral cause as a military conflict. The tragedy of Srebrenica will haunt our history forever.” (A/54/549  para. 503)  We do not want the United Nations to be haunted. This Organization’s credibility is too important to the world to carry the burden of this failure. Errors can be committed  but errors must not be repeated. We want the United Nations to right the wrongs. In fact  international law mandates that this must be done. The International Law Commission’s articles on State responsibility for internationally wrongful acts  adopted in resolution 56/83 of 12 December 2001  mandate that “No State shall recognize as lawful a situation created by a serious breach [of a peremptory norm of general international law]”  which clearly includes the crime of genocide and crimes against humanity  “nor render aid or assistance in maintaining that situation” (article 41).  If those principles had been applied  would the institutions identified by the International Court of Justice as perpetrators of genocide still exist? Would vast portions of a country remain ethnically clean? Would over a million refugees and displaced persons remain outside their homes? In short  do these principles allow for the arrest of Karadzic and the simultaneous preservation of the results of his project? In fact  just today The Hague Tribunal announced a revised indictment against Karadzic that charges him with genocide and crimes against humanity  against both Bosnians and Croats in 27 municipalities in Bosnia and Herzegovina. This process will further implicate the Milosevic regime in the planning and commission of those crimes.   We cannot bring back the dead  but we can give dignity and justice to the survivors. What we say today is aimed not at the past  but at the future  and not only for Bosnia and Herzegovina. We owe it to not only the victims and survivors  but humanity as a whole. The message to the would-be perpetrators of crimes in the name of a twisted ideology should be crystal-clear: do not even think about it; your terror will not pay off. That should be the message.  In Bosnia and Herzegovina  we had the opportunity to make that true by a consistent implementation of the 1995 Dayton Peace Agreement  which ended the aggression  stopped the genocide  and brought peace. These were its major accomplishments  and their value cannot be overemphasized.  The Dayton Peace Agreement  however  was also intended to reverse the effects of genocide and ethnic cleansing. It had all the necessary elements to do so. Instead  in the words of the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina  its main provisions have been a victim of:   “a systemic  continuing and deliberate practice of the public authorities of Republika Srpska with the goal of preventing the so-called minority returns  either through direct participation in violent incidents or through the abdication of responsibility to protect the people from ... violent attacks due solely to their ethnic background”.  Dayton never intended such ethnic apartheid to take root in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is not the implementation of the Dayton Peace Agreement  but the violation of its core principles  that led to this result. It would be a grave mistake to recognize this result as lawful and legitimate. It is the responsibility of this Organization to make it right. Just as we should not have been forced to smuggle arms into our own country to defend ourselves  we should not be forced now to smuggle basic human rights  justice and democracy into Bosnia and Herzegovina.  Without righting this wrong can we genuinely celebrate the sixtieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights this December? Moreover  can we celebrate the sixtieth anniversary of the adoption of the Convention on the   5 08-51606  Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide if the first and only Judgment of the International Court of Justice on the crime of genocide remains in the Court’s archives?  Now is the time to right these wrongs. We are about to start work on the new Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina  and the outcome of that process will answer many of these questions.  To those who now seek to legitimize the systemic violations of the Dayton Peace Agreement  we all must say: make no mistake  genocide will not be rewarded. That is the responsibility of this Organization. Rewarding genocide would send a dangerous message throughout the world  and would surely undermine the chances of peace and stability in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the region.   Seekers of justice are not the enemies of peace. They are the guardians of peace. As the Secretary-General said today  justice is the pillar of peace and stability. That is what this statement is all about. Certainly  there are those in Bosnia and Herzegovina who would not agree  but they are surely not the victims of genocide.  We have not forgotten the help we received from many of the countries represented here today  a number of whose soldiers  diplomats  aid workers and journalists died in Bosnia and Herzegovina while working to end the aggression  bring peace and ease the suffering  or to make sure that the rest of the world knew about it. For that we thank them once again  and renew our sympathy to their families.   An even greater number of countries have assisted us in rebuilding our society after the aggression  and we extend our heartfelt gratitude for that as well. Bosnia and Herzegovina still needs help in this regard  and we hope that we can work together in order to ensure permanent peace and stability in my country  the region and the world. "
"21",844,"BLR",63,2008,"This session’s general political debate and high-level meetings once again convince us of the need to move in international relations from confrontation based on narrow national interests towards equal  mutually respectful dialogue and cooperation. Otherwise  it will not be possible to achieve progress in addressing the urgent global and regional problems facing humanity.  The advent of the twenty-first century raised many hopes  but thus far the world has not been able to avoid wars as a means of achieving its objectives. Imposing or dictating one’s will and pressure by individual States increase conflict and make it difficult to overcome obstacles. Today  we are dealing with global challenges that not only impede humankind’s development but also threaten our civilized existence. This situation imposes special responsibilities on all stakeholders in international relations  irrespective of their geographical location  their geopolitical influence or their socio-political systems. Equality  non-confrontation  mutual respect and proper dialogue: those are the keys to overcoming the obstacles to effective progress on development.  Over recent years  we have often spoken of the need to increase the effectiveness of the work of the General Assembly and its influence on overall global processes. That can be achieved only if each State that seeks to make its own modest but positive contribution to addressing global problems can be sure that its approaches and proposals will be closely and impartially studied in the General Assembly.  In the eight years since the Millennium Summit  we have seen that the Millennium Development Goals  on which the fate of millions of individuals depends  will continue to be mere words on paper if the more developed States do not cease to view efforts to establish the conditions conducive to development in countries in the South and to provide those countries with financial and economic support from the perspective of their own geopolitical interests. Let us just admit honestly that the global partnership for development that is mentioned so often in this Assembly still does not exist in practice.  Unless we deal with the energy and food crises  we will not achieve any progress. We must work in the interests of all and not serve the wishes of a narrow group of influential countries. We also need to clearly determine how we will target our efforts and act in a systematic way.  The challenges we are facing are interrelated: climate change and energy and food shortages  to a large extent  are due to existing patterns of energy use. Humankind has an increasing impact on the atmosphere and the biosphere; environmental problems due to the increasing impact of human activity lead to climate change; climate change  in turn  leads to reduced agricultural harvests; and that  in turn  exacerbates the food crisis.  Thus  we are faced with a single  multidimensional global challenge  and the value of this session will be magnified if at this international forum we hear new  justified and forward-thinking proposals for a coordinated response to the challenges facing humankind. Such an approach should undergird the work on a post-Kyoto agreement  and today it is   31 08-53141  clear that talks on that accord must include a broader range of issues than simply agreement on quantities and quotas for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  Belarus has stated on many occasions that future approaches to the problem of how to ensure economic growth while not harming the environment will be based on international cooperation to spread throughout the world energy-saving technology and technology for the use of alternative and renewable sources of energy.  An intrinsic  fundamental and vital element of that cooperation should be ensuring fair access by all States to such technology by establishing  through the United Nations  a global mechanism to control the process. The first step in that direction has been defined and can be adopted in the very near future: their Tehran ministerial meeting  on the initiative of Belarus the non-aligned States proposed holding at the sixty-third session of the General Assembly a thematic debate on ensuring access for all States to energy-efficient technology and the use of alternative and renewable sources of energy — naturally with due respect for intellectual property rights.  Particular attention must be paid to establishing a multidimensional energy agenda at the United Nations  which should take into account the interests of producer  transit and user countries. Responsible energy cooperation can be a key factor in regional security. Turkmenistan’s proposal to discuss ways to ensure reliable transit for fuel is also promising.  In the context of establishing a fair system of international economic relations  particular attention must be paid to a code of conduct for transnational corporations in exploiting oil and gas fields and the mineral resources of developing countries. We need reliable protection against the practice of international oil cartels of finding concessions that are profitable to them  but that amount to slavery for the host country. Such deals are often challenged  but the oil companies use the media to justify their measures  citing threats to regional security. We look forward to the discussion of that important initiative and those issues during this session of the General Assembly.  Indeed  attempts to get access to resources are the basic cause of many current conflicts. Here  we are talking not only about oil and other energy resources: people are also dying because of local conflicts linked to the lack of drinking water. Given the fact that 97 per cent of global water resources are found in the oceans and seas  finding practical ways to desalinate seawater should be a priority for scientific research in the coming decades.  The United Nations can play a role in defining the future of such technology  and we believe that this should belong to all mankind. To ensure that  we must put in place mechanisms to avoid the concentration of such technologies in the hands of a chosen few. One of the main keys to successfully addressing global problems facing mankind is speedily achieving agreements and understandings among the whole international community. Any delay in addressing climate change is unacceptable  because it affects other issues on the international agenda.  We believe that one of the main concerns on that agenda should be human development and the prevention of exploitation of nations and individuals. A United Nations action plan to fight human trafficking is an important stage in efforts to counter contemporary forms of slavery. Within the United Nations  work on that plan is under way: we have set up an inter-agency coordination group; resolutions have been adopted by the General Assembly and by the Economic and Social Council; and we have held thematic debates in the General Assembly. We call on all delegations to take an active and constructive role in that process  which will raise the issue of human trafficking to a new level. An inadequate response to the threat will promote the exploitation of entire nations and establish a new chain of human trafficking  and the number of new slaves will increase. Criminals will begin to select the best from among their victims  and  as a result  there will be growth in colonialist thinking in the new framework of globalization  which would render the problem particularly dangerous. We do not have the right to allow such a situation to develop.  From its very beginning  the United Nations was seen by its founding States as the most democratic of international institutions  a universal mechanism for involving all countries and peoples in establishing a new and just world order. As a founding Member of the United Nations  Belarus supports the initiative of the President of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session  Mr. d’Escoto Brockmann  to give particular attention to the democratization of the Organization. We support that process within the United Nations  and we support allowing all Member States equal    08-53141 32  opportunities and the same rules of the game. We favour strict respect for all the principles set out in the United Nations Charter.  The results-oriented proposal for democratization includes enlarging the membership of the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation. Over the 20 years since the accident at Chernobyl  Belarus has acquired unique experience in studying the effects of radiation on individuals and the environment  and we would like to have the opportunity to share that experience with other States within the framework of the Scientific Committee. We call on all States to support the admission of Belarus as a member of the Committee  which was established on the recommendation of the First Committee  adopted as resolution 913 (X)  entitled “Effects of atomic radiation”.  We also support efforts to democratize the Secretariat. The management of each Secretariat department should respect the principle of equitable geographic representation. The top five jobs in each department should be distributed among the five regional groups. Establishing that principle will be an important step forward in creating confidence among Member States.  We hope that we are moving towards several important international events. In Doha  there will be an international conference on financing for development. Work is continuing on a post-Kyoto accord  and discussions on the reform of the Security Council are entering a new phase. Their success depends on us all. Will we be able to have a constructive dialogue and a non-confrontational approach and reach a deeper understanding of the real interests of all peoples throughout the world than we have today? Most answers to those key issues of the contemporary world are to be found in our own history. All we need to do is look back at our own history and draw the right lessons from the past in a timely way. "
"22",879,"BLZ",63,2008,"On behalf of the Government and people of Belize  I congratulate you  Mr. President  on your assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session. It is a distinct honour for all Central American and Caribbean peoples. I assure you of Belize’s fullest support during your term of office.  I would also wish to thank your predecessor  Srgjan Kerim  for the sterling manner in which he presided over the sixty-second session. I also wish to pay tribute to our very capable Secretary-General  who works so assiduously to discharge the multifaceted responsibilities of the United Nations.  Belize accepts with pride and humility the invitation so kindly extended to us to share our vision of how we should address the great challenges of the day and how we can achieve the unity we need in order to do so effectively.  Being a very small State in a world that has long been characterized by greed  indifference  arrogance  apathy  selfishness and myopia  Belize is no stranger to crises. In our evolution from colonialism to independence  we have had far more than our fair share of them and we survived them all.  Thus  while we join in the consensus  so forcefully articulated over the past week  that never has there been a time in the recorded history of humankind that the world has been beset at one and the same time by so many crises of potentially catastrophic proportions as it is today  we remain convinced that the solution to those crises is not beyond the collective wisdom of humankind. On the contrary  we are convinced that our world leaders  who gathered within these hallowed walls this past week  possess the moral  intellectual and financial capacities to overcome the present challenges and to secure the future of our planet Earth and of all who dwell upon it. We therefore look to the future with optimism.  My Government believes that there are a number of preconditions that must be satisfied before we can hope to successfully combat the challenges we face. The first is the acceptance by all peoples that we are our brothers’ keeper and that  as you  Sir  so poignantly stated  “either we treat each other as brothers and sisters or we witness the beginning of the end of our human species” (  p. 5).  The second and equally important precondition is the acceptance by all peoples that we are heirs to and owners of the Earth and of all the resources thereon and that no individual race or nation has a greater claim to them than anyone else. And the third and perhaps most important precondition of all is the acceptance by all peoples that our planet as we know it is not indestructible  that it can be mortally damaged  if not destroyed  by what we do to it  and that none of us would escape the consequences of such a tragic turn of events.  The experience of our own country  Belize  bears out the fact that the treatment we mete out to each other determines to a large extent our own destinies. The hardships and deprivations which Belizeans suffered in the past and continue to suffer even today have been caused in large part not by nature dealing us a bad hand but by the human exploitation and   7 08-53141  selfishness of which we are the victims. Nature itself has been bountiful to us — so much so that our national poet  Samuel Haynes  who penned the lyrics of our national anthem  was moved to begin one of the stanzas with the following line  “Nature has blessed us with wealth untold”.  Yet with all our abundant natural resources  it is very doubtful whether we will  despite our best efforts  be able to achieve the Millennium Development Goals by the year 2015. We are not in a position to say today with any degree of certainty that by 2015 all the children in our country  boys and girls alike  will complete publicly funded primary education. Nor can we forecast that by 2015 we will attain gender equality  reduce childhood mortality by two thirds and maternal mortality by three quarters  and reverse the spread of HIV/AIDS and other diseases.  The truth is that small countries like ours are not the masters of our own destinies. We are severely constrained in what we can do to advance our own development agendas because we simply do not possess and cannot readily access the human  financial or technological resources needed to develop our people and to secure our futures. And given the predatory nature of the world we live in today  we will never be able to attain those resources using our own devices. We will most certainly need the assistance of the international community. We live in an interdependent world.  While the developed countries may possess all the human  financial and technological resources we lack  the crises which now confront us are making it manifest that not even the richest and most powerful of them can successfully withstand and combat the catastrophic consequences of nature’s fury and man’s excesses by relying on their own devices and resources. They must join forces with the rest of the world. That imperative was articulated by Mr. Gordon Brown  Prime Minister of the United Kingdom  on 26 September in this very Hall (see ) when he stated  in essence  that every global problem requires global solutions  that we cannot solve the food crisis  climate change and the pressures on resources without involving Africa and the developing countries  and that Africa and the developing countries are not the problem but part of the very solution to today’s problems.  What Gordon Brown speaks to and what many of the leaders in this general debate have highlighted is the global leadership challenge we face. In addressing that challenge  we would propose that we first examine how our multilateral institutions function. Joseph Stiglitz in his book Making Globalization Work wrote that:  “The nation-state  which has been the center of political and ... economic power for the past century and a half is being squeezed today — on one side by the forces of global economics  and on the other side by political demands for devolution of power. Globalization — the closer integration of the countries of the world — has resulted in the need for more collective action  for people and countries to act together to solve their common problems.” Stiglitz continued that  “while the nation-state has been weakened  there has yet to be created at the international level the kinds of democratic global institutions that can deal effectively with the problems globalization has created.”  There is no disputing that the interests of the developing countries are poorly represented and dealt with in the present global institutions. That is clearly manifested in the multilateral trade and financial institutions  where negotiations are closeted in green rooms and where the fundamental democratic principle of one vote per country is subverted in a system that determines voting rights based on economic power. If the developing countries are to become developed  it will be imperative to revisit those structures and transform them into institutions that are representative  transparent and democratic.  In addition to the systemic issues that must be addressed  we must also tackle the crisis of implementation. If we consider the numerous conferences and summits that have been convened to craft global responses to development  sustainable development  financing for development  trade  climate change and more recently the food crisis  there is no want of commitments and common objectives.  The Millennium Development Goals promised to the world’s peoples that we would take concerted action to improve the quality of their lives. The Monterrey Consensus promised a new global    08-53141 8  partnership that would support those efforts to eradicate poverty and promote sustainable economic growth and development. The Doha Ministerial Declaration promised to put the needs and interests of the developing countries at the heart of its work programme.  But we know from the reports that our progress towards the realization of the MDGs has been slow and uneven that the realization of the Monterrey commitments has been dismal particularly on the part of developed countries and the international financial and trade institutions  and that the Doha Development Round has collapsed. Indeed  were these commitments not set down on paper  one might question their very existence.  We also know that the failure of the full implementation of our global commitments is not for want of resources but for want of compassion and empathy. Globalization may have forced the world into a closer relationship  but at the political level it has not managed to calibrate national interests vis-à-vis global interests. We therefore still act only when it is in our narrow self-interest to do so.  However  the current crises are signalling clearly that we can no longer subsume the global interests under our own. The challenges we face clearly demonstrate how our fates are intertwined. As leaders  we must start now  with a sense of urgency  to take the necessary action to deliver on the promises of development. More importantly  we must commit to submitting our actions to international oversight.  The United Nations must play the pivotal role in addressing the global leadership crisis. Belize holds the view that the way forward is for the United Nations to concentrate its efforts on convincing the leaders and peoples of the developed world that the security  development and well-being of all peoples of the world afford the best guarantee for their own security  safety and development and ultimately their very survival. It is our conviction that the adoption of that view by the developed world would prove to be the catalyst for achieving the unity that the world now needs to be able to address successfully the challenges of our day.  To that end  the United Nations must be strengthened so as better to serve to monitor the implementation of the globally agreed commitments. Its universality must be reinforced with the participation of all relevant stakeholders in its elaboration of responses to our threats and challenges. In that regard  my Government wholeheartedly supports the participation of the Republic of China on Taiwan in the United Nations specialized agencies. Finally  its decisions must carry the full weight that impels action.  The United Nations still represents the great hope for all our peoples. The principles upon which it was founded and the objectives for which it was formed are no less relevant today than they were in 1945. For my own country  our membership in the United Nations secured the hope of peace  security and development  even as we continue to struggle with a long-extant claim to our territory. It provides the framework within which we can peacefully settle our differences. Today  the Governments of Belize and Guatemala have an opportunity finally to settle that dispute by juridical means  specifically through referral to the International Court of Justice (ICJ). We have reached a major stepping stone  but we are not deluded by the challenges ahead. Not only must we negotiate a compromise for the referral of the matter  but the question of taking the claim to the ICJ must be put to national referendums in both countries. The road to the ICJ and the final resolution of the territorial difference will undoubtedly have many high tolls. Belize appeals to the international community through the United Nations for its continued solidarity and support.  Sixty years ago when we adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  humanity had been wrested from the throes of war. The Declaration confirmed in article 1 that  “All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.” The global conscience was awakened and alerted  because our forebears knew that continued disregard and contempt for human rights and freedoms would lead to barbarous acts between peoples and nations. They foresaw the advent of a world in which human beings would enjoy freedom of speech and belief and freedom from fear and want  and proclaimed those freedoms as the highest aspirations of the common people.  My Government holds an unflinching commitment to those values and aspirations. We are still soldiers in the battle for freedom  equality and   9 08-53141  justice  but in fighting that battle we no longer need the crude instruments of war. Instead  we have as our weapon the power of the rule of law  cooperation and friendship between peoples and nations and an abiding faith in multilateralism. Let us be so guided. "
"23",926,"BOL",63,2008,"This meeting of the United Nations is being held at a time when there is a rebellion of peoples throughout the world  a rebellion against poverty and destitution and against the effects of climate change  against the privatization policies that have caused the financial crisis.    08-51606 30   I wish to tell the Assembly that in Bolivia in recent years we have experienced great uprisings by our people  social movements from the countryside to the cities  of indigenous workers and farmers questioning economic models and systems that simply privatized natural resources and steadily sacked the country. The privatization of basic services and the policies imposed by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) did not solve anything for the majority of Bolivians. I came to the presidency in 2005 and 2006 as a result of that struggle by the social movements  which was accompanied by an ongoing labour and social struggle by our Bolivian comrades and brothers who were seeking equality and social justice.   With a little experience I can say that in the two and a half years of my Government we have nationalized the natural resources  such as oil and gas  and the economy is beginning to change profoundly. In 2005  before I was elected President  the Bolivian State received only $300 million for its oil and gas resources. Last year  2007  after nationalization and after we changed the hydrocarbons law  the Bolivian State received $1.93 billion. Being a small country with about 10 million inhabitants  that enabled us to improve the national economy. The recovery of our natural resources is so important that that has been the goal of a historic fight by our peoples.   I wish to speak about some results with regard to social issues and about some profound changes in democracy that took place with the participation of the workers in various social sectors. However — and I am certain that in the last few days the world has been able to grasp this — there is an ongoing conspiracy of small groups against this process of change. I want it known that since the first day of my Government some conservative parties that favour imperialism have consistently tried to weaken us and to wear us down. Last year they requested a referendum to recall the President. I accepted that calmly  and instead of my being recalled  some prefects and some opposition authorities were recalled by the Bolivian people. I received the support of 67 per cent of the people in the recall referendum of 10 August 2008.   I should like to recall something important that our forefathers used to say — our leaders who fought for control of our land  people such as Tupac Catari. In 1741 we were cut into pieces by the Spanish invasion. Before Bolivia was founded and before dying  our leader said  “I die  but I will return transformed into millions of people”. For the first time a President of the Bolivians has received more than 2 million votes. So the statement of Tupac Catari  the leader of our ancestors  has come true. But that was part of a process of change in the democracy  with the awareness of the Bolivian people.   After 13  14 and 15 August  that small group of conservatives began to organize a coup d’état of municipal authorities and prefects against the Government and the State. I will quickly list some of those events. On 14 and 15 August there was a meeting of a so-called national coordinating committee of the right  which attempted to prevent the national authorities from reaching four regions of the country. They attacked the departmental command of the national police  and there was an attack on the police subcommander. A roadblock was set up in four regions to cut off food supplies for the population. Oil installations were surrounded. There was a general attack on institutions  and in four departments 75 government offices were taken over. The State radio and television were silenced  especially the community radios. The airports were taken by those groups.  I remember that  when I was a boy  in the military dictatorships the coups d’état began with takeovers of the State television stations. History is repeating itself  but thanks to the conscience of the Bolivian people this civil coup in Bolivia has been defeated. Thanks to the participation of the nations that have now come together in the Union of South American Nations  this attempted civil coup d’état has been defeated.  Here  I would like to say something. Surely  some participants are waiting for me to tell them why we expelled the United States ambassador. Europe and Latin America repudiated the attempted civilian coup  but the Government of the United States did not  nor has it denounced those acts of terrorism. This morning I heard the statement of the President of the United States condemning terrorism. In Bolivia  right wing groups are setting fire to gas pipelines and cutting off the valves for the export of gas to Brazil and Argentina  but the embassy of the Government of the United States does not condemn such acts of terrorism.   It is not hard to imagine that  if some social movement were to steal his country’s national wealth  the United States ambassador would condemn  denounce and repudiate such an act. I would like to   31 08-51606  hear the representatives of the United States Government denounce these acts of terrorism. Of course  the terrorists know that the United States is their ally. It is never going to condemn them. The ambassador of the United States was clearly the primary human element conspiring against the United States Government. I remember perfectly the year 2002  when I was a parliamentarian. On the instructions of the United States embassy  I was expelled from Parliament. I was accused of drug trafficking and of being an assassin. In 2002  the United States created a governance programme through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to finance the strengthening of the conservative political parties and put the brakes on a growing political liberation movement  a political movement for the sovereignty of our peoples  a political movement that was designed to bring an end to injustice and to seek equality for Bolivians.   I also remember — some participants may not recall it clearly — that in 2002  when I was called for the first time to be a candidate for the presidency  the United States ambassador said: “Do not vote for Evo Morales. If you vote for Evo Morales  there will be no international aid or international cooperation”  thereby instilling fear in the Bolivian people. And they did not stop there. They also said: “Evo Morales is the Andean Bin Laden  and these farmers are the Taliban”. Hence  standing before this Assembly is an Andean Bin Laden who represents the Taliban  which is the indigenous farmers’ movement that historically fought for its claims.  There are so many accusations of that kind. When we came to power  we found a CIA office in the Government palace. After we discovered it  we had no problem getting rid of it because we had no need for a CIA office in the palace. Obviously  they were operating from there. For example  in 2004  they wanted to force the National Congress to give diplomatic immunity to civilians or members of the Bolivian military. We rejected that  of course  thanks to our social cohesion. In 2005  they began dismantling the military’s missiles  together with some commands and  of course  the administration in place at that time.   Dismantling the military is treason; it is not possible that the Southern Command of the United States armed forces would practice such a policy. However  they continuously tried to control some members of the military. For example  in previous Governments  they created a special counter-terrorism force  the F-10  and at one point in time their representatives informed me that  in 2005 or 2004  they were prepared to kill labour or political leaders who opposed capitalism and imperialism.   When I appointed a commander  he was vetoed by the United States embassy. Of course  we are not going to allow any more vetoes. Last year  special firearms munitions were illegally brought into the country at the instigation of the commander of the United States military group  Colonel Campbell. We were told that these were missiles for training purposes. Moreover  they illegally employ young students belonging to United States peace groups to carry out spying activities on officials of the Governments of Cuba and Venezuela. They are working in secret against the Government of Bolivia  thus violating the constitutional rights of their own United States citizens who come to Bolivia on scholarships.  I would point out that when one works for equality and for social justice  one is persecuted and conspired against by certain groups. These groups are not concerned about human equality. It is clear that this is a historic fight for our peoples and that it is nothing new. We can speak about the economy  or about the cost of silver as an industrial commodity  but what we are talking about is the fight between rich and poor. It is the fight between socialism and capitalism. That historic struggle is being resumed now  but I feel that these battles are uprisings and rebellions of peoples against an economic model — against the capitalist system. If we do not understand that capitalism is destroying humanity  then I am sure — and I hope that no one will be offended — that we will not solve the problems of life  the problems of the planet or the problems of humanity.   I am not accusing anyone of being an accomplice of capitalism. From a communal and labour struggle to an electoral one  from organizer to President  I have become perfectly aware that capitalism is the worst enemy of humanity. As I said a few days ago  with great sincerity  while touring my country  I was brought up in social movements among workers  farmers and indigenous peoples. More than 500 years ago  our forefathers fought colonialism and imperialism  and that is why I am anti-imperialist today. No one is going to move me from that position. If people like me  they like me a lot  but if they do not    08-51606 32  like me  so be it. What the world is going through is unjust.   So much has been said about climate change  flooding  droughts  how our mountains are losing their snow. If we continue in this way  we will all be responsible for destroying the planet  and thus humankind.   I have heard good statements from other presidents participating in this debate  from which I have learned a great deal; but I am sorry to say that I do not believe that it is enough to simply raise the problems unless we also provide the solutions. I would like to say that some blacklists have been drawn up to punish Governments.   It is difficult to imagine that those terrorists groups are not condemned  while the national Government is decertified for supposedly being involved in drug trafficking. According to United Nations reports  some countries are increasing their coca plantations  but they are not on decertified lists because they are pro-capitalist. To those countries that support the counter-narcotics struggle by reducing their coca cultivation  we did not say that there would be no coca  but that there would be no free cultivation of coca  since the coca leaf does have medicinal and nutritional benefits. Once we clearly defined our anti-imperialist position  we were decertified. However  I am quite sure that this is not about certification or decertification  terrorist or non-terrorist countries.   Mr. Bush  President of the United States  sent me a message recently in which he wrote: “If I am not a friend  I am an enemy”. I do not care whether I am a friend of the President of the United States  but I am a friend of the people of the United States. I have had many meetings with representatives from social movements in the United States and we agree on our approach to life and humankind. That is why we have to put an end to blacklists. We are living in times where there are no empires  no dominance or imposition of economic models that can greatly harm countries or continents or the whole world.   I wish to say that we have begun to work on a proposal. It is called “Ten commandments to save the planet  humankind and all life”. I hope that my colleagues will distribute this document  and with the participation of all it will help us save the planet  humankind and life. One of the first subjects we raise here is how we can put an end to capitalism. Wherever there is capitalism  there is exploitation. Wherever there is capitalism  our natural resources are plundered. That is what we have seen and experienced.  Our second point is that we must denounce war. As everyone knows  we are working arduously to put Bolivia back on track by drafting a new constitution. In that new political constitution for the Bolivian state  for the first time the State and the people of Bolivia will constitutionally pledge never to initiate war. That does not mean that we renounce defending ourselves. I do not believe in wars.  Speaking of war  I am sure that peoples do not want wars. They do not want the military intervention of any country in any part of the world. In our new political constitution for the Bolivian State  we propose that Bolivia should not accept the military base of any country of the world on its territory. In that way  we shall assert our dignity and defend the sovereignty of Bolivia and of other peoples. I have very respectfully suggested to the people and the Government of the United States that it would be best to withdraw their military from Iraq and Afghanistan and other parts of the world as soon as possible. If they do not  the peoples themselves will expel them because interventionism and war are no solution for life and humanity.   Our third point is a proposal for a world without imperialism and colonialism. Last year  I heard a critical issue discussed here by several heads of State. That issue was water — water as a right of all living beings. We also heard discussions on energy and how important it is to have clean  environmentally friendly energy.   Speaking of nature  the indigenous peoples have experience living in harmony with Mother Earth and nature. Mother Earth is neither a shopping centre nor a commodity. Thus  the historic struggle of our peoples is for land and territory  and that struggle is being repeated in our country.   Our next point  as I said earlier  is to Mother Nature within the United Nations. I hope that can be taken into account. I would also note that the new Bolivian political constitution incorporates the ten commandments to save humanity and the world.  Basic services should be human rights. Water  light and telecommunications cannot be in private   33 08-51606  hands. If they are human rights  they should be a public service and not left to the private sector. To be sure  we have many differences with multinationals. Investment is certainly important  but we need investors in Bolivia who are not the owners of our energy and our oil  but who are our partners.   My next point is that we should consume only what we need and prioritize local consumption in the context of food sovereignty. We also need to respect the diversity of cultures and economies.  Our final point concerns how to live well. What does it mean to live well? Living well is living in equality  solidarity and complementarity  eliminating inequalities between families and the deep-rooted disparities that exist among countries and continents. When we try to live better  sometimes all we do is to become selfish and ambitious. We never think about the larger family  which  for us in Bolivia  is the whole of Bolivia.   The struggles of peoples for democracy and for the re-establishment of the rule of law is being repeated in Bolivia. In the past  great social movements led by indigenous farmers brought down dictatorships. In recent days  they defeated an attempted coup in Bolivia  and we hail them. We have just been informed that social movements are wisely mobilizing themselves in a search of peace and asking that new standards be adopted to ensure equality be for all Bolivians.  In conclusion  I wish to say that I am convinced that only the conscience of the people can defeat the interests of certain groups and United States imperialism. I heard some leaders this morning sue for peace with a regulated  moderate form of capitalism. I do not believe in that. There will be peace only when there is equality among all human beings; there will be peace only when our identity and the dignity of every people are respected.  I do not think there can be peace with capitalism  no matter how moderate or regulated. We need to work together  we need to participate in the struggles of our peoples for equality. Only Governments and leaders working together with their peoples can find equality. When we have equality  there will be social peace throughout the world. "
"24",973,"BRA",63,2008,"It is my great pleasure to greet my dear friend Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann  President of the General Assembly. I wish you much success in your mission.  The present session of the General Assembly is being held at a particularly serious time. An often predicted economic and financial crisis is now today’s harsh reality. Because of the responsibility of speculators  entire peoples are suffering anguish in the wake of successive financial disasters that threaten the world’s economy. Indispensable interventions by State authorities have defied market fundamentalists and shown that this is a time for political decisions. Only decisive action by Governments — particularly those of countries at the epicentre of the crisis — will be able to rein in the disorder that has spread through the world’s financial sector  with perverse effects on the daily lives of millions of people. The lack of rules favours adventurers and opportunists  to the detriment of real companies and workers.   The great Brazilian economist Celso Furtado said that we must not always allow speculators’ profits to be privatized while their losses are invariably socialized. We must not allow the burden of the boundless greed of a few to be shouldered by all. The economy is too serious a matter to be left in the hands of speculators. Ethics must also apply to the economy.  A crisis of such magnitude will not be overcome through palliative measures. Mechanisms for both prevention and control are needed to ensure full transparency for international finance. Today’s supranational economic institutions have neither the authority nor the workable instruments that they need to control the anarchy of speculation. We must rebuild them on entirely new foundations.  The global nature of this crisis means that the solutions we adopt must also be global and must be decided upon in legitimate and trusted multilateral forums  without coercion. The United Nations  as the world’s largest multilateral arena  must call for a vigorous response to the weighty threats that we all face.  Yet there are other  equally serious matters facing the world today. One of them is the food crisis  which afflicts more than a billion human beings. The energy crisis is also growing worse every day  as will the risks to world trade if we fail to achieve an agreement at the   7 08-51570  Doha Round; another is the unrestrained degradation of the environment  which lies behind so many natural calamities whose victims are overwhelmingly the poor.  The fall of the Berlin Wall was expected to open up possibilities for building a world of peace  free from the stigmas of the cold war. However  it is sad to see other walls going up so quickly.   Many of those who preach the free circulation of commodities and capital continue to fight the free movement of men and women  using nationalistic and even racist arguments that evoke unpleasant memories and fears of times that we thought were behind us.   A supposedly “populist nationalism”  which some forces seek to identify and criticize in the South  is being unabashedly promoted in the developed countries. The financial  food  energy  environmental and migration crises  to say nothing of threats to peace in several regions of the world  reveal that the multilateral system must be overhauled to meet the challenges of the twenty-first century.  Gradually  countries are moving beyond old conformist alignments with traditional centres. That new attitude  however  does not imply a confrontational stance. Simply by using direct dialogue without intermediation by major powers  developing countries have stepped into new roles in designing a multipolar world  with examples such as India  Brazil and South Africa (IBSA)  the G-20  the summits between South America and Africa and between South America and the Arab countries and the BRIC countries — Brazil  Russian Federation  India and China.  A new political  economic and trade geography is being built in today’s world. While navigators in the past would look to the North Star  today we are trying to find our way by looking at multiple dimensions of our planet. Now we often find our North Star in the South. On my continent  the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) was created last May  as the first treaty — after 200 years of independence — that brings together all South American countries. This new political union will coordinate the region’s countries in terms of infrastructure  energy  social policies  complementary production mechanisms  finance and defence.  Meeting in Santiago  Chile  just over a week ago  the Presidents of South America demonstrated UNASUR’s ability to respond quickly and effectively to complex situations  such as the one in our sister nation  Bolivia. We supported its legitimately-elected Government  its democratic institutions and its territorial integrity and we issued a call for dialogue as a path to peace and prosperity for the people of Bolivia.  Next December  in the state of Bahia  Brazil will host the first summit of all of the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean on integration and development. This will be a high-level meeting under no umbrella  based on Latin America’s and the Caribbean’s own perspectives. All these efforts in the multilateral sphere are complemented by my country’s solidarity initiatives with poorer nations  particularly in Africa.  I also wish to emphasize our commitment to Haiti  where we command troops of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti and are helping to restore peace. I reiterate my appeal for the solidarity of developed countries with Haiti  since implementation has fallen far short of the many promises.  The strength of values must prevail over the value of strength. Only legitimate and effective instruments can assure collective security. The United Nations has spent 15 years discussing the reform of its Security Council. Today’s structure has been frozen for six decades and does not match the challenges of today’s world. Its distorted form of representation stands between us and the multilateral world to which we aspire. Therefore  I am much encouraged by the General Assembly’s decision to launch negotiations in the near future on the reform of the Security Council.  It is multilateralism that must also guide us toward solutions to the complex problems of global warming  based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. Brazil has not shirked its responsibilities. Our energy matrix is increasingly clean. Today’s food and energy crises are deeply intertwined. The inflation of food prices is affected not only by climatic factors and speculation in agricultural commodities; it is also driven by rising oil prices which affect the prices of fertilizers and transportation. Attempts to tie high food prices to the distribution of biofuels do not stand up to an objective analysis of reality.  Brazil’s experience demonstrates — and this could be the case for countries similar to ours — that    08-51570 8  sugar-cane ethanol and biodiesel production reduce our dependency on fossil fuels  create jobs  regenerate degraded land and are fully compatible with expanding food production. We wish to intensify all aspects of that discussion at the world conference on energy and biofuels which we will be holding in November 2008  in the city of Sao Paulo.  My obsession with the hunger problem explains my ongoing efforts  along with other world leaders  to reach a positive conclusion to the Doha Round. We are still pushing for an agreement to reduce scandalous farm subsidies in rich countries. A successful Doha Round will have a very positive impact on food production  particularly in developing and poor countries.  Four years ago  along with several world leaders  I launched the Action Against Hunger and Poverty here in New York. Our proposal  then and now  is to adopt innovative funding mechanisms. The International Drug Purchase Facility is one early result of that initiative  helping to fight AIDS  tuberculosis and malaria in several African countries. But it is not enough. We still have a long way to go if we want humanity to actually achieve the Millennium Development Goals.  In December 2008  we will commemorate the sixtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  paying a tribute that will go far beyond mere formalities. That document expresses inalienable commitments that challenge us all. As Governments  we must do more than support the Declaration with rhetoric. We are called upon to fight for the values proclaimed six decades ago and to make them a reality in each country and around the world.  Today’s Brazil is very different from what it was in 2003  when I became President of my country and stood for the first time before the General Assembly. Our Government and society have taken decisive steps to transform the lives of Brazilians  creating nearly 10 million formal jobs  distributing income and wealth  improving public services  lifting 9 million people out of extreme poverty  and bringing another 20 million into the middle class. All this has occurred in an environment of strong growth  economic stability  lower external vulnerability and  above all  a stronger democracy with the intense participation of our people.  In the year when we commemorate the one-hundredth birthday of the great Brazilian Josué de Castro — the first Director-General of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and a pioneer in the studies concerning the problem of hunger in the world — it is worthwhile to reread his warning: “It is no longer possible to sit back and let a region go hungry without the entire world suffering the consequences.”  I am proud to state that Brazil is overcoming hunger and poverty. I reiterate the optimism that I expressed here five years ago. We are much greater than the crises that threaten us. We have the heart  the right-mindedness and the will to overcome any adversity. More than ever  that is the spirit of Brazilians. "
"25",1017,"BRB",63,2008,"It is with great pleasure that I associate the delegation of Barbados with previous speakers who have congratulated the President on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session. We are particularly proud to see a fellow member of the Latin American and Caribbean group assume that high office  and I pledge to him the full support of the Barbadian delegation as he carries out his most important mandate. We wish also to commend his predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Kerim  for leading the Assembly over the past year through complex discussions on a range of global challenges.   I also extend the good wishes of the Barbadian Government to the Secretary-General. We offer him our continued support as he leads the United Nations at this critical juncture in world affairs and seeks to identify meaningful pathways to progress for Member States with differing interests and national priorities.   On 15 January 2008  the citizens of Barbados  in exercise of their democratic right  which they hold sacred  voted in general elections to bring into office the Government of the Democratic Labour Party  which I have the honour to lead. It is a tribute to the good sense of the Barbadian people and to the maturity of our democracy that in our country free and fair elections take place every five years and that the transition to a new Administration is seamless  orderly and peaceful. That exemplary process affords me the opportunity to address the Assembly for the first time today as Prime Minister of Barbados. I am humbled by the confidence the Barbadian people have shown in me and am conscious of the responsibility that now falls upon my Government to respond to the overwhelming call for change that brought us to office.   Barbados is a stable  progressive small State whose high human development rating can be attributed to the emphasis successive generations have placed on the development of social capital. Our country is not endowed with abundant natural resources  and it is therefore our human resources that are our greatest asset.   Within our well-developed social democratic system  the new Barbadian Government will place the greatest priority on policies that nurture the talents and enterprise of individuals and continue to assure our people universal access to quality education  health care  adequate housing and decent working conditions  all within an environment of respect for human rights and the rule of law.   We are well aware that we are now called upon to do that in a time of unprecedented global  economic and social volatility  which is shaking the foundations of societies far larger and more powerful than our own. In these circumstances  my Government’s immediate focus must be on policies that seek to address the high cost of living  which is driven largely by high energy and food prices  to reduce the levels of domestic and international debt and to stabilize the national economy while keeping it competitive. Barbadians are a resilient and resourceful people. We have weathered international storms before  and with strong and competent leadership we will do so again.   In international affairs  Barbados cherishes the reputation it holds as a successful small State whose positions are based on principle and whose actions reflect a profound respect for democratic values. In its engagement with the rest of the world  the Government  which I have the honour to lead  pledges    08-52265 20  to uphold and carry forward the proud traditions of the father of our independence and national hero  the Right Excellent Errol Barrow.   His address to this Assembly as we joined the ranks of sovereign States remains as relevant today as it was when it was first delivered 42 years ago. His clear definition of the parameters of Barbados’ foreign policy is the creed by which our Government and people continue to live. It is perhaps appropriate if I quote his words directly  “We will support genuine efforts at world peace  because our society is stable. We will strenuously assist in the uprooting of vestigial imperialism  because our institutions are free. We will press for the rapid economic growth of all underdeveloped countries  because we are busily engaged in building up our own.  “We have no quarrels to pursue and we particularly insist that we do not regard any Member State as our natural opponent. We shall not involve ourselves in sterile ideological wranglings because we are exponents  not of the diplomacy of power  but of the diplomacy of peace and prosperity. We will not regard any great Power as necessarily right in a given dispute unless we are convinced of this  yet at the same time we will not view the great Powers with perennial suspicion merely on account of their size  their wealth  or their nuclear potential. We will be friends of all  satellites of none.” (A/PV.1487  paras. 76 and 78)  The position of the new Government of Barbados will be guided by that enduring philosophy. Because we are a small island  we will champion the issues of greatest concern to small island developing States. We will argue for the need for special recognition of their inherent vulnerabilities and for sensitive responses to the critical challenges  such as climate change and susceptibility to natural disasters  which constrain their sustainable development.  Because a one-size-fits-all mentality threatens to further marginalize us in the new international trading arrangements  we will continue to show leadership within the group of small vulnerable economies in advocacy efforts to create a regime of special and differential treatment to cater to our unique circumstances.  Because we are a middle-income developing country deemed too successful to qualify for concessionary financing but too high-risk for favourable terms on the capital markets  we will join with like-minded colleagues to lobby for adequate support mechanisms to ensure that our development process is not derailed. Because we are a Caribbean country  we will partner with our fellow Caribbean States to protect our shared patrimony — the Caribbean Sea — from over-exploitation and environmental degradation and to secure our borders from the threats of drug and arms trafficking  money-laundering and terrorism. We are fervent advocates of the notion of the Caribbean as a zone of peace  and we view with great concern any action  from whatever quarter  that seeks to reintroduce the anachronism of cold-war rivalry into our peaceful regional community of nations.   Finally  because we are a responsible member of the international community  and because we believe in the positive role that small States can play in advancing the cause of international peace and equitable social and economic development  we rededicate ourselves to the building of an international system that operates on the principle of multilateralism and that respects the sovereign equality of States and the tenets of genuine non-alignment.  Whatever semantics are used  there is little doubt that we have entered an international economic crisis of grave proportions which threatens to derail the progress of many States and to worsen the already desperate circumstances of the most vulnerable among us. The volatility of oil prices makes managing the economic affairs of our countries a daily challenge  and the escalating cost of basic foods has had immense political and social consequences throughout the world. The signals could not be clearer. Investment in renewable sources of energy such as wind  solar  geothermal and biofuels is imperative. National efforts will certainly not be sufficient  and we will therefore need to forge global partnerships  with increased investment in research and development and meaningful incentives to reverse our excessive dependence on fossil fuels.  The issue of food security is now at the centre of our national and international policy agenda. The measures proposed by United Nations agencies and those agreed upon at the High-level Conference on World Food Security  held in Rome  must now find   21 08-52265  expression in specific programmes and projects. In addition to immediate humanitarian relief for the most severely affected countries  policies must be put in place urgently to boost production and productivity in agriculture and to correct distortions of the market that jeopardize the global supply of food. Crisis situations are often catalysts for creative national action. But the enormity of the current crisis means that for many developing countries national action will have a limited impact unless it is accompanied by a supportive framework of international cooperation and the honouring by the donor community of past commitments for increased resources for development. A successful outcome to November’s Doha Review Conference on Financing for Development must include a genuine global partnership to provide the required financial resources for the achievement of internationally agreed development goals  including the Millennium Development Goals.  The availability of additional financial resources is not  however  the only requirement. Meaningful changes must also be made that will allow for a greater voice  representation and effective participation of developing countries in international decision-making within the international financial institutions. The causes of the present global financial crisis are firmly rooted in the failure of the international community to reform an undemocratic and antiquated system of international economic governance that has not kept pace with the rapid growth of global interdependence. Barbados believes that those responsible for the crisis  and who also created  controlled and manipulated the global financial system for their own advantage  cannot now be trusted to heal it. Developing countries must demonstrate leadership in the search for a lasting solution to the global financial crisis and insist that any exercise to institute reforms must strictly adhere to the principles of openness  transparency and inclusiveness  with the United Nations taking the lead.  The Economic and Social Council must be empowered to play a more meaningful role in global economic decision-making  consistent with the mandate entrusted to it by the United Nations Charter. Even with the recent strengthening of the Council  its current responsibilities fall short of the role envisaged for it by the founders of this Organization. As a member of the Economic and Social Council  Barbados is ready to work with other member States to end the marginalization of the Council from the global economic policy-setting and decision-making processes.   The Economic and Social Council is by no means the only principal organ of the United Nations that is in urgent need of reform. The Security Council as it exists is not representative of the current realities and dynamics of international politics and must be reformed to reflect the situation today. We join those who have called for the start of intergovernmental negotiations on Security Council reform during the sixty-third session.  As Prime Minister of a small island developing State in a region at the epicentre of the global climate crisis  it is my hope that the current international efforts within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to respond to the scientific evidence on climate change prioritize the concerns and needs of these vulnerable developing countries  which are already being affected by the dangerous impacts of climate change. Failure to take urgent  ambitious and decisive action would be nothing short of reckless indifference.  In the wake of the destruction and devastation of the 2008 hurricane season  we in the Caribbean are acutely aware of the precarious nature of our very survival  as well as the urgency attached to action to mitigate the causes of climate change. At the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference in 2009 we must deliver an agreement that is comprehensive  ambitious and inclusive  which adopts a package of mitigation-related activities that will ensure that long-term temperature increases are stabilized well below 2 Celsius degrees above pre-industrial levels  and also provides small island developing States and other vulnerable developing countries with new  additional  predictable and easily accessible sources of funding for adaptation. Time is not on our side.  During the sixty-third session the Assembly will consider a draft resolution entitled “Towards the sustainable development of the Caribbean Sea for present and future generations”  which will again seek to gain international support for the initiative of States members of the Association of Caribbean States to have the Caribbean Sea recognized as a special area within the context of sustainable development. Since the adoption by the General Assembly of resolution 61/197 two years ago  the States members of the Association of Caribbean States have made significant    08-52265 22  strides in developing the institutional and legal framework for Caribbean Sea governance and have collaborated with various civil society stakeholders on measures to ensure sustainable management and conservation of our most precious natural resource. We look forward to continued assistance from the international community in helping us to achieve the objectives of that initiative.  The Government of Barbados looks forward to maintaining the excellent relations that we have enjoyed over these many years with the United Nations. We pledge to continue to uphold the principles of its Charter and will do everything to assist in maintaining an international system and community in which all nations can make their own contribution to the betterment of mankind.

"26",1049,"BRN",63,2008,"Please accept my expression of sincere appreciation to our outgoing President  His Excellency Mr. Srgjan Kerim  and my warmest congratulations to Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session. Brunei Darussalam wishes him every success in the coming year and we offer him our full support.  My congratulations also go to the Government and people of Nicaragua. I offer them my very best wishes for peace  happiness and prosperity. That is a wish  of course  that we also offer all our fellow members. We very much enjoy working with them  sharing experiences  voicing concerns and hearing each other’s thoughts and ideas. I say that because the coming year is a very special one for Brunei Darussalam. In September of next year  we celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of our membership in the United Nations. We thank the Organization and fellow members for giving us the opportunity to play a part in a world we all share.  The global challenges we now face demand that every nation  big and small  work together. That is why we will offer whatever we can to support this world Organization. We will also support all its efforts to address political  economic and social concerns. We will help with recovery from natural disasters. We will join fellow Members in protecting not only the environment but also the cultures of small societies like our own. We will respect the values of the various faiths held by the people this Organization represents.  In more specific terms  that is why Brunei Darussalam strongly supports the role of the United   35 08-51851  Nations in the Quartet working to establish a just and lasting peace in the Middle East. It is why we ask the World Trade Organization to recognize the impact its work has on the stability of small  fragile societies. We ask its strong and influential members not to give up the search for a fair formula for an equitable world trading system acceptable to all nations.  That is also why we acknowledge the work of the Secretary-General with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to help our neighbour Myanmar recover from the terrible effects of Cyclone Nargis this year. It is the reason behind our work with our neighbours in Indonesia and Malaysia to conserve the priceless heritage of the Borneo rainforests by placing over half our territory under environmental protection in the heart of Borneo projects. It is why we affirm the right of all small nations and fragile societies  with all the values they uphold  to continue their way of life with security today and hope for the future. It is why we have supported worldwide dialogue between faiths to promote tolerance and respect for each other’s deepest beliefs.  I offer this appreciation and support for a particular reason. A new generation of international leaders is slowly beginning to shape the future. It is my privilege here to speak not only on behalf of all our people  but especially on behalf of that new generation in our country. The twentieth century is  indeed  history. The twenty-first century is plainly here  creating its new set of internal and external dynamics. We clearly recognize that in my region. That is why ASEAN’s leaders have signed a new charter. We and our fellow members of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) have acknowledged that fact by amending the OIC charter and accepting the far-reaching objectives of the Makkah programme of action.  Underlying both those moves is the deep desire of leaders who are passing the baton to their successors to ensure that their people have hope and confidence in the future by being given the chance to join the twenty-first century. Our people must be able to participate to the fullest. The new generation of leaders must have the opportunity to help them do so. We have to provide that confidence; by that I mean the confidence that comes from education  modern training  health care and the knowledge that their culture  values and faith are safe.   If there is one broad lesson to be learned from the security crises that have marked the start of the century  it is that security is not an abstract concept  nor is it simply the traditional tasks of upholding the law and fighting crime. At its heart  it is a deeply felt feeling of unfairness. What we are asking for is the chance to address those causes at a very basic level.  In that task  we therefore turn to the United Nations for help. We deeply acknowledge the work of the United Nations agencies in the field and their expert staff and selfless volunteers. In particular  we thank the United Nations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the World Health Organization (WHO). We see the success of both of these organizations as essential to providing our people with the confidence I have mentioned.   In Brunei Darussalam  we had the privilege of hosting our first UNESCO science and technology camp in 2006 and we have been deeply impressed by the agencies’ relevance to the needs of ordinary people trying to meet the challenges of the modern world. We especially support the commitment of UNESCO to the process of dialogue and negotiation as the only lasting means of resolving confrontation  no matter how painstaking the process may be at times. In similar fashion  we have also long supported the invaluable work of WHO. We and our neighbours have greatly benefited from the exceptional international research  advice and technical assistance that this organization has constantly offered  and for which we are all most grateful.  I have briefly outlined Brunei Darussalam’s support for the United Nations and its current objectives. Above all  we are committed to the work of its agencies as they attempt to help us all achieve the Millennium Development Goals. I have spoken of how a new generation of leaders can offer their people the hope that comes from confidence in the future. The United Nations is the organization that gives us a fair chance to deliver on this hope. That is all we ask  because for us the twenty-first century presents a difficult journey  and the United Nations is the compass that directs us towards a hopeful future. "
"27",1090,"BTN",63,2008,"As the youngest democracy  having become one in April of this year  my country is honoured  and I am honoured  to have this opportunity to present ourselves before this great world body. In a country that has enjoyed continuous    08-52272 24  justice  stability and progress  democracy came not by the traditional way of struggle and violence  nor by the will of the people. Bhutan became a democracy by the persuasion and personal efforts of a King who worked consistently over 30 years to establish the prerequisites of a democratic culture and institutional arrangements. Having accomplished that noble task  and having set the polity on the final and irreversible path of democracy  our King abdicated the throne as a final mark of his confidence in democracy. He now lives in quiet retirement at the grand old age of 53.  The King has shown that  if leaders themselves are committed to democracy  the transition can be smooth and peaceful. Likewise  if leaders elected to govern believe in it  democracy provides the best means to serve the people. That is the conviction with which my Government will fulfil the powerful mandate that the people have given to us.  As a representative of a country that is deeply committed to multilateralism and that believes firmly in the indispensability of the United Nations system  I seek the indulgence of the Assembly as I offer Bhutan’s perspective from the high Himalayas of our troubled world today.  We are confronted with a host of serious challenges that are testing the relevance of the United Nations and the resolve of its Member States to work together. Natural disasters  food  fuel and financial crises  deepening poverty  failing States  dwindling water resources  diseases  human trafficking and even maritime lawlessness afflict our society. And then there is terrorism and extremism of the most barbaric and cowardly kind  using the weak and the deranged to kill and maim the innocent.  All those challenges threaten to undermine what we have achieved collectively and as individual States. They directly thwart our slow progress in the pursuit of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  which I believe are among the most laudable consensual agreements achieved by this Assembly to bring about a more just and equitable world  indeed  a more civilized world.  Bhutan does not look at those developments as separate  disconnected events. Rather  we see them as directly interconnected symptoms of a larger and deeper malaise that threatens our collective well-being and survival. Responding to each of the challenges separately will most probably be useful in the short term  but piecemeal efforts will not lead to permanent solutions. We need to treat the disease beyond the symptoms. And the disease  we believe  has to do with our way of life  which is simply not rational and sustainable.  One does not need to be an economist to understand that the oil crisis  soaring price of metals and diminishing water reserves have to do with the fact that for too long we have been exploiting and wasting our scarce natural resources. At the very least  these developments are market reactions and attempts to reflect the true value of these resources.  As for the financial crisis  it is becoming quite clear that its main cause lies in our culture of living beyond our means  of private profiteering  of socializing risks. Unfortunately  the possible solution seems to lie in transferring our debt to future generations  who are not here to argue against it.  It is not difficult to see how all these crises are the result of a way of life that is dictated by the powerful ethics of consumerism in a world of finite resources. Our life is all about fear of not having enough  about wanting more and doing better than our dear neighbour and friend. We spend and consume far beyond our means and those of generations unborn.  As we go on expanding our economies by extracting natural resources  raising productivity  increasing consumption and discharging immeasurable volumes of polluting waste  the climate is changing. Striking unpredictably  unseasonably and with greater fury and frequency  natural disasters such as drought  cyclones  hurricanes  floods and landslides are destroying life  property and crops. Weather patterns have changed and continue to change  with far more profound implications for our civilization than we can fathom. We even wonder whether earthquakes and tsunamis may have something to do with climate change.  Yesterday  we huddled together to find solutions to the food crisis and the danger of growing hunger in a world where already too many are starving. Diseases abound and new epidemics threaten humanity  other life forms and crops even as medicine and technology combine to conspire against mortality. Are these not signals from a planet grossly abused? Could these not be pleas to mend our ways and to search for a more sustainable way of life?   25 08-52272   Deepening poverty  not unlike the food crisis  is also a sign of the disintegration of communities. As communities die  so does the spirit of sharing  borrowing and giving amid good neighbourliness in times of need  as opposed to competing and making gains at the cost of community  neighbour and even one’s own family. It is about the failure of human relationships  including between and among States. This  I believe  lies at the root of the poverty  hunger  instability and insecurity that plague much of the world today.  These multiple crises bring into sharp focus the shameful inequities of our society  which fails to share and to distribute the enormous wealth it has created to satisfy man’s insatiable greed. People suffer from hunger  thirst and exposure to the elements and die without treatment not because we do not have enough food  water  clothes or medicine  but because we do not have the will to share and the care to distribute.  Only yesterday  I was wondering how many tons of food and medicine must be taken off the shelves of Manhattan stores and put into the incinerator at the end of each day as they become stale or reach their date of expiry. On the other hand  even to this day  few developed countries have fulfilled their pledge to share less than 1 per cent of their gross national product (GNP) with developing countries. Likewise  the pharmaceutical companies have convincing arguments to offer against lowering the cost of medicines.  We need to wake up from our narcissistic slumber and self-indulgence and realize that economic well-being is not human well-being. We must break away from the shackles of the powerful forces of the market. For that matter  could the unravelling of the market-based economy  as evident in the financial crisis  be a glimpse of the truth that mindless and irresponsible economic growth and expansion cannot go on? It is neither sustainable nor fair to future generations. Above all  we could be condemning our own selves to an old age of burdensome debt and regret.  That brings us to the question of whether our fundamentals are sound. Is the GDP-led growth that has served as our measure of progress good enough for the future? What are the foundations of our civilizations and the values that guide us? As we get richer and live by the terms that we have set for ourselves  are we truly becoming more civilized  or are we trapped in a downward spiral of de-civilization?  I ask again: does economic growth translate as human development? Are we mutating to become senseless robots programmed to be materially productive  to earn more  to want more  to consume more and more of what we do not need and will ultimately destroy us?  As human beings  should we not search for and be driven by higher values? Do we not have needs beyond material ones  beyond that of the body alone? Can we conceptualize a holistic alternative paradigm for meaningful and sustainable development that places the well-being of the individual and community at the centre and gives cause for true happiness  as opposed to fleeting pleasures?  I am pleased to submit that many academic institutions and researchers across the world are engaged in such a search and are making progress. The latest to join is the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development  which has hosted a series of regional and world conferences to develop indicators to measure true human progress.  My country  Bhutan  is one such entity. While being actively involved as a partner in the global efforts in this regard  we have pursued a unique development path  guided by our former King’s philosophy of Gross National Happiness (GNH)  since the early 1970s. GNH is based on the belief that happiness is the single most important goal and purpose in life for every individual and that the end of development must be the promotion and enhancement of happiness. It must  therefore  we believe  be the responsibility of the State to create an enabling environment within which its citizens can pursue happiness.  The concept emphasizes a balanced life  matching the material needs of the body with the spiritual  psychological and emotional needs of the mind. To that end  the Royal Government structured its development programmes around four broad themes  or pillars  that constitute a paradigm for holistic and sustainable development. These are: sustainable and equitable socio-economic development  not growth; environmental conservation; the promotion of culture; and good governance. Since the 1970s we have never wavered from that path  thanks greatly to the generosity and support of our development partners. The former King never faltered  sacrificing his own    08-52272 26  reign to leave the legacy of a unique democracy and a country that is peaceful  progressive and happy.  I urge the members of the Assembly to reflect on those and other considerations so that such crises as have now stricken us may never reappear  so that we can return each year to this Assembly and find reasons to smile and to be happy. To that end  Mr. President  please be assured of Bhutan’s fullest support for and cooperation with you and the Secretary-General."
"28",1131,"BWA",63,2008,"I am delighted  Sir  to congratulate you on your assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session. Your election to that high office is indeed a clear reflection of the strong confidence and trust that the international community has in you personally  and also in your great country  Nicaragua. I am confident that under your able guidance we will continue to build on the achievements of the sixty-second session in our efforts to advance our common global agenda towards a more just  secure and prosperous world. I assure you of the full support  cooperation and goodwill of the delegation of the Republic of Botswana in the discharge of your mandate.  I wish also to pay tribute to your predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Srgjan Kerim  President of the Assembly at its sixth-second session. We sincerely commend him for his sterling work and leadership  which enabled us to achieve critical milestones towards our common goals.  This year marks the sixtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This is an important event on our global human rights agenda. It is an occasion for Member States to reflect  individually and collectively  on how much progress we have made in our efforts to build a more just world order. The Universal Declaration embodies the aspirations of humanity for liberty  freedom and equality. It is a reflection of the human spirit to strive for a more perfect society in which individuals recognize the reality that creating the space for the enjoyment of individual human rights expands the horizons for society to realize its full potential.  In pursuance of this noble objective we must continuously strive to improve our governance in order to ensure that it is responsive to the wishes of the people. It should be borne in mind that  in the final analysis  it is the people in whom the sovereignty of any nation is vested. In that respect  it is imperative that the will of the people expressed in free and fair elections be respected by all political leaders. Heads of State or Government must avoid the temptation to change constitutions in an effort to prolong their stay in power  which often results in instability.  Botswana reaffirms its commitment to the ideals and purposes of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We are determined to contribute to the promotion of respect for human rights at home and abroad. In doing so we are conscious of the need for international cooperation in the promotion of human rights. It is for this reason that Botswana is a State party to a number of human rights instruments  including the Rome Statute on the establishment of the International Criminal Court.   We fully support the work of that Court. As a country that strongly believes in the rule of law  we are convinced that there should be no political interference in the work of the Court. The International Criminal Court was established with the support of African States. We felt that it was necessary to address problems that confronted our continent. The Court is meant to serve a specific purpose and there should be no exceptions regarding what it can or cannot do.   21 08-53135   Botswana is pleased that representatives of political parties in Zimbabwe finally signed an agreement in Harare on 15 September 2008. We welcomed that development  as it augurs well for national reconciliation  economic reconstruction and development in Zimbabwe. The effective implementation of the agreement should have a positive impact not only on developments in Zimbabwe but also on Southern Africa and the wider African region. This is a good beginning  and we encourage the parties to do all they can to make the agreement work. No party should attempt to obstruct the implementation of the agreement  as the political crisis that confronted that country following the 29 June 2008 presidential run-off election can be resolved only through the implementation of the agreement. Such a development would not be acceptable to Botswana. We call upon the international community to help the process to succeed by extending their goodwill and support to the Government and the people of Zimbabwe with much-needed economic  financial and technical assistance.  We must commend the former President of the Republic of South Africa  His Excellency Mr. Thabo Mbeki  for his hard work  commitment and determination in helping the Zimbabweans reach agreement. We also wish to pay tribute to former President Mbeki for his contribution to the attainment of freedom and democracy not only in South Africa but also in the wider African continent. We are grateful to him for his visionary leadership and his people-centred initiatives  whose primary objective was to build an African continent that is free  peaceful  democratic and economically prosperous.  As the international community  we have the collective responsibility to equip and make optimal use of our multilateral body  the United Nations  to search for fair and just solutions to global problems in order to contribute to the betterment of all humanity. Today  more than ever before  the United Nations is required to respond effectively and swiftly to the complex challenges of the twenty-first century. Conflicts  poverty  disease  natural and man-made disasters  climate change  energy and terrorism are among the myriad pressing problems that confront humanity and require an urgent global response. It is thus imperative that we continue to make concerted efforts to address those challenges in pursuit of a better tomorrow. Their magnitude clearly requires multilateral strategies and solutions.  Botswana calls upon all Members to unite in the search for solutions to those problems. It is imperative that in our policies  actions and pronouncements  we always seek to build greater international understanding. In our approach to managing relations between States  leaders are called upon to set a higher standard. The language that we employ in international forums should not be belligerent or provocative  nor should it be calculated to shame or humiliate other leaders. Member States should not host military or rebel groups that operate from their territories against their neighbours.  In our international discourse  we must aim to build and facilitate agreement on common goals. In that respect  we must exercise restraint by avoiding the often frequent temptation to recall diplomats from each other’s capitals  including purely for solidarity reasons. Such action is unfortunate and outdated  as it only leads to a breakdown in communication.  As we meet here  let us always remind ourselves of the solemn commitments that we  as the peoples of the world  have undertaken to end war and human suffering. Botswana calls upon all States  especially the major Powers  to set an example by refraining from the use of weapons in resolving conflicts. Military confrontation is  unfortunately  always a demonstration of the failure of the will to use diplomacy  of the urge to show off military superiority or of the inability to employ resources and technological advances to improve human lives.  Sustainable economic growth  development and the eradication of poverty are central to our development agenda as developing countries. Poverty is undoubtedly one of the most critical challenges facing our people. Achieving the Millennium Development Goals and combating poverty in its many dimensions are interrelated and mutually reinforcing objectives. Thus  their attainment should be our primary preoccupation.  Botswana welcomes the initiatives introduced by some development partners that seek to take a more focused approach to Africa’s economic and development problems. Those initiatives include the Lomé Conventions and the successor arrangements between the African  Caribbean and Pacific States  on the one hand  and the European Union  on the other; the African Growth and Opportunity Act of the United States; the Tokyo International Conference on African    08-53135 22  Development; the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation; and the Africa-India Framework for Cooperation.  Botswana has always made effective use of the resources made available by our cooperating partners. It is important that more be done to help developing countries embark on the path of sustainable development. We are convinced that  as we receive much-needed assistance  we must envisage a day and time when there will be no need for such assistance because we are all able to stand on our own.  This year marks the midpoint towards the 2015 target for attaining the Millennium Development Goals. We thank the Secretary-General for his analytical and informative reports regarding progress in the implementation of our common commitments and our shared future. We also welcome the work of the high-level meetings held to take stock of progress made. That will no doubt provide impetus for the expeditious implementation of our commitments.  The Secretary-General’s reports indicate a mixed and uneven score. It is clearly evident that while we have made real progress in some areas  much remains to be done over the next seven years if we are to achieve our goals. In other words  we are seriously behind schedule on every target  among countries and within countries that need to eradicate poverty and reduce human suffering.  In addition to revealing gaps  the process has highlighted emerging challenges that hinder the attainment of targets across the spectrum of human development. It has also emphasized the serious need to fast-track the pace of implementation if we are to have any notable impact. The achievement of those goals is our shared responsibility. It is thus imperative that all of us  individually and collectively  do our part to accelerate progress towards a better quality of life for our people.  Our people deserve a life free from fear and want  in an environment that offers equal opportunity for all. That is not a privilege  but a fundamental human right that each State has a duty to respect  protect and fulfil. For our people  that should mean universal access to education  health  shelter  clean water and infrastructure  as well as living in a safe and secure environment. Fully honouring our commitments is the key to realizing those expectations.  The following facts should trouble our collective conscience. More than one quarter of the children younger than 5 in the developing world are underweight. That amounts to 143 million underweight children in developing countries. Children in developing countries continue to die from preventable diseases such as malaria. The approximately 4 billion cases of diarrhoea per annum cause 2.2 million deaths  mostly among children under 5. Approximately 6 million people are blind as a result of trachoma  a disease caused by lack of clean water combined with poor hygiene practices. In sub-Saharan Africa  a woman’s lifetime risk of maternal death is a staggering 1 in 22  compared with 1 in 8 000 in industrialized countries. Finally  HIV is spreading faster than we can provide universal access to prevention  treatment  support and care.  Clearly  closing those gaps will entail more than our reaffirmations; it urgently necessitates sustained and strong political commitment and leadership; sound and appropriate national policies  matched with increased official development assistance and technical support from the international system; stepped-up participation and combined efforts by Governments  civil society and the private sector; fairer  transparent and inclusive international trade regimes; more global partnerships to assist developing countries; full implementation of debt-relief initiatives; greater access to markets; and other innovative international support measures to finance development.  The search for global peace and security remains a matter of vital interest to my delegation. While we may have made significant strides in promoting peace through conflict prevention and resolution  through post-conflict recovery and through peacebuilding  conflicts continue to flare up  thus making the restoration of peace a remote possibility for some in the world.  My own continent  Africa  plays host to a large number of conflicts. The scourge of war has claimed many lives and caused untold human suffering. Substantial time  energy and financial resources have been expended  with little or no success. The United Nations Charter implores us  as the international community  to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war by employing all diplomatic efforts and tools at our disposal.   23 08-53135   I am pleased to note that commendable strides have been made in placing some countries  such as Liberia  Sierra Leone and Guinea-Bissau  on a firm path of national reconstruction  post-conflict recovery and peacebuilding. Regrettably  the peoples of Africa continue to face hunger and death in the Darfur region of the Sudan  Somalia and Chad  among other places.   My delegation is particularly concerned about the ever-worsening situation in the Darfur region of the Sudan. It is disconcerting that armed hostilities continue  despite the efforts of the United Nations and the African Union through the development of the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur. We call on the parties to commit to political dialogue in the search for lasting peace and to fully utilize the good offices of His Excellency Mr. Djibril Bassole  who has recently been appointed to facilitate the peace process.  With respect to Somalia  Botswana welcomes the signing of the Djibouti Agreement on 9 June 2008 by the Transitional Federal Government of Somalia and the Alliance for the Re-Liberation of Somalia. We call upon all Somali political forces to commit to an all-inclusive political process so that the long-suffering people of Somali can also live in peace.   My delegation further calls on the international community to continue assisting the people of Somali with much-needed humanitarian aid. In the same vein  we remind the political leaders of the Somali people to put the interests of the people of Somalia above their own  so that the focus can be on the search for a lasting political settlement to the problems facing their country.  The success of the United Nations in delivering on our expectations and common ideals must be matched by adequate resources  appropriate mandates  structures and policy guidance. Botswana strongly believes in the instrumentality of the United Nations. In that regard  we are committed to paying our assessed contributions in full and on time. We therefore call upon all Members to do the same  so that this machinery  which is the motor that powers multilateralism  does not run out of steam.  There can be no doubt that any organization — and the United Nations in particular — must be constantly reformed or renewed if it is to continue to be relevant and responsive to the needs of its members. We are pleased that there has been some measure of progress in implementing the set of reforms mandated by the 2005 World Summit.  Allow me to conclude my remarks by once again calling on each and every one of us to live up to the high expectations of this Organization by honouring our commitments. Botswana reaffirms its abiding faith in this body  which unites the peoples of the world for a higher purpose. It is our hope that as we meet here  we will succeed in building greater international understanding across regions  cultures  language and faiths  because we are all human and because of the humanity of others.

"29",1174,"CAF",63,2008,"First  I sincerely congratulate Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session. The role played by his country  Nicaragua  in pursuing the purposes of the United Nations and his long and distinguished career as a diplomat have been recognized by his election. I assure him of my country’s support and my own support as he carries out his difficult and noble mission.  I also pay Mr. Srgjan Kerim  who presided over the sixty-second session  a well deserved tribute for the excellent work he did throughout his term in office.  I wish to express words of encouragement to the Secretary-General  Mr Ban Ki-moon  for the important direction he has given our Organization since taking up his duties.  My country  the Central African Republic  has since 1996 experienced domestic instability fuelled by the effects of numerous conflicts in neighbouring territories. The Darfur crisis and the constant incursions of irregular armed bands in the north-east and north-west and of the Lord’s Resistance Army on the southern frontier  bordering on the Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo  have been accompanied by plunder  rape  deportation and the conscription of children under the age of 10.  The use of that part of the Central African Republic territory as a rear base for non-State armed elements represents a danger of the same type as those that led to Security Council resolution 1778 (2007).  I welcome the mandate given to the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic and Chad (MINURCAT) as part of a multidimensional operation to restore the safety and security conditions needed for a voluntary and lasting return of refugees and persons displaced by the conflicts in that area of the three frontiers that straddle the Central African Republic  Chad and the Sudan.   However  with the mandate of the European Union Force (EUFOR) ending in March 2009  and because of the fragility of the situation in the north-east and growing insecurity in the south-east  it is highly desirable that MINURCAT’s mission be revised and enlarged. We earnestly hope that it will go beyond its    08-51839 34  current framework to become an operational force of the United Nations  and that cooperation between MINURCAT and the other forces involved at the regional and community levels will continue.  Referring to the situation in my country gives me the opportunity to emphasize that the recurrent political and military crises have further increased poverty and food insecurity  particularly in the rural and agricultural areas.  A suggested theme for this year’s general debate — the impact of the world food crisis on poverty and hunger throughout the world — in addition to the need to democratize the United Nations  is at the heart of the international community’s concerns  and has been for some decades. The first matter involves the following questions: climate conditions  demographic problems  indebtedness  free and equitable trade  redirecting the agricultural sector towards biofuels  the price of oil and armed conflicts.  In the current context of world trade and the world economy  there is a tendency for natural disasters and armed conflicts  because of their effect on socio-economic structures  to accentuate the impact of the food crisis on developing countries.  For the Central African Republic  the food crisis can be seen as somewhat paradoxical  in view of our natural potential. The climate throughout the country is favourable to pluvial agriculture  with an enviable annual rainfall of 800 millimetres in the extreme north and more than 1 500 millimetres in the south  and an availability of fresh water estimated at 37 000 cubic metres per inhabitant.   Of more than 15 million hectares of arable land  only 600 000 to 700 000 are cultivated. That is 1 per cent of our national territory and 4.4 per cent of the total arable area. Less than 0.5 million hectares are being actively exploited by agricultural workers.  Stock-raising land represents 9.3 million hectares out of a total of 16 million  with livestock totalling about 3.2 million head of tropical breeds.  The challenges to be overcome are the insecurity of rural areas  the disorganization of agricultural producers  the low degree of support for the rural community  the fact of being landlocked  the lack of basic economic and social infrastructures  the exodus from the countryside and the impact of HIV/AIDS and malaria  which have reduced the labour force and resulted in limited access to credit and fostered social discrimination.  One of the Millennium Development Goals is to halve  between 1996 and 2015  the number of those suffering from hunger  and to halve  between 1990 and 2015  the degree of poverty.  There are a number of causes of the problems:  so-called natural causes and human causes. The natural causes result from natural disasters: drought  desertification  degradation of the environment and floods  resulting in the erosion of arable land. Human causes are regarded as having been responsible for more than 35 per cent of the food emergencies in 2004  compared with only 15 per cent in 1992. Wars and economic and social upheaval have caused or worsened the food situation.  The General Assembly is the appropriate forum in which to raise and debate the problems confronting our world today. That is what is expected of us in the Assembly.  There is no human endeavour that will not respond to application. Therefore  it is possible to meet the challenge of the food crisis. But our weakness is above all our lack of the technical  economic and structural capacity to create the conditions for agricultural production and productivity.  I welcome the measures taken in June this year at the World Food Summit of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)  held in Rome  on the food crisis. The initiative on the upswing in the price of foodstuffs should mainly be based on stimulating food production in our countries. For that  we look forward to implementation of the International Monetary Fund proposal to double its aid to agriculture on the African continent  in the hope of strengthening the productive capacity of our farmers and creating the structural conditions for the production and marketing of agricultural goods.  As part of regional talks on the food crisis  held in Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of the Congo on 29 July this year  under the aegis of the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS)  it was agreed to make effective the Maputo Declaration and the Abuja Declaration on  respectively  allocating 10 per cent of our national budget to agriculture and assuring our countries better access to resources for agriculture.   35 08-51839   We have also given ECCAS a mandate to  among other actions  accelerate implementation of a common agricultural policy. Relaunching the agricultural sector is one of the priorities of my mandate as President of the Central African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC). At the Yaoundé summit in June this year we decided to put that concern at the centre of the regional economic programme.  None of these good resolutions can become reality for our farmers unless the support promised to them actually reaches them. Particularly in Central Africa  if these promises are kept they will speed up the putting into place of regional focal points for development that will help to reduce the shortfalls in agricultural activity and the disparities between rural and urban areas.  Food security has become a matter of concern for the world. Hunger continues to be the worst weapon of mass destruction. The social crises seen in many places result from the realization that food insecurity is worsening with the rising cost of living and other uncertainties  such as climate change and natural disasters.  In Central Africa  because of the destructive action of irregular military rebel groups  many manipulated from outside  food insecurity  particularly in rural areas  is often provoked by lack of security. That led the Government to organize  in April this year  a national seminar on reforming the security sector  which was an important step towards peace.  In the light of this  the process of inclusive political dialogue  which I have pledged to carry through to its conclusion  should be seen by all Central Africans as a categorical imperative.  Today  millions of people throughout the world are increasingly losing their means of subsistence because of the impact of food insecurity and of the steep rise in oil prices on the world economy  with unprecedented consequences for world order and peace.  Hunger  the environment  corruption and civil and ethnic conflicts are a burden for the most impoverished peoples on earth.  Other threats  such as terrorism  poverty and misgovernment  also contribute to making the world even more vulnerable  and demand from us responses and methods that will bring about a lasting solution.  In this age of interdependence of States  the prime solution and imperative need seems to be a collective decision-making forum and an instrument for rapid action. That was the vision of the founders of our Organization in 1945.  But we must recognize today that the various institutions that make up the United Nations have their limitations  and we must agree on the need for reform to make the Organization much more effective in order to achieve the Millennium Development Goals and seek the kind of peace that meets the current situation.  My country is convinced of the importance of genuine democratization of the United Nations system. In that connection  particular attention should be given to the functioning of the Security Council  the Economic and Social Council  the Bretton Woods institutions and the General Assembly. If together we take courageous decisions to implement this ambitious project  we shall give the world an ideal structure that can tackle all international questions. This is an opportunity to build a world that is more secure  more equitable  more balanced and freer for all peoples. "
"30",1221,"CAN",63,2008,"I am honoured to be here today on behalf of the Government of Canada to once again reaffirm my country’s commitment to a strong and effective United Nations. (spoke in French)  For Canada  the United Nations remains indispensable for addressing the many global challenges that confront us today  be it the search for peace and security  the promotion of human rights  democracy and international development  combating terrorism or the protection of the environment. (spoke in English)  Those challenges require collective and cooperative strategies. They cannot be tackled by any one country acting alone. That is why we must redouble our efforts to make the United Nations more effective and efficient so that it can deliver real results.  Today  I would like to speak to the Assembly about Canada’s priority global engagements  and how they are helping to achieve the fundamental objectives of this Organization.  From the very founding of the United Nations  Canada has contributed ideas  action and resources to help to fulfil its mandate. We helped to develop the concept of peacekeeping. We helped it to meet the changing nature of security  when more robust action was required to end conflict  to protect civilians caught in the crossfire or to build peace in its aftermath. We have served in successive peacekeeping and peacemaking operations and today we are serving on the Peacebuilding Commission.  Today  Canada is contributing to peace and security and making sacrifices in places as diverse as Afghanistan  Haiti and the Sudan. Each of those Canadian engagements flows from a United Nations mandate.  Canada’s largest and most important overseas engagement is in Afghanistan  where we have more than 2 500 Canadians on the ground in support of the Security Council-mandated International Security Assistance Force. Canada continues to call for safe and unhindered humanitarian access to all those in need in Afghanistan. We condemn in the strongest possible terms the attack of 14 September against members of a United Nations convoy in Kandahar province who were carrying out a polio vaccination campaign for Afghan children.  Sadly  the Government of Afghanistan and the international community are all too familiar with such brutal and cowardly tactics. We will not be swayed from our efforts to improve the lives of ordinary Afghans. To that end  at the International Conference in Support of Afghanistan in Paris  Canada announced that it would make an additional contribution of $600 million for Afghanistan  bringing its overall total to $1.9 billion over the period from 2001 to 2011.  Continued leadership by the United Nations is essential in Afghanistan. Canada stands behind the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan. We call on Member States to work with the United Nations to enhance the capacity of the Mission and to give it the tools required to do its job. We remain ever mindful   17 08-53141  of the challenges that Afghanistan continues to confront — security  access to basic services and impending food shortages. Collectively  we — the States assembled here — must deliver on the promises made to the Afghan people. (spoke in French)  Canada also remains committed to the promotion of security  governance and development in Haiti  efforts that are important for building a more democratic  prosperous and secure hemisphere. We consider the partnership with the United Nations in Haiti to be an integral part of those efforts. That is why we are providing the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) with civilian police officers  military staff officers and corrections experts.  Canada takes a comprehensive approach to reconstruction and development in Haiti. We are the second largest bilateral donor in Haiti  with a $555 million commitment over five years through 2011 in support of the country’s long-term reconstruction and development. MINUSTAH is in Haiti at the request of the Haitian Government  the most important partner of all in a commitment we share with Member States within the hemisphere and beyond. Sustained efforts  political stability and lasting progress on reforms will combine to build a better future for all Haitians.  Canada has also been a long-standing partner of the United Nations efforts in Africa. When the Secretary-General took office  he said that one of his top priorities would be the Sudan’s Darfur region. The United Nations presence in the Sudan is based on the very principles underlying the United Nations Charter. The engagement of the international community in the Sudan remains vital. (spoke in English)  With contributions of over $477 million since 2006  Canada remains deeply committed to building sustainable peace in the Sudan and alleviating the suffering of those affected by the conflict. Canada’s support for peacekeeping operations in Sudan includes the deployment of personnel  a loan of armoured vehicles and a large voluntary financial contribution. Canada underscores the importance of full implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement  and calls on Sudanese authorities and the rebel movements to end the violence in Darfur  facilitate the deployment of the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID)  cooperate with the International Criminal Court and respect human rights.  We are acutely aware that UNAMID is a difficult and often dangerous mission. In that regard  allow me to express the sincere condolences of the Canadian Government for the deaths resulting from the helicopter crash in the Sudan earlier today — a tragedy that underscores the very real threats United Nations personnel continue to confront in the field.  The current crisis in Georgia also calls for a unified international response. Canada supports the democratic and legitimate Government of Georgia and Georgia’s territorial integrity and sovereignty. Canada calls on Russia to fulfil its international obligations  reconsider its actions and cooperate fully with the international community to resolve the crisis in Georgia in a peaceful manner.  Canada has consistently sought to make the United Nations instruments for promoting peace and security more effective. At the centre of those is  of course  the Security Council. Canada has long supported proposals for greater accountability and transparency of the Security Council to enable it better to shoulder the global peace and security responsibilities entrusted to it by the 192 Member States. Canada is committed to working with all Member States to promote a more unified and effective Security Council that can move past stalemate and take decisive action against threats to security wherever they may arise.  We therefore welcome the recent decision of the General Assembly to launch negotiations on Security Council reform at this session. It is important that we make progress in those negotiations. For our part  Canada stands ready to support reform that ensures that new realities are reflected in the Council while preserving accountability through the discipline of regular elections for Security Council membership.  Canada is proud to be the seventh largest contributor to the regular budget of the United Nations. We are also a member of a wide range of United Nations specialized agencies and a major contributor to United Nations funds and programmes. Humanitarianism and compassion are hallmarks of the Canadian identity. The United Nations is a key partner for the delivery of Canadian humanitarian action  with    08-53141 18  Canadian commitments this year totalling over $315 million. Our humanitarian assistance is aimed at helping the world’s most vulnerable people  including children  refugees and victims of conflict and natural disasters  and supports key United Nations programmes in those areas.  Canada is on track to meet its international assistance commitments  and we are ensuring that our aid is focused  effective and accountable. Canada will deliver on its promise to double international assistance to $5 billion by 2010-2011.  Canada is also serious about its commitment  undertaken in the Group of Eight  to double aid to Africa  and I am pleased to say that we are on target to meet that goal in 2009. Canada is also committed to working in partnership with other stakeholders to accelerate development efforts to help achieve the Millennium Development Goals by 2015.  In response to the global food crisis  Canada provided an extra $50 million for food aid  bringing our total contribution this year to $230 million — one of the largest in the world. Canada was also pleased to answer an emergency request from the World Food Programme (WFP) earlier this month to provide security for its food aid shipments to Somalia. A Canadian Navy frigate  HMCS Ville de Québec  is currently escorting WFP ships carrying life-saving supplies to Somalia. Canada recently extended the frigate’s WFP escort mission until 23 October 2008.  Canada is taking further concrete measures to enhance the effectiveness of our aid. We recently untied 100 per cent of our food aid to make sure it can be provided in the most efficient and effective way possible to the people who need it most. Canada is also fully untying all of its development assistance programmes by 2012-2013  in fulfilment of our commitment to ensuring greater effectiveness of our international assistance.  The challenges of environmental protection and sustainable development are rightly at the top of the global agenda. The most pressing challenge is that of climate change  and the United Nations must play a central role. Canada is committed to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the need to reach consensus on a post-Bali framework.   The response to all global challenges begins at home. However  the sum of national actions must drive a collective effort at the international level. One of the most important components of the Bali Road Map is that it recognizes that no country can effectively address climate change on its own and that all countries in a position to act must do so. As such  Canada is fully aware of the importance of having all major global emitters take on meaningful and binding emissions reduction commitments in any future international agreement.  Canada is also acutely aware of the risks faced by countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change  particularly small island States and the least developed countries. Canada is pleased to be a sponsor of a draft resolution on climate change and security put forward by the Pacific Island States. Canada has also supported global efforts to promote climate change adaptation and has contributed both expertise and finances to various United Nations and other international initiatives.  Sixty years ago  this body adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Canada is proud to recall the contribution of Canadian John Peters Humphrey in penning the initial draft of that landmark instrument. Sixty years on  we have not yet met that “common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations” (resolution 217 (III)). We have much work left to do.  As a member of the Human Rights Council  Canada is working hard to make that new institution live up to the reform objectives that led to its creation two years ago. We have seen some progress and some setbacks in ensuring that the Council’s agenda and focus are balanced and objective.  We must continually challenge ourselves to improve our own records. The creation this year of the Universal Periodic Review  which Canada strongly supported as an innovative improvement to the United Nations human rights machinery  is an important tool to help States identify and address their continuing challenges.  As a community  we must stand up for the rule of law and for those whose rights are violated or undermined by the very institutions that should ensure their protection. That is why Canada will continue to take strong stands against Governments that commit systemic abuses against their populations. As   19 08-53141  Governments  we must remain committed to working together to hold each other to account on our human rights records and to support countries that are making sincere efforts to advance the human rights of their people. We must continue to strive for fundamental freedoms and human rights in order to fulfil the ideals of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. (spoke in French)  Canada supports an effective  soundly managed and results-driven United Nations. That is why it supports broad reform. In that regard  we call for extensive reform in terms of management  especially in the areas of oversight  accountability and human resource management. Those reforms are needed to bring the management of the United Nations in step with the best practices of the twenty-first century and to equip it with the tools needed to deliver on the important mandates that we as Member States ask of it. (spoke in English)  The values and ideals on which the United Nations was founded — the promotion of peace and security  of human rights and of greater prosperity for all through development cooperation — are also Canada’s and we stand ready to work within the United Nations to address new challenges  such as climate change and combating terrorism. I wish to repeat Canada’s willingness to work in partnership with all United Nations Member States towards the common purposes for which this Organization was created. "
"31",1236,"CHE",63,2008,"I have the honour to speak on behalf of the President of the Swiss Confederation  Mr. Pascal Couchepin  who had to cancel his trip to New York at the very last minute.  Since its foundation  the United Nations has embodied the hope of all people to live in peace  freedom and dignity. As Members of the United Nations and as representatives of our peoples  we are under an obligation not to disappoint those hopes. Three years ago in this Hall  we decided in the 2005 World Summit Outcome to ensure that human beings would live in freedom and dignity  free from poverty and despair. We ought now to ask ourselves the following questions: Have we kept that promise? Have the expectations been fulfilled? Have we done enough to bring about peace and security  development and the realization of human rights?  According to a recent World Bank report  the number of people living in poverty has fallen by 500 million since 1981. Their proportion of the total population has fallen from 52 to 26 per cent. Nevertheless  1.2 billion people still have to get by on less than a dollar a day. Twenty-five thousand people a day are dying as a result of starvation and poverty. There are still 67 million refugees and internally displaced persons on the planet. No State  however wealthy or powerful  can tackle all these challenges alone. Common solutions are required. A strong United Nations is needed  a United Nations that focuses on that which unites rather than on that which divides.  Cooperation across cultural and religious borders is not always easy. Swiss history has shown that this type of cooperation is most likely to bear fruit when specific problems are tackled and solutions are sought through open dialogue. This approach is reflected in Swiss peace policy. We support projects the purpose of which is to bring together people with different values and cultural backgrounds to enable them to coexist in a positive way. This approach also characterizes our activity in the United Nations-sponsored Alliance of Civilizations.  Although dialogue is necessary  it is nevertheless only one of the means of promoting the fundamental values to which we are all devoted. I am thinking first and foremost of human rights  access to a decent standard of living and personal development for everyone.  In this context  Switzerland is participating actively in the work of the Human Rights Council. Let us recall that the usefulness of the Council will ultimately be judged by the specific contribution that it makes to the protection of human rights on the ground.   33 08-53141  The Universal Periodic Review and its special procedures provide the Council with two effective tools  and those tools must be used. Switzerland will continue to advocate in favour of a constructive and critical Universal Periodic Review  the independence of special procedures and the autonomy of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.  Next year  the Review Conference on the implementation of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action will take place at Durban. For Switzerland  the fight against racism is a priority. That is why my country will play its part in this process. However  we expect the preparatory phase to be characterized by a constructive spirit that helps us achieve a balanced outcome. In particular  the Review Conference should confine itself to the evaluation of the implementation of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action. It should not call into question the normative advances set out in the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. And finally  it should deal with different subjects relating to racism in a balanced manner  without becoming a platform that focuses on a particular situation.  Last week  the Assembly also discussed the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals. We all know that the implementation of the Goals is slow and arduous. Collectively  we could have done more. We should have done more  and Switzerland is no exception. But we are trying to assign our limited resources to actions that meet the needs of recipients  that make a difference to the poorest  that help people to help themselves and that complement  but do not replace  the efforts of recipient countries.  Development assistance should be characterized by lasting effectiveness and coherence. The Follow-Up International Conference on Financing for Development  to be held in Doha  will give us an opportunity to renew and to deepen this alliance between developing and industrialized countries.  Progress towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals requires that the world’s poorest be better protected legally. Only if they can defend themselves against injustice and have equal access to justice  property  work and markets will development ultimately be possible. The Commission on Legal Empowerment of the Poor presented its report a few months ago. It deserves careful study and follow-up by the Assembly.  The food crisis has undoubtedly made achieving the Millennium Development Goals more difficult. Like some other countries  Switzerland has responded to the crisis by increasing its contribution to the World Food Programme. But the causes of food price rises also need to be addressed. The causes are diverse and range from changing eating habits to increased cultivation of agrofuel crops and neglect of agricultural production. Measures to resolve this crisis will have to be both numerous and varied. In this regard  we welcome the efforts made by the High-Level Task Force on the Global Food Security Crisis in providing a coherent and efficient response.  However  there is also a positive side to this crisis. Rising food prices may also represent an opportunity for farmers in developing countries. But for farmers to benefit from the rise in food prices they need access to land and property  financing and seed. Likewise  they need international rules against the flooding of their sales markets by subsidized agricultural products  as well as better access to the markets of industrialized countries.  A positive conclusion of the World Trade Organization (WTO) discussions could have been a positive sign of movement in this direction. Switzerland therefore regrets that it was not possible to reach agreement at the Ministerial Meeting held in Geneva in July. The challenge now is to ensure that the progress already made is not jeopardized and that confidence among WTO member States is restored  so that the Doha Round can be brought to a successful conclusion.  Climate change is another major source of concern. We in Switzerland are particularly aware of this fact because our alpine glaciers are rapidly melting away. In other parts of the world  this phenomenon takes the form of changing precipitation patterns  droughts and floods. The reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) clearly show that all these disasters have a point in common: they are the result of climate change and are caused by human beings  and particularly by the consumption of fossil fuels.  The time for never-ending talks has passed. Switzerland will achieve its emissions reduction goals for 2012. For the years after 2012  we need a new     08-53141 34  ambitious and internationally accepted climate regime. Such a regime should be based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. Switzerland has put forward a proposal for a global carbon dioxide tax which meets that criterion and would ensure the financing of the necessary adaptation measures. I would like to invite the Assembly to carefully study this proposal in the framework of the ongoing climate discussions.  The efforts of the industrialized countries alone will not be enough  however  to solve the problem of global warming. Each country will  according to its own capacities  have to contribute to the reduction of CO2 emissions. In so doing  we are united by a common concern: that of shouldering our responsibility to future generations.  Today  many countries are still in situations of armed conflict. In many cases  respect for international humanitarian law has declined. That is why Switzerland calls again on all conflicting parties to comply with the provisions of international humanitarian law and to guarantee humanitarian organizations swift and unhindered access to the victims of conflicts.  Conflict prevention is one of the central tasks of the United Nations. Switzerland is particularly active on two levels. First  we wish to pay closer attention to the connection between armed violence and development. Together with other partners  we intend to submit a draft resolution on this subject during this session of the General Assembly. Secondly  we strongly advocate the strengthening of the Secretariat’s mediation capacities. The mediation efforts in Kenya  for instance  have demonstrated that this form of conflict prevention can work.  That brings me to the subjects of the responsibility to protect and of prevention of genocide. Switzerland welcomes the fact that these subjects have been institutionally anchored more firmly within the United Nations.  The concept of the responsibility to protect was recognized in September 2005 in the framework of the World Summit. It is obvious that the operational implementation of the concept can only be realized progressively. Nevertheless  Switzerland will commit to ensuring that the concept is not partially assimilated into that of humanitarian intervention  thereby calling into question the consensus achieved in 2005.  Justice is necessary for building lasting peace. In other words  peace and impunity are incompatible in the long term. The arrest and extradition of Charles Taylor and Radovan Karadzic to The Hague have once again confirmed the importance of international criminal justice. Alleged war criminals must not be allowed to live in serenity. They must answer for their acts in a fair trial. That is the preventive effect of the international criminal justice system  and it should not be underestimated. Switzerland therefore supports the work of the International Criminal Court and advocates its independence.  At the beginning of my speech  I stressed the great importance of the United Nations. The world is changing  however  and international relations are constantly developing. The United Nations will also have to change. Those who focus only on the past will no doubt miss the future.  There is a need for reform in all United Nations bodies  but particularly in the Security Council. Given the power that it exerts  the expectations of the Security Council are very high. If its decisions are to be accepted and supported by the entire international community  the Council will need to adapt to the realities of the twenty-first century  namely  the new balances that characterize our world at the political  economic and demographic levels.  Moreover  it is important that the views of important actors that are not members of the Council should be better taken into account in decision-making. Switzerland has for some time advocated an improvement of the Council’s working methods and will continue to work for greater participation and transparency.  Peace is not a given. It is an ideal that has to be pursued every day. The United Nations is the predestined venue for achieving that goal. We are willing  within our capacities  to make our contribution to that pressing collective task. "
"32",1282,"CHL",63,2008,"On behalf of the General Assembly  I have the honour to welcome to the United Nations Her Excellency Mrs. Michelle Bachelet Jeria  President of the Republic of Chile  and to invite her to address the Assembly.   15 08-51749   President Bachelet Jeria (spoke in Spanish): Eight years ago  representatives of all the countries of the planet met in the General Assembly Hall to adopt the United Nations Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2) — a text that is one of the broadest and most explicit agreements ever drafted by the international community on the subject of development  well-being and quality of life. The Declaration set a series of very precise standards in the fight against hunger and poverty  education  health  gender equality  environment and cooperation  stating for each the minimum to which nations should commit themselves.   The world at that time announced the civilizing mission to which it aspired and identified the inescapable challenges and unavoidable tasks for any Government and for the international community. It defined a real ethical vision for the leaders of the nations. The world has changed since then  however.  We have witnessed  sometimes tragically  the emergence or reappearance of various problems of global significance  such as climate change  terrorism or the food crisis. At the same time  the interdependence of economies and communications has become even greater over the past eight years  which has undoubtedly created many opportunities but also greater risks and inequities.  In that changing context  we have witnessed outstanding progress towards the Millennium Development Goals in many countries of the world  but we have also witnessed many regrettable setbacks. World events over the past year give us much food for thought that will allow us to act decisively. The optimism of the turn of the century  leading to talk of the “millennium of hope”  seems to be dissipating. It is estimated that the increase in food prices alone has driven more than 100 million people into extreme poverty. In turn  financial instability today is afflicting many economies  threatening to generate a worldwide trend towards recession in which — as always — those most affected in the end will be the world’s poorest.  That is why it is so crucial to review our Goals. We cannot remain indifferent to the deterioration of the basic well-being of millions and millions of citizens all over the world. Those of us who share the same concept of progress and have made freedom and social justice our watchwords must raise our voices.  The world has managed to secure the economic  technical and scientific resources that  for the first time in its history  can ensure the well-being of all mankind. We cannot squander that capacity. A better world is possible  but it requires determination to move forward  and the current international economic crisis shows that it is precisely such determination that has been lacking.  The greed and irresponsibility of a few  combined with the political negligence of others  has plunged the world into a situation of great uncertainty. What a paradox we are witnessing today! With the money used to bail out the international banking system  the scourge of hunger on the planet could easily have been eliminated. Thus  now is the time to reaffirm our resolve.  The international economic crisis is a blow to those who believe that nothing can be done  that nothing should be regulated or that inequality cannot be remedied. That is the major lesson to be learned from what has happened over the past year. None of the current problems facing mankind  and certainly none of the civilizing goals that we have set ourselves  can be tackled properly if the public does not have a clear option of collective action by States and civil society.  That is why today I appeal to all to work together to support emergency measures to address the food crisis and to redouble our efforts to ensure that the developing economic crisis does not prevent us from attaining the Millennium Development Goals. That is why I appeal for an urgent and genuine commitment to multilateralism. That is why we must undertake to continue supporting and reforming international institutions  particularly the United Nations  to make them more representative  more democratic and more responsive to the hopes of our peoples.  That is also why we must reach agreement at the Doha Round of the World Trade Organization. That is why we must achieve concrete results at the forthcoming Follow-up International Conference on Financing for Development. That is why we must also ensure the success of the 2009 Copenhagen Climate Change Conference and convert those negotiations into agreements that make a decisive contribution to development.  I appear before this General Assembly as the representative of a nation that has much to contribute.    08-51749 16  Modestly and proudly  we announce to this Assembly that Chile is ahead of schedule towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals set for 2015. I emphasize that it is possible to eradicate poverty  that it is possible to emerge from underdevelopment and  even more importantly  that it is possible to do so in democracy and freedom.  My country almost tripled the size of its economy between 1990 and 2008  which are the years of democracy in Chile. Just as we have made the economy grow  we have also made social investment and equity grow. We have advanced strongly on all fronts: health  education  housing  quality of life  social cohesion and greater gender opportunities.  The numbers speak for themselves. At the end of the dictatorship  in 1989  4 out of every 10 Chileans were living in poverty. That 40 per cent dropped to 13 per cent in 2006. Although there is much to do  whenever we achieve one goal we set ourselves a new horizon of challenges. Just as we have drastically reduced poverty  today we aim to guarantee universal access for all Chileans to a social welfare system that allows them to live their lives in tranquillity and removes the fear of disease  poverty or old age  thus increasing opportunities for all  so as to advance steadily in greater equality and dignity.  However  this morning I wish to highlight the reasons for those achievements. What underlies them is a clear political determination  shared by the majority. The country has freely chosen a path of economic growth  political democracy and social justice. All political sectors have converged on that path  with differences  of course  as in any democracy  but all are aware that those are the major goals of Chilean society  because behind the achievements there is also a sad learning process.  In the past  when the country became divided  when the country became polarized in two irreconcilable factions  there was much suffering and very great social setbacks. Democracy placed at the centre of public life  as a goal for a freer and more just society  has been one of the main lessons that we Chileans have learned and that largely explains the achievements of the last 18 years.   That same conviction led us recently to be very active in coming to the aid of a friendly democracy. One week ago  when there was a threat to disrupt the democratic institutional order in the Republic of Bolivia  we nations of South America came to the support of the legitimately elected authorities and offered our cooperation to help in the resumption of the domestic political dialogue  while condemning the rebellion and bloodshed. Within a few days  we succeeded in convening a meeting of the Presidents of the member countries of the Union of South American Nations in Santiago de Chile  in order to agree with the President of Bolivia on a process for talks and to find and support a peaceful solution to the conflict in that country.   From this rostrum  as the convener of that historic regional meeting  I wish to express appreciation for the willingness displayed by all those involved  because we thereby set an example of how multilateral commitment should be understood. It is a commitment forged in the diversity of political projects but based on shared values  such as democracy  peace and the defence of human rights. The La Moneda summit — as that meeting was called  after the Chilean presidential palace — will forever symbolize the moment at which the South American nations decided to strengthen their commitment to democracy  whenever it is threatened anywhere on the continent.  Yet what does that episode tell us? It tells us that the values of democracy  dialogue  human rights and peace are becoming stronger than ever in Latin America. It tells us that the region wants to leave behind the dark moments of its history. It tells us that democracy is established as a system of government. It tells us that violence has no place in politics. And it tells us that those values  in addition to being widely shared by the citizens  are becoming entrenched in multilateralism  in institutions and in international law.  Over these years  we have learned that national policies  although essential  are not enough  that there is no incompatibility between affirmation of one’s own identity and integration  and that international agreements must be formulated to govern globalization and make democracy and the social rights of the citizens a universal requirement. Each country has the right and the duty to contribute to the creation of a world in which the great values of mankind prevail  regardless of the country’s economic or demographic dimension  of its influence or its power  or of how close it is to or how far it is from the hubs where decisions that affect the lives of each and every one of the planet’s inhabitants are taken.   17 08-51749   From our position at the south of the world  Chile is cooperating. We have enthusiastically supported  and in some cases promoted  the most diverse initiatives in pursuit of the development of our peoples. A few days ago  in Santiago de Chile  together with the Prime Minister of Norway  we launched an important regional initiative for the attainment of Millennium Development Goals 4 and 5 in Latin America and the Caribbean. Under that initiative  Chile will cooperate in the assignment and training of troops in Bolivia  Ecuador and other countries of the region. However  when we say “troops”  we are not talking about soldiers. It will be a force of nurses  midwives and doctors specialized in maternal and child health  who will travel through the fields and mountain ranges of our America  delivering babies  helping mothers  providing vaccinations and caring for sick children. Because despite the progress made in that regard in recent years  which has increased the percentage of attended births from 78 to 89 per cent  still 22 000 mothers die in Latin America each year simply because they received no professional care. Despite the improvement in child mortality  400 000 Latin American children under five years of age are still dying each year — hence  the urgency of that initiative  which is the urgency of promoting democracy and the social development of our people.  In just over two months  the world will have a noble reason for celebration. It will be the sixtieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. What a great step forward for mankind. That transcendental charter of rights marked the beginning of the end of centuries and centuries of arbitrary action  death  torture and abuse of power. Certainly that charter did not represent an immediate solution  but it did mean the beginning of the largest and most effective social and political mobilization in favour of people’s dignity.  Today  those who violate that charter sully their reputation with the international community. We have gone even further by creating an international architecture of protection and legal advancement  in which my region set a great precedent with the inter-American human rights protection system.  We hope that something similar will happen with the Millennium Declaration. We want it to become an ethical and political requirement for all the world’s rulers. We want the citizens of every country to protest against famine  poverty and unsanitary conditions. We want discrimination against women to be reason for shame for all those who practise it. We want discrimination against native peoples to be eliminated from the face of the Earth. We want protection of the environment to be part of the vocabulary of every inhabitant of the planet and  definitely  of the priorities of every Government in the world. We want cooperation by those who have the most to be a political as well as a moral obligation. That is Chile’s achievable desire  which we have come to present to this General Assembly."
"33",1328,"CHN",63,2008,"For China  this has been a special year. We experienced   35 08-51749  two major events. One was the devastating earthquake in Wenchuan  which caused grave loss of life and property. In the face of the disaster  the Chinese people showed great strength  courage  solidarity and resilience. By now  the people affected by the earthquake have been properly relocated and recovery and reconstruction work is well under way. The other event was the successful hosting of the Beijing Olympic Games. That grand sporting event provided a good opportunity for athletes from around the world to show true sportsmanship. It also enabled the world to learn more about China and for China to learn more about the world.   In our fight against the earthquake disaster and our efforts to host the Games  we received understanding  support and assistance from the international community. I wish to take this opportunity to express sincere gratitude on behalf of the Chinese Government and people.   Now the whole world wants to know in what direction China is heading  both politically and economically  after the Beijing Olympic Games. Let me tell you in unequivocal terms that China will remain committed to the path of peaceful development  unswervingly pursue reform and opening-up  and continue to adhere to an independent foreign policy of peace. This is in the fundamental interests of the Chinese people and the people of all other countries. It is also in keeping with the trend of the world.  The Olympic Games that just concluded were held in China  the largest developing country in the world. The international community has highly commended the efforts made by the Chinese Government and people for the Games  and their success has greatly inspired the Chinese people and given them even more confidence and strength to achieve modernization of the country.   At the same time  however  we are soberly aware that China is a country with 1.3 billion people. Although its total GDP is one of the highest in the world  it trails behind more than 100 countries in terms of per capita income. Development between urban and rural areas and among different regions in China is unbalanced. The rural areas  particularly in western China  are underdeveloped. Tens of millions of Chinese lack adequate food and clothing.   China is still a developing country  where productivity remains low and further development is constrained by the shortage of resources and energy and by environmental consequences. Our socialist market economic system  democracy and the rule of law need to be further improved  and certain outstanding social issues are yet to be resolved. To achieve China’s modernization is a daunting task  and we still have a long way to go. Both the opportunities and challenges that we face are unprecedented. We will seize the opportunities  rise up to challenges  dedicate ourselves to nation-building and focus on development. That is what the Chinese Government and people have been thinking and doing.  People may ask how China is achieving its development. The answer is through reform and opening up. This year marks the thirtieth anniversary of China’s reform and opening-up policy  a policy that fundamentally changed the closed  backward and ossified situation that had existed in China for years. It is a policy that freed people’s minds and aroused their initiative  liberated the productive forces  generated great economic and social progress and instilled vigour and vitality into the country. Without that policy  there would not have been such change in China in the last 30 years.   To achieve the goal of modernization and build a strong  prosperous  democratic  culturally advanced and harmonious country  we will pursue the reform and opening-up policy. It is of vital importance to the development of China today. It is also a strategy that will shape China’s future. We are firm in carrying this policy forward.  The Chinese nation has all along cherished the fine tradition and benefited from the wisdom of being open to new ideas and drawing on the strengths of others. The Chinese people have learned from 30 years of reform and opening up that only continued economic and political restructuring and reform in other fields can lead to sustained economic growth and social progress. And only continued opening up in an all-round way can lead the country to greater national strength and prosperity. This is the conclusion we have drawn both from our practice and exploration and from historical experiences.  The world needs peace  for only with peace can there be development. China earnestly hopes to have a peaceful international environment in order to achieve its development goals. The Chinese Government is committed to an independent foreign policy of peace    08-51749 36  and stands ready to work with other countries to advance the noble cause of the peace and progress of mankind.  Respect for sovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries is the prerequisite for sound State-to-State relations. The Chinese people have learned from their modern history of humiliation that when a country loses its sovereignty  its people lose dignity and status. China is firm in upholding its hard-won sovereignty and territorial integrity and will never tolerate any external interference. Following the principle of treating each other as equals  China also respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of other countries  as well as the independent choices of their people for their own social systems and development paths.  China is ready to develop friendly relations with all countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit rather than on ideology or on a political system. In handling international affairs  we make our own judgement on the merit of each case and take our position in light of our national interests and the well-being of the world’s people. We will neither blindly follow the position of others nor give way to the pressure of any forces. In international relations  China does not seek to build alliances or become a leader and will never do so in the future.  Peaceful settlement of international disputes is a founding purpose of the United Nations and a basic principle of international law. China is committed to addressing historical issues and current differences with other countries through dialogue and negotiation. As a permanent member of the Security Council  China will continue to play an active and constructive role in promoting the peaceful settlement of international hotspot issues and regional conflicts.  China’s development is peaceful in nature. It will not harm anyone or pose a threat to anyone. China does not seek hegemony now  nor will it do so in the future. China keeps and develops an appropriate level of military capability solely for the purpose of safeguarding China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.  The confidence and pride of the Chinese nation today are based on China’s economic development  social justice  the civility of its people and moral strength. China will  through its own development  contribute to the peace and development of the world.  In the long history of humankind  the destinies of countries have never been so closely linked as they are today. Given the global nature of issues threatening the survival and development of mankind  such as global warming  environmental degradation  resource constraints  frequent outbreaks of diseases and natural disasters and the spread of terrorism  and in the face of the intertwining challenges related to finance  energy and food  no country can expect to avoid difficulties or to handle the problems alone.   Ongoing financial volatility  in particular  has affected many countries  and its impact is likely to become more serious. To tackle the challenge  we must all make concerted efforts. So long as people of all countries  including their leaders  can do away with hostility  exclusion and prejudice  treat each other with sincerity and an open mind and forge ahead hand in hand  humankind will overcome all difficulties and embrace a brighter and better future.  China  as a responsible major developing country  is ready to work with other members of the international community to strengthen cooperation  share opportunities  meet challenges and contribute to the harmonious and sustainable development of the world.

"34",1362,"CIV",63,2008,"On behalf of my delegation  I would like to express my sincere congratulations to you  Sir  on your outstanding election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session. Your personal qualities  your in-depth knowledge of our Organization and your great experience in international affairs have enabled you to gather around you the support of the entire Assembly and certainly augur well for the success of your work. I also extend my congratulations to the members of your Bureau. Please be assured that our warmest wishes will accompany you throughout the session  which  under your leadership  is sure to be crowned with success.   29 08-53135   Allow me to pay fitting tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Srgjan Kerim  for his work as President.   I would also like to welcome Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and wish him every success as he attempts to accomplish his noble and lofty mission to consolidate and strengthen the role of the United Nations. My delegation and I assure him of our fullest cooperation and support as he seeks peaceful solutions to the problems of the world. I convey to the Secretary-General the deepest gratitude and the sincere thanks of His Excellency Mr. Laurent Gbagbo  President of the Republic of Côte d’Ivoire  and the Ivorian Government for his personal involvement in solving the crisis in my country. The Ivorian people still recall his historic visit of 23 and 24 April to Côte d’Ivoire. My country will continue to support him and  through him  the United Nations Operation in Côte d’Ivoire so that it may successfully accomplish its mission.  May I also express the thanks and gratitude of the Government and the people of Côte d’Ivoire to the international community  and in particular to the French Government  for their commitment and their efforts  through Operation Licorne  to restore peace in Côte d’Ivoire.   I take this opportunity once again to pay sincere tribute to the facilitator  Mr. Blaise Compaore  President of Burkina Faso and Chairman-in-Office of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)  for his untiring efforts on behalf of the peace process in Côte d’Ivoire  in particular in the framework of the follow-up mechanism of the Ouagadougou Political Agreement signed on 4 March 2007. My thanks also go to the heads of State of the African Union who spared no effort to resolve the crisis roiling Côte d’Ivoire since 19 September 2002.  I wish solemnly to reaffirm the determination of my country to emerge from the current crisis by organizing free  open and transparent elections. Attesting to our resolve was the launch on 15 September 2008  of the penultimate phase of the electoral process  which consists of identifying the voting population and individual voters.  The efforts of the international community to ensure the return of peace to Côte d’Ivoire — relying on regional organizations such as ECOWAS and the African Union  pursuant to President Gbagbo’s approach to resolving conflicts — are gradually bearing fruit and giving rise to improvements in the security situation throughout the country. For that reason  my country would be grateful if the United Nations could take into account the new situation and once again consider lowering its security index for Côte d’Ivoire.  In the same vein  my country would like to see the Security Council sanctions committee accede to its request  made on 26 September 2007 from this very rostrum  for the lifting of individual sanctions imposed on a number of Ivorian citizens. Allow me also  in the framework of the reorganization of the new Republican Army called upon to maintain public order and security  to appeal once again for the partial lifting of the arms embargo  as requested by President Laurent Gbagbo on that same occasion.  More than ever before  our Organization must show that it is able to maintain international peace and security throughout the world. In that context  as was indicated by President Laurent Gbagbo at the high-level debate on the relationship between the United Nations and regional organizations  this universal Organization must open broad new avenues for peace in the world. Indeed  the United Nations  as an instrument prepared at the end of the Second World War to guarantee international peace  is no longer adapted to the current world. Therefore  as wished by a number of Member States  the reform of the United Nations is necessary  and we must clarify its goals and its missions.   That is why my delegation feels that  after years of work and reflection on United Nations reform  the time has now come to bring the process to a close. Unfortunately  with regard to the reform of the Security Council  although there may be a consensus on the need to increase the number of members of the Council in order to make it more broadly representative  there are still differences with regard to its composition  the extension of the right of veto to potential new permanent members  and the improvement of its working methods. In that respect  my country reaffirms its adherence to the African Common Position on that matter.   The persistent search for peace will be in vain if we do not bring greater justice to international economic relations. In other words  there will be no genuine peace so long as intolerable differences remain in the living conditions between various population    08-53135 30  groups  on one hand  and between developed and developing countries  on the other.   In that respect  I welcome the efforts undertaken by a number of countries to promote economic cooperation between them and the countries of Africa. Examples include cooperation with the European countries through the European Union; with Japan through the Tokyo International Conference on African Development; with China through the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation; with the United States through the African Growth and Opportunity Act; and with India and Turkey through their respective partnerships.  Economic globalization was meant to open new horizons for international cooperation  but overall it has not been beneficial to developing countries because of the fragile nature of their economic structures. It would therefore be an illusion to imagine that market forces alone can help the development of the poorest countries. We must therefore regulate trade by adopting rules agreed at the global level  because only a fair international trade system can contribute to the expansion of underdeveloped economies.   In that respect  my delegation deplores the failure in July of World Trade Organization negotiations that should have breathed new life into international cooperation and created conditions for developing countries to benefit from globalization through trade and investment.  The issue of debt remains a cause for concern to a number of developing countries. That is why I would like to welcome all the praiseworthy initiatives undertaken to alleviate its effects on the economies of those countries.   The recent food crisis  whose devastating effects are being felt in several countries  requires the international community to go beyond mere promises and to act together  taking specific innovative and courageous actions and measures that can  above all  bring hope to the situation and find a global response to a problem that has become global.  In that regard  I welcome the establishment by the Secretary-General of the High-Level Task Force on the Global Food Security Crisis and the efforts of developing countries to come to the rescue of those in their countries who have been the most seriously affected by the food crisis.   My country also welcomes the implementation of the Centres of Excellence project carried out by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  aimed at strengthening South-South cooperation scientific research in the agricultural field. With that in mind  President Laurent Gbagbo recommends the creation of a solidarity-based mechanism through which exporting countries would provide food to importing countries and the establishment of a United Nations food stabilization fund.  The energy crisis being felt throughout the world  in addition to its negative effects  is demonstrating once again the fragility of the economies of a large number of countries. Although the development of biofuels seems to be a good alternative to fossil fuels — which  much to our consternation  are running out — we must also ensure that their production is not carried out to the detriment of agriculture  the main purpose of which is to feed the people of the world. That is why  in the interest of current and future generations  we must think carefully and deeply about the adoption and development of new  renewable sources of energy.  With regard to all of the crises and difficulties that humanity is facing  now more than ever before the international community must translate into action the idea of solidarity and cooperation  as contained in the Charter of the United Nations  in order to restore credibility to the Organization. Such solidarity should be demonstrated first and foremost by the implementation of the commitments undertaken by the industrialized countries to devote at least 0.7 per cent of their gross national income to official development assistance.   To that end  I would like to welcome all initiatives aimed at helping developing countries in general  and African countries in particular  to overcome their current economic situation. The diligent implementation of the New Partnership for Africa’s Development  the main goal of which is to fight poverty  is part of such an approach. It is on that note of hope that my delegation calls on the international community to seek solutions to current challenges in a United Nations that is more democratic and that responds to each and every one of its Members. "
"35",1405,"CMR",63,2008,"I should like at the outset to welcome the fact that Nicaragua  represented by Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann  is presiding over the General Assembly at its sixty-third session. Cameroon wishes him every success in carrying out his mission and assures him of its full cooperation. I wish also to pay a well-deserved tribute to Ambassador Kerim for the skill with which he led the work of the Assembly at its sixty-second session. Finally  I congratulate His Excellency Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon  and reiterate our appreciation and support for his remarkable efforts in discharging his lofty mission.  By proposing the impact of the global food crisis on poverty and hunger in the world and the need to democratize the United Nations as main themes of the general debate at the sixty-third session  the President focused our deliberations on core problems currently faced by the international community. I support this proposal all the more because Cameroon  like other countries throughout the world  has recently experienced social upheaval caused by the increasingly high cost of living.  As a result  we decided on and implemented a series of corrective measures  ranging from a reduction of taxes and customs duties on certain basic commodities to an increase in the salaries of State employees and measures to stabilize fuel prices. Those measures were lauded by the International Monetary Fund and undoubtedly had very positive effects. They did not  however  totally eliminate a problem of global proportions and one which requires global responses. The food crisis  which is one manifestation  has taken on alarming proportions throughout the world. All economies  irrespective of size  but particularly those of poor countries  are seriously affected. The most vulnerable populations are forced to forego health care and education just to feed themselves.  If appropriate responses are not found rapidly  there will be reason to fear dramatic repercussions on international trade  economic growth  social progress  political stability and  hence  global security. There is therefore an urgent necessity to act rapidly and collectively. We believe an appropriate response to the situation lies in ensuring coordination at the highest level. That is why I welcome the fact that the Secretary-General took the initiative to establish the High-Level Task Force on the Global Food Security Crisis  whose aim is to promote a coherent and unified    08-51851 14  response to the crisis. Cameroon shares the vision contained in the Comprehensive Framework for Action prepared by the Task Force.  We are of the view that a lasting solution to the crisis requires short- and medium-term actions  including increased food aid and investment in agriculture  the promotion of social welfare initiatives  reduction of agricultural subsidies in developed countries and restrictions on food exports from countries of the South. It is obvious that such solutions cannot be implemented without the participation of all and without the establishment of global food and agriculture partnerships involving all stakeholders  namely Governments  the private sector  civil society  donors and international institutions.  At a time when the midterm assessment of the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals is under way  the global food crisis appears as one of the major challenges the international community will have to face. In that regard  Cameroon wishes to join its voice to that of the Secretary-General in appealing for financing of the measures recommended by the Task Force. But  however acute the food crisis may be  it is far from being the only snag in the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals.   Concerning Africa in particular  there are many other challenges  such as persistent poverty  peace and security issues and the effects of climate change. Concerning poverty alleviation  our continent placed much hope in globalization which it supported in good faith  despite legitimate fears concerning the globalization of trade. It should be acknowledged that  on the whole  these hopes were dashed.   Beyond the global food crisis  it is obvious that Africa has felt the negative effects of the international financial crisis and the exponential oil price hikes: phenomena well beyond its control. In addition  it helplessly watched the erosion of official development assistance and the failure of the Doha Round negotiations  where its interests were relegated to the background. This role of powerless onlooker can only lead to deep frustration and cast doubts on the chances of achieving the Millennium Development Goals within the set time frames.  Nevertheless  Africa wants to believe that the international community will not give up assisting it to emerge from poverty and underdevelopment. For that reason  we fully appreciate the initiative of the United Nations to organize high-level meetings devoted to the development of our continent  on the sidelines of this session. On the economic front  Africa’s immense potential remains largely untapped  and  although many African countries have been recording good economic performance  the continent remains the poorest on the planet. Hence the need for increased solidarity of the international community.  The growing impact of climate change  especially in Africa  is particularly disturbing; more than elsewhere  it affects areas on which the fate of future generations depends. There is thus an urgent need for joint action by the international community.  Such solidarity should also prevail when addressing the issue of migrants. The tragedies they experience are  to put it bluntly  inhuman. The atrocities and acts of discrimination they endure on a daily basis are intolerable. There is urgent need to jointly seek solutions to manage this exodus which drains Africa of the human resources it greatly needs. There is no gainsaying that the economic development of the continent is the one and only solution to that painful problem.  As regards peace and security  perhaps more than in any other area  Africa needs the active solidarity of the international community. There is reason to be satisfied with the progress made in several countries that were hitherto plagued by deadly confrontations  though it should be acknowledged that many hotbeds of tension and conflict still exist on the continent.   Here  the peace agreements signed after lengthy negotiations are yet to enter fully into force. There  force is used to jeopardize democratic achievements. Continuing confrontations in Somalia  the chronic instability along the borders of Chad  the Central African Republic and the Sudan  the daily tragedy faced by the population of Darfur and the recurrent eruption of violence in the east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Burundi are all cause for serious concern.  Unfortunately  nor is our continent spared the threat of terrorism  which now has a global dimension. I am convinced that only global and resolute action will help address that issue. Cameroon will contribute its support as necessary.  The international community  and in particular the United Nations  are making commendable efforts to   15 08-51851  promote peace in Africa. That is why the Organization must receive from all its Members the resources that it needs to ensure the effectiveness of its action. To that end  it should constantly express the common will and continue to be the crucible of the democratization of international relations.  The historic achievement recorded in the settlement of the dispute over the Bakassi peninsula is one of the best examples of the remarkable results that can be generated by an authentic desire for peace shared by the parties  with the judicious support of the international community.  The ceremony in Calabar on 14 August 2008  which marked the withdrawal of the Nigerian administration and police force from Bakassi and the transfer of authority to Cameroon  was undoubtedly the result of the commitment to peace shown by the leaders and peoples of both countries. In that regard  I wish to express my profound gratitude to friendly countries for the support they have continued to give to the implementation of the ruling of the International Court of Justice and to the Greentree Agreement. I wish to thank in particular the States witness to the Agreement  namely  the United States of America  France  the Federal Republic of Germany and the United Kingdom.  The United Nations also played a decisive role in the settlement of that matter. The tireless efforts of Secretaries-General Kofi Annan and Ban Ki-moon and their representatives within the Mixed Commission deserve our gratitude.  Thus dawned a new era in relations between Cameroon and Nigeria  geared towards the quest for progress and development to which our two peoples aspire. It goes without saying that the two countries must henceforth do everything possible to consolidate the settlement and seize the opportunities offered to them to develop their relations in all areas. In that regard  I wish to reaffirm that Cameroon will respect all its commitments.  The delay in the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals must spur us to redouble our efforts to carry out vigorous  joint and mutually supportive actions in fighting against poverty and for development.  The Government of Cameroon is resolutely committed to that end. I wish to pay homage to our population for the sacrifices they have made in that respect  as well as to our bilateral and multilateral partners for the multifaceted assistance they are providing to us. That assistance is invaluable to us  particularly in our efforts to promote better management of public resources. Within that framework we have launched a fierce fight against dishonest managers  which we intend to pursue ruthlessly.  Guided by a concern to improve the well-being of our people  we reaffirm from this rostrum our determination relentlessly to pursue our efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. To perform that task successfully  we know that we can count on the understanding and support of the United Nations. "
"36",1449,"COD",63,2008,"I wish at the outset to discharge the pleasant duty of conveying to you  Sir  the message of His Excellency  Mr. Joseph Kabila Kabange  President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo  who is unable to attend and therefore asked me to convey to you his sincerest congratulations on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session. He has no doubt that your great experience  enriched by your skills and knowledge  will allow you to fulfil the heavy responsibility that has been entrusted to you  to the satisfaction of all.  I should also like to pay tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Srgjan Kerim  and congratulate him on the dedication and skill with which he fulfilled his mandate. Finally  I should like to pay due homage to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon  whose reforming efforts  commitment and energy have enhanced the role of the United Nations and made it more credible to Member States and to international public opinion.  This session is opening at a particularly difficult moment for humanity. The international financial crisis  the sharp rises in the cost of food  energy and fuel  and the effects of climate change are weakening economies throughout the world  particularly those of the developing countries. They are a threat to international peace and stability and therefore represent a major challenge to which the community of nations must respond in a concerted  decisive and tangible way.  With regard in particular to the global food crisis and the sharp rise in food prices  the Democratic Republic of Congo calls for new  innovative and urgent action to be taken beyond the recommendations made at the Rome Summit. We also endorse the appeal for the mobilization of the resources necessary for the World Food Programme to implement its strategic plan and achieve its priority mission. We are firmly convinced that human intelligence  which makes all scientific progress possible  should also allow us to eliminate hunger throughout the world  provided that we do so at the global level and that all States demonstrate the necessary political will. It is on the basis of that belief that the member countries of the Economic Community of Central African States held a regional meeting in Kinshasa in July in order to rise to the challenge posed to our subregion by the food crisis and the sharp rise in food costs. We made a frank diagnosis  and concrete and urgent measures were taken. The Democratic Republic of the Congo is determined to make an active contribution towards implementing those measures.   Similarly  the United Nations environmental conventions that the Democratic Republic of the Congo ratified include the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification  the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity and the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer.  Home to 60 per cent of the forests of the Congo basin  the Democratic Republic of the Congo is aware of the crucial role that it can play in controlling the global climate. It intends to assume that role in a fully responsible way  provided that the international community provides in exchange fair remuneration for the environmental goods and services that are provided by the forests of Congo to all humankind.   45 08-53141   The fact that the different crises are affecting — though perhaps in different ways — all countries throughout the world without exception clearly demonstrates the futility of any claim to protective isolation. On the other hand  it demonstrates the common destiny of all humans and the justification for the dialogue of religions  cultures and civilizations  each of which must be protected and respected as an integral and irreplaceable part of the human heritage. We therefore commend the maturity of those States that have apologized or expressed regrets  and even offered compensation for the harm caused to others by slavery  colonization  aggressive behaviour or violations of fundamental human rights and the rights of peoples. That will leave in the collective universal memory an indelible testimony to those who  in the name of a transitory supremacy that scorned the true basic nature of the world  claimed eternal superiority and at one point in history claimed to have a lasting moral right over weaker people.  With the promise of a great future but weakened by years of bad government and war  the Democratic Republic of the Congo  thanks to the confidence of its people and the sustained support of the international community  has risen again as a State  a republic and a democracy. Indeed  following the success of our reunification and pacification efforts  and after exemplary presidential  legislative and provincial elections  the legitimate new authorities of our country launched a programme of reconstruction and are now ready to organize urban  municipal and local elections in order to allow the people to choose their own local representatives responsible for everyday affairs.  The improvement  however  needs to be shored up urgently  because two territories in North Kivu  out of the 142 that make up the Republic  are still the scene of a dangerous security situation that could undermine all the investments that have been made towards the rebirth of the country. In fact  because of one of the national armed groups  the Congrès national pour la défense du peuple (CNDP)  it has not yet been possible to enjoy the full benefits of the AMANI Forum — “Amani” means peace in Swahili — to implement the act of engagement signed at the Conference on Peace  Security and Development for the provinces of North and South Kivu  held in Goma from 6 to 25 January 2008 at the initiative of the Head of State. On the contrary  fighting has broken out again  which has created a massive displacement of populations and led to renewed violations of human rights.  With regard to the Nairobi communiqué  which was the basis for resolving the problem of the harmful presence in the same region of the country of armed elements from the Forces démocratiques de libération du Rwanda (FDLR). That group continues to sow death and destruction despite the progress that has been made elsewhere. That progress includes  first  the organization of information and awareness-raising programmes for armed Rwandan groups in order to ensure their voluntary participation in disarmament followed by their return to Rwanda  their country of origin  if they so wish  or to relocate them far from the border between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda  or outside Congolese territory; secondly  the cantonment  disarmament and voluntary repatriation to Rwanda of several dozen FDLR elements and their dependants; and  finally  the deployment of special brigades of the Forces armíes de la Republique démocratique du Congo  who will work with the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) to compel  if necessary  reluctant FDLR elements to accept the disarmament  demobilization  reintegration and resettlement or repatriation programme and to curtail their movements.  In the face of a resurgence in violence  the Head of State has taken the initiative once again by reasserting the Government’s support for the Goma act of engagement and the AMANI Forum as the best way to put an end to the presence of armed groups in North and South Kivu and for the Nairobi communiqué to resolve the problem of the FDLR. Under his initiatives  a disengagement plan drawn up by MONUC has been adopted and a verification and monitoring mechanism is being developed. Accepted by the Government and the armed groups  with the exception of the CNDP  the plan will come into force on 1 October and end 45 days later.  The Democratic Republic of the Congo calls upon the Security Council to support the plan and provide MONUC with a clear mandate and adequate resources in order  if necessary  to impose peace and security in that part of the Congolese territory. The credibility of the United Nations and its peacekeeping missions — of which that in the Congo is by far the largest — are at stake.    08-53141 46   The human conscience cannot tolerate and the people of Congo cannot understand how  despite having leaders legitimately elected by the people and who enjoy international recognition  a small group should be allowed to maintain a perpetual rebellion  entailing the rape of women and the loss of human life on a massive scale. In the face of the tragedy in the eastern Congo  MONUC should be authorized to act and be able to act convincingly. It is our firm belief that there could be no more legitimate use of force or timely exercise of the United Nations moral authority.  In addition to the efforts made to eliminate insecurity in the East of our country  the Democratic Republic of the Congo is seeking to strengthen the rule of law  consolidate democracy and ensure good governance. Justice is therefore one of the pillars of our policy. For approximately 10 years now  our country has witnessed millions of deaths  the direct or indirect victims of armed conflicts. Entire families have been wiped out  mass graves abound  and violence against women has reached unprecedented levels. The country is trying to remedy the situation. For that reason  we supported Security Council resolution 1820 (2008) on women and peace and security  and we thank the Secretary-General for having placed the suffering of the women and girls of the Congo high on his agenda and for the support he has given us in that regard.  What we need most of all  however  and what the people of the Congo ardently desire and which we are duty-bound to guarantee to them is the right to justice. That means neither more nor less than putting an end to impunity. How can we prevent recidivism and copycat offences if  thanks to political horse-trading  criminals are not prosecuted? How can we put an end to the rape of women and girls and other massive violations of human rights if the warlords are exempt from legal prosecution because of their military strength or capacity for doing great harm? The logic of civilized society is specifically intended to counter the law of force with the force of the law.  In the Democratic Republic of the Congo  we have experienced the unique role that justice plays as a factor for national harmony and reconciliation  peace  security and stability. It is thanks to justice that we have been able to bring lasting peace to Ituri and North Katanga. It is with the support of justice that we intend to restore peace throughout our country. It will be national justice preferably  international justice if necessary  but justice in any case is a fundamental requirement. It is in that context that we must place efforts to rehabilitate the national judicial system  and it is in the same framework that we are cooperating with the International Criminal Court.  The Democratic Republic of the Congo is also doing its very best to meet the fundamental needs of its people in the areas of healthcare  education  self-sufficiency in food  basic infrastructure  electricity  drinking water for all and  of course  efforts to counteract HIV/AIDS  malaria and  above all poverty. Five pillars have been established to that end. They involve infrastructure  employment  housing  education and health  and water and electricity. The complexity of those areas in a country as large as ours justifies the scope of the contributions we seek. The Democratic Republic of the Congo is therefore open to any partner that can help us meet the challenges of reconstruction and development.  All peoples of the world aspire to peace; hence the need for international and regional mechanisms and instruments for peacekeeping and conflict prevention and settlement. Therefore  the Democratic Republic of the Congo welcomes the fact that the Secretary-General has accepted our request to establish a United Nations Peacebuilding Office for Central Africa. We are convinced that the Office will promote greater closeness and coordination between the United Nations and the countries of the region. The issues of peace  security  humanitarian aid and development will be considered expeditiously and treated with the urgency that they merit.  In more global terms  we continue to support the efforts of the Organization in its various efforts to promote peace  security  human rights  gender equality and development. In that context  we call for accelerated reform of the United Nations and the Security Council  because achieving our dreams in the face of current and future challenges depends on it. The United Nations must change and adapt itself to meeting the new challenges of armed conflict  globalization  the lack of financial resources adequate to the breadth of its missions  pandemics  terrorism  and the need to buttress the system of collective security  particularly by enlarging the number of decision-makers in terms of international peace and security and by ensuring a more balanced and fair representation of the world in the Security Council. That is an indispensable democratic requirement for the proper and effective   47 08-53141  functioning of the United Nations system. In that regard  the African continent should be represented as a permanent member of the Security Council.  Furthermore  the need for Security Council reform should not obscure the need to review other bodies of the United Nations system  particularly the Economic and Social Council and the Secretariat. The same applies to the working methods of the other councils and the International Court of Justice  which need to be revised  while their interaction with bodies yet to be created must be better identified and delineated. Similarly  efforts to revitalize the work of the General Assembly should continue and its authority strengthened in order to allow its President to play a key role in finding solutions to international problems.  It is said that nature only poses threats to humankind that its creativity is capable of addressing. Despite our differences  the time has come to put our individual imaginations together to ensure that the keys of the global economy are not left to out-and-out capitalism. We should instead use the universal values of justice  solidarity and altruism to promote peace and international security. We believe that  together  we can provide a better future for humanity so long as we work every day to achieve the ideals of our universal organization.  I wish every success to this sixty-third session of the General Assembly. "
"37",1496,"COG",63,2008,"My delegation welcomes your inspired election  Sir  to the presidency of the General Assembly at this session  which is being held at a particularly important moment in the life of our Organization  given the numerous challenges that we have to face. The robust messages that you yourself have issued here clearly indicate that you are fully aware of the magnitude of what is at stake. As is so well suggested by the Secretary-General in his report on the activities of the Organization (A/63/1)  more than ever before the world’s problems require concerted and coordinated actions.  We commend the Secretary-General on the resolute action that he has undertaken since the beginning of his mandate. We highly appreciate his dynamism  his realism and the increasing interest that he brings to matters of peace  security and sustainable development.  His Excellency Mr. Denis Sassou Nguesso  President of the Republic of the Congo  who was unable personally to attend this general debate  has instructed me to share with the members of the Assembly a few thoughts on developments in our world.  The challenges that we have to tackle immediately are numerous. They are related to peace  security  and threats to people’s lives and to nations  heightened by the food  energy and financial crises  as well as natural disasters and climate change.  By placing emphasis on the notion of solidarity  which we fully support  you have certainly illustrated  Mr. President  the risk we run of losing our identity  an option that can only offer partial  even uncertain  solutions to the challenges that confront us. Here  we reaffirm that the United Nations offers us the ideal framework to work together in search of lasting solutions. That is the meaning underlying our ongoing attachment to multilateralism.  Recent events in different parts of the world  particularly in Europe  remind us that peace and security rest on a fragile foundation  even where such matters seem to have been solved definitively. Africa  still at the heart of the concerns of the international community and top of the agenda of the Security Council because of the conflicts that continue to jeopardize progress and to hinder implementation of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  will not solve its problems with declarations of good intentions.  The high-level meeting on Africa’s needs that was held on 22 September revealed that it is time to move from promises to sustainable action. That is why we welcome the adoption of the declaration that marked that important event. Similarly  we salute the high-level meeting for the MDGs that concluded here on 25 September.   As we all know  the stabilization of the situation in countries in conflict and the building of peace in others would not have been possible without the sustained efforts of the United Nations and other bilateral and multilateral partners. The African Union and subregional African organizations continue to act resolutely and often with limited resources to meet those challenges. Thanks to all such efforts  the Central African Republic  to cite the example of our neighbouring country  is working to restore peace and security through dialogue among the Government  the opposition and rebel movements.  Still with respect to our subregion of Central Africa  we call on the international community to step up its efforts to help stabilize the situation in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo  particularly by supporting the Government of that country in its fight against rebel movements and other negative forces. In that context  the entry into force in June of the Pact on Security  Stability and Development in the Great Lakes Region will usher in a new climate of confidence in that nerve centre of our continent. My Government is committed to fully playing its role in that process  which will greatly contribute to stabilizing to the situation.  With regard to the crisis between Chad and the Sudan  we encourage those two countries to pursue every effort to normalize their relations and consolidate peace in the region. In that regard  we welcome the resumption of diplomatic relations between the two countries — an initiative that must be consolidated through the establishment of military monitoring units along the common border. Those units need to be adequately equipped  in implementation of the Dakar Agreement signed in March 2008.  As African Union co-mediator with Libya in that crisis  Congo will spare no effort in helping to bring those two brotherly countries to respect the engagements undertaken and to act always in good faith in order to establish a definitive peace between and around them.   27 08-53135   Solving the conflict in Darfur would contribute largely to that end. That is why we make an urgent appeal for the effective deployment of the troops of the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID)  which should be supplied with all necessary equipment to become operational and efficient.  For its part  my country recently completed the preparatory phase for a police unit composed of 140 personnel that is now at the disposal of UNAMID. However  the international community should also work tirelessly to implement of the Abuja Agreement on Darfur. Non-signatories who are violating that Agreement must be strongly pressured to return to the negotiating table. In that context  we believe that it is counterproductive to carry out the indictment against the Head of State of the Sudan.  With respect to Africa yet again  we welcome the settlement of the crisis in Kenya and the process of reconciliation in Zimbabwe  and call on African political actors in power and in opposition to respect the verdict of the ballot box.  In its desire to participate in the collective effort in the area of peace and security  my country reaffirms its full commitment to the fight against terrorism  the proliferation of small arms and light weapons  drug trafficking and human trafficking. Congo remains fully committed to strict compliance with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in all its facets.  Congo calls on the international community to consider as a matter of urgency the resolution of the Middle East conflict on the basis of commitments already undertaken  particularly the road map of the Quartet and the Arab peace initiative.   Our commitment to multilateralism leads us to believe that there is a pressing need to pursue the work of United Nations reform  and particularly that of the Security Council. In keeping with the African position on that issue  my country welcomes the decision to launch  before 31 January 2009  intergovernmental negotiations that should finally enable that matter to genuinely move forward.  It is right that our present agenda includes the matter of the effects of climate change on the environment  which is one of the major challenges of our times. My country is particularly sensitive to that issue since it has within its borders a part of the enormous Congo basin  the world’s second ecological lung after Amazonia. The countries bordering the basin have a great responsibility to humanity in the management and sustainable exploitation of these ecosystems  which they are shouldering in a determined and encouraging manner.  While endorsing the conclusions of last year’s Bali Conference  which laid the groundwork for the post-Kyoto period  the States of the Congo basin believe that global policies on the preservation of forest equilibriums should establish compensation mechanisms. Those would include the creation of substitute economies to benefit the populations in the areas involved.  In expressing those concerns  I take the opportunity to announce that Congo will host in Brazzaville  from 27 to 30 October 2008  the sixth World Forum on Sustainable Development  devoted to assessing the progress achieved in the implementation of Agenda 21 and the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation  particularly concerning strategic  credible and pertinent partnerships towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals.  On the economic and social front  we welcome the focus at this session on sustainable development and implementation of the Millennium Development Goals. The analyses carried out here last week indicate that African States have made significant progress  with a rate of growth of approximately 6 per cent per annum  and that  as emphasized in the Secretary-General’s report  Africa is resolutely on the right path and should continue to pursue those commendable efforts  particularly since it varies between countries and regions.  Nevertheless  such efforts and the promising outcomes they may yield require genuine  continuous and tangible international support. That is why our partners must keep their promises.  The current Chair of the African Union  President Kikwete of the United Republic of Tanzania  brilliantly described to the Assembly the situation in our continent and indicated the way forward. We fully endorse the presentation he made here and on other occasions. We welcome the different partnerships that Africa has established with its traditional friends and with new ones. Here once again  the commitments need to be brought to fruition.    08-53135 28   Our continent is resolutely committed to the battle for progress  which has several facets. That is why we attach great importance to matters of democracy  good governance and respect for human rights in the framework of the African Peer Review Mechanism  a pillar of the New Partnership for Africa’s Development. Several African countries have agreed to submit to periodic evaluations that represent a sort of right to positive interference in the affairs of other member States in matters that normally fall under national jurisdiction. Congo has voluntarily subscribed to the process  illustrating Africa’s devotion to the fight against bad governance  corruption  human rights violations and impunity.  It is therefore inconceivable that certain foreign judges should confer upon themselves the right to drag African leaders to their national courts in the name of the principle of universal jurisdiction — a rule that seems to be applied exclusively to Africa since  as we have already seen  the same principle was soon dropped when it targeted leaders of powerful States. It is regrettable that international jurisdiction  while remaining respectable  seems to be following a path of judiciary spite against African leaders.  In that regard  Africa has become an experimentation ground for dangerous and even hateful practices. The sad memories of such other negative experiences as slavery  the slave trade and colonization are enough for us. President Kikwete was right to raise this issue here  in application of a decision taken during the summit of the African Union held in Sharma el-Sheikh in Egypt.  The Republic of the Congo had a particularly rough patch in the 1990s and managed  thanks to the political will of the Government  all political actors and the civil society  to achieve national reconciliation. That climate of peace made possible the organization of legislative elections in 2007 and municipal and local elections in 2008 in an atmosphere of calm and serenity  despite irregularities identified during the voting process. Nevertheless  the transparency and credibility of the process were not disputed by the international observers.  With the irregularities corrected  it is in the same climate of calm and serenity that we are organizing the 2009 presidential election  in accordance with our Constitution. The climate of restored peace has led to an increasingly reassuring economic situation that is supported by improved budgetary planning and better debt management within the framework of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative and the rigorous measures that today have enabled Congo to focus more ambitiously on its development and on the progressive achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. Within that framework and in a participatory manner  with the assistance of the United Nations Development Programme  we drafted a poverty reduction strategy paper that was approved by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.  By way of illustration  the principle measures taken towards the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals in the sensitive areas of education and health care focus on from free access to education and textbooks  the establishment of a drug purchase centre  the distribution of treated mosquito nets to the population  and free access to HIV/AIDS testing  checkups and anti-retroviral medication.  Such efforts  however encouraging they may be  can bear fruit in the long run only with the support of external partners and in a favourable international context as regards such thorny issues as debt  trade  official development assistance  financing for development and  above all  international peace and security.  Members may now easily understand why a modest member of the international community such as Congo is so deeply invested in the existence and the work of our collective home  the United Nations. "
"38",1543,"COL",63,2008,"Speaking once again before the General Assembly  I would like to congratulate you on your election  Mr. President  and to wish you every success.  Colombia continues to fight so that each and every citizen can trust that he or she will live  work  undertake projects  study and be happy in his or her homeland. That trust is sustained by democratic security  security for socially responsible investment and the construction of social cohesion.  Crimes against the safety of citizens continue to decrease  but we are not satisfied. So far this year  the number of crimes has fallen by 30 per cent in comparison to the same period last year. We have prioritized the protection of union leaders  teachers and journalists. Of the 11 204 homicides committed as of 10 September  36 were of workers and teachers affiliated with trade unions or independent teachers. To date  not a single journalist has been murdered. The Government grants individual protection to 8 612 citizens  1 462 of whom belong to trade unions.  Our determination to combat impunity is ongoing. Between 1991 and 2001  only two convictions were handed down. Thanks to efforts in recent years in terms of budgeting  the strengthening of the judicial system  the security policy and the tripartite agreement among workers  business leaders and the Government  sponsored by the International Labour Organization  199 persons have been convicted for the murder of workers and 134 of them are in prison. Of the 123 sentences handed down  85 have occurred in the past three years.  In the past  terrorist organizations penetrated the labour movement  resulting in the murder of workers. The dismantling of the paramilitaries has eliminated that source of suffering  but terrorist guerrillas persist in committing such crimes  as recently happened in the south of the country with the murder of a group of teachers by the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia-Ejército del Pueblo (FARC).  Recently  our tranquillity in the absence of terrorist attacks was shattered by a car bomb set off by FARC  which destroyed the palace of justice in the city of Cali and left several people dead and others injured  as well as many poor families with their small businesses and homes destroyed.  Of the approximately 60 000 terrorists that ravaged the country at the start of the Government’s term of office  48 000 have abandoned their criminal organizations and joined the reintegration programme  which is a great challenge for Colombia. As of    08-51839 14  17 September this year  2 436 guerrilla members —2 147 of them from FARC — had been demobilized.  In a democracy of opinion such as ours  the sustainability of democratic security depends on its credibility  which in turn is based on effectiveness and transparency. That transparency is tantamount to the observance of the fundamental human rights we all enjoy. From that foundation comes our respect for liberties in the midst of the fight against terrorism and for openness  vigilance  criticism and debate at the national and international levels.  Furthermore  a formative  world-leading effort in human rights within our armed forces is crucial  as is the ongoing adjustment of operative protocols through such measures as that requiring soldiers to wait for the presence of a judicial delegate before moving the body of a member of a criminal organization killed in action. We are also resolved to investigate and assist in the investigation of any type of accusation and the modernization of military criminal legislation.  On 10 December  our country will voluntarily submit our human rights record to the Universal Periodic Review  a new mechanism created by the United Nations that is an additional contribution to the public discussion of our new road map on the matter. Our work with the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and with the Organization of American States on the policy of truth  justice and redress for victims must  along with our historic memory  heal wounds and help to extinguish the flames of violence forever.  There are intangible results of democratic security. Citizens have greater faith in the State and turn to it for protection  overcoming the past indifference of some and the inclination of many to solve problems by their own means. Additionally  we have recovered the State monopoly on weapons and on official justice. Citizens have lost their fear of denouncing others  testifying and cooperating with the armed forces and the justice system. Victims are no longer fearful and today are coming forward to claim their rights.  One year ago  I looked out at this Assembly in the frustration of not having been able to rescue Ingrid Betancourt and those held in captivity with her. Today  thanks to the heroism  planning and bloodless effectiveness of our soldiers  Ingrid Betancourt is a symbol of freedom — the freedom to which we aspire as we liberate those who remain in captivity and put an end to such shameful crimes in our homeland.  Social cohesion validates security. Meeting the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) set for 2015 is an urgent need for us as an essential part of building social cohesion. We are close to reaching the goal of no more than 3 per cent of children under the age of five being malnourished. We are determined to reach zero and are now beginning to provide early schooling to those children.  By 2010  we hope to have reached 100 per cent in basic education coverage. Towards the goal of averaging 10.6 years of education for the population between ages 15 and 24  we have already achieved an average of more than nine years. The number of students having to repeat a grade has decreased from 6.1 per cent to 3.3 per cent  towards a goal of  2.3 per cent.  Mortality rates for children under five years of age have fallen from 37 to 20 per 1 000 births  with a goal of 17. That same indicator for children younger than one year has decreased from 31 to 15.6  with a goal of 14. Vaccination coverage is almost at 95 per cent  the percentage defined in the MDGs for 2015. Our great challenge is to reduce the pronounced disparities between regions.  Despite the economy’s problems  we are still fully determined to meet the social goals through such programmes as Families in Action  Bank of Opportunities and the Together Network  which focuses social tools on the poorest spheres. That is all supported by very ambitious goals in the areas of child nutrition  educational quality and coverage  vocational training  health insurance  connectivity and good management of social resources. With regard to the latter  our administrative reform  which has already been extended to 411 State entities  seeks to prevent the State from being discredited  eliminating bureaucratic wastefulness and achieving social efficiency.  The mortgage and financial crises are minor problems compared to the threats to the environment. Although Colombia produces 0.35 per cent of world greenhouse gas emissions  we are highly vulnerable to the ravages of climate change resulting from melting ice and floods. More than 51 per cent of our territory is preserved as rainforest and is a major net contributor of oxygen.   15 08-51839   Some of our most important environmental programmes include the building of mass transportation systems in nine cities  with plans under way for 10 more; a network of 66 000 rural families working as forest rangers  who are paid by the State to maintain collective areas free from illicit crops and to supervise the recovery and conservation of forests under the oversight of the United Nations; the conservation of 257 protected natural areas; the implementation of aqueduct and basic sanitation projects in the country’s 32 departments and the 1 102 municipalities; and the promotion of alternative energy sources such as wind power and biofuels.  There are three common objections to biofuels: the risk of destroying the rainforest  the elimination of areas for agricultural food production  and the small amount of energy generated compared to that used to produce it. Colombia has 578 000 square kilometres of rainforest and 43 million hectares of savannah. We will not allow the rainforest to be touched. Protecting it is our main contribution to combating global warming. With the available savannah  we can expand our agricultural production concentrated in 5 million hectares  increase the number of livestock to 24 million heads of cattle and  without affecting food production  develop a large biofuel industry that generates good quality jobs  increases income and becomes an alternative to coca  which fuels terrorism. Our productivity is high  thanks to sources of energy such as sugar cane and the African oil palm  which also protects the soil from direct sunlight and prevents erosion. For every energy unit used  8 energy units of ethanol are produced  or 6.5 units in biodiesel.  Illicit drugs are a great enemy of the environment  and they fuel terrorism. Colombia still suffers from violence because of illicit drugs. We speak of shared responsibility not to assign exclusive responsibilities to consumer countries  for  unfortunately  our young people also use drugs. We speak of shared responsibility to spur the world to combat production  trafficking  consumption  asset laundering and chemical precursors on an equal basis. Our Government requests that consumption be punished in our country and across the international community. We have extradited more than 800 persons. This year  we must spray 130 000 hectares of coca crops  while another 100 000 must be manually eradicated. Over the past five years  10 000 properties have been confiscated. However  there has been no significant reduction in illicit crop areas and consumption is on the rise.   Let us consider that situation. It is more difficult to carry out prevention and rehabilitation efforts against the backdrop of exponential growth in consumption resulting from a permissive attitude. The destruction of the rainforest to plant coca  the erosion of the soil and the pollution caused by chemical precursors are enormous affronts on the environmental balance. Whoever buys a personal dose of illicit drugs encourages a child to become a distributor and  later  a feared criminal. Whoever buys a personal dose of illicit drugs helps to set off a car bomb in Colombia and to destroy four trees from our Amazon rainforest.  Investors from all over the world are coming to Colombia every day. Twice as many tourists  from every corner of the world  are visiting our country as were five years ago. Many of those who looked on our country with scepticism and spoke about Colombia as a failed State can now discern clear signals of institutional strength and democratic boldness. Colombia today generates more trust and respect  but the work goes on. To free us all from the horrors of drug trafficking  terrorism and poverty  we need more resolute support from the international community. I would very much like to thank the United Nations for its very significant presence in our country. "
"39",1583,"COM",63,2008,"We are extremely pleased to see Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann presiding over the sixty-third session of the General Assembly. I take this opportunity to express my sincere thanks to His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon  Secretary-General of our Organization  for his commitment and active role in the service of the United Nations and for promoting its ideals of justice and peace.  The world today is faced with innumerable challenges. We who govern our respective countries bear a heavy responsibility. We must become increasingly concerned about the fate of our world. Why are we going through all these crises? Why are there so many centres of tension throughout the world? Why is there so much poverty and vulnerability in our universe? Why is terrorism spreading throughout the globe? Those are questions that must be addressed by each one of us  by our collective conscience and  first and foremost  by the United Nations  whose key purpose remains the defence of the ideals of peace  justice  solidarity and development.  Today’s reality is quite different. Unfortunately  all those values are far from being solidly established. The most privileged nations must therefore show greater concern for the fate of some parts of the world and  in particular  for developing countries where violence  hunger  disease  injustice of all sorts conflicts and their consequences are facts of daily life.  The double crisis of food and energy  to mention but two  requires a new surge of solidarity at the international level. The crisis affects the entire world  but is felt particularly in developing countries. Furthermore  we firmly believe in multilateralism. That is why the reform of the major organs of the United Nations is required today to ensure greater firmness and effectiveness.   Last March  Operation Democracy in the Comoros put an end to a rebellion that had shaken the island of Anjouan and re-established constitutional legality. As I promised  free  transparent and democratic elections took place on the island last June  enabling us to complete the establishment of local Governments on the islands of the Union of the Comoros.  Therefore  I would like to pay heartfelt tribute to the African Union  the League of Arab States and the friendly countries of Tanzania  the Sudan  Libya  Morocco  Senegal  France and the United States of America  which have all supported us morally  materially or financially in our task to complete without bloodshed the delicate operation of freeing the island of Anjouan.  Firmly resolved to consolidate the renewed stability and in line with the commitment made to our partners  I have decided to organize as soon as possible an inter-Comorian conference to bring together political movements  local island Governments  civil society and the Comoros’ partners. The conference will focus on the outstanding institutional issues that have long been a source of misunderstanding between the central Government and the federal entities. Initial contacts with the international community have been established to muster the support necessary to convene that national gathering which is required to improve the functioning of our national institutions.  Economic difficulties cannot allow us to lose sight of other major challenges  including environmental problems  which particularly affect the small island developing States  of which the Indian Ocean islands are a part. Thus  as head of State of the country currently holding the chairmanship of the Indian Ocean Commission  which has observer status at the United Nations  I would like to reiterate our subregional organization’s desire to contribute to implementing the Mauritius Strategy. I also take this opportunity to thank the European Union for having agreed to finance a programme of support for the Indian Ocean Commission within the framework of the tenth European Development Fund as the Union’s   15 08-51845  contribution to the implementation of the Mauritius Strategy.  I appeal to the United Nations and to the international community to support the efforts of the Indian Ocean Commission to ensure the successful development and integration of its Member States and to pay particular attention to the issue of implementing the Mauritius Strategy.  Every individual and every nation aspires to justice  dignity and freedom. Those are the ideals of the United Nations system to which we must remain faithful if peace  security and development are to ensure the progress of humanity.  On the basis of respect for those values  allow me to inform this Assembly of the great concern of the people and the Government of the Comoros with regard to the issue of the Comorian island of Mayotte. I would like to note that  following talks undertaken with France on that issue since last September following my meeting with President Nicolas Sarkozy  I did not intend to raise the issue at this session. The high-level working group that was set up for that purpose on the initiative of the French President provides  I believe  an ideal bilateral framework to study all aspects of the issue.  However  the intention recently declared by the French authorities to organize a referendum in 2009 with a view to transforming Mayotte into a French department forces me to raise the issue here. It will be agreed that such a decision  coming at a moment when discussions are under way between the two parties  will not favour an open and constructive dialogue. Therefore  in order to throw further light on the justification of the Comorian claim to the island of Mayotte  allow me to set out certain important facts that need to be taken into account when we analyse the issue.   Throughout the years of French colonization  the Comorian archipelago  comprised of the four islands of Anjouan  Grande Comore  Mayotte and Mohéli  was a single physical  geographical  religious  cultural and linguistic entity. Under French domestic law  and ever since Anjouan  Grande Comore and Mohéli were established as a French protectorate  they were combined with Mayotte to form a single territory.  The first text on that issue was the decree of September 1889. Since then  the political and administrative unity of the Comoros archipelago has never been questioned in any document  despite the plethora of provisions adopted with regard to the Comoros. I would refer  for example  to the law of 9 May 1946  the law of 17 April 1952  the decree of 22 July 1957  the law of 22 December 1961 and the law of 3 January 1968.  Thus  each time the French legislature or regulatory authority has acted  it has done so by considering the archipelago of the Comoros to constitute a single territory.   It is clear then that the French Republic has never called into question the territorial unity of the archipelago of the Comoros  while international public opinion has consistently considered that the four islands of the Comoros form a single territory  subject to the French Republic and administered most recently under the provisions of article 72 and following the French Constitution.  It was in that spirit that at the end of 1974 we implemented the procedure provided for by article 53 of the French Constitution  which aimed to gain the support of those affected by the accession to independence of the archipelago of the Comoros.  In accordance with the law of 23 November 1974  the people of the archipelago of the Comoros were invited to vote on whether they wished the territory to gain independence.   In all the islands  namely  in Anjouan  Mohéli  Mayotte and Grande Comore  on 22 December 1974  overall a positive answer was given to the question posed.   The question was put to the Comorian people as a single  indivisible people and over 96 per cent voted in favour of independence  in accordance with the law based on article 53 of the French Constitution.  However  at that time the French Parliament  rather than simply ratifying that decision of the people  wanted to draw up another law organizing another referendum on the pretext that in Mayotte about 60 per cent had voted against.  But the question had been put to the Comorian people  comprising the population of Mayotte  Anjouan  Mohéli and Grande Comore  and the result translated into overall terms as that did not in any way affect the letter and spirit of the law.    08-51845 16   Faced with the unwillingness of the French Parliament at that time to recognize the irrevocable verdict of the Comorian people  the late President Ahmed Abdallah Abdérémane  with the backing of the Comorian people  unilaterally declared the independence of the Comoros on 6 July 1975.  Looking beyond such measures  which come under French domestic law  I should like to stress the principle of the inviolability  under international law  of borders inherited from the colonial era and thereby to make it clear that the Comorian demand is indeed in conformity with the law.   Lastly  I would like to remind the Assembly that the Comoros  comprising Mayotte  Anjouan  Mohéli and Grande Comore  was admitted into this prestigious Organization on 12 November 1975  as demarcated by its borders  without France showing its opposition to that admission.  Today  there are good grounds for our great concern over France’s official statements regarding the departmentalization of the Comorian island of Mayotte. Those statements are not in keeping with the principles of justice  fairness and respect for international law  for which the great country of France is known.   For that reason  my country as of now considers any ballot organized on the question of making the Comorian island Mayotte a department to be null and void. Such are the facts — and the facts speak for themselves.  However  today the reality is that France is in Mayotte notwithstanding the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and all the other international organizations that have been regularly seized of the matter. Against that background  I have entered into talks with the French President  His Excellency Mr. Nicolas Sarkozy  who has shown a willingness to find a solution to the problem.  It may therefore be hoped that that legitimate claim of the Comoros to the island of Mayotte will soon have a happy outcome. I am particularly confident of that  because many outstanding problems throughout the world have been settled and others are on the way to being settled since His Excellency President Nicolas Sarkozy assumed France’s highest office.   Let me take this opportunity to make a solemn appeal to the French Government to strive to preserve a climate conducive to a committed dialogue  which has our support and which  in order to result in a negotiated settlement will need to take into account the concern of the Comoros that its national unity and territorial integrity be respected.   Moreover  I urge the international community to help to reconcile the views of the two parties along those lines  because the unity of the four islands of the Comoros  as well as peace and lasting stability for the archipelago  are a prerequisite for its harmonious development.  In conclusion  may I express the sincere thanks of the Comorian delegation to all the American authorities for the particularly warm welcome and the good arrangements made to ensure the success of this sixty-third session of the General Assembly.

"40",1622,"CPV",63,2008,"First  I congratulate Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann on his election to the presidency of the Assembly at its sixty-third session. I wish him a successful presidency. I also    08-51839 36  salute Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and express my highest regard for his commitment to peace  dialogue and prosperity for all.  The world grows in complexity  with its multiple challenges and numerous risks and uncertainties. This calls for increased multilateralism  more collective responsibility and greater cooperation. In short  it demands and expects more and better from the United Nations.  The world is undergoing a profound and multifaceted crisis in the financial  energy  food and environmental areas. Indeed  we face an environment fraught with uncertainty in the short and long term  underscored by financial instability  foreign exchange volatility  escalating oil and food prices and a globally troubled world economy. There is risk to our economic  human  political and military security — in other words  our general and collective security.  On the one hand  organized transnational crime and terrorism threaten international order and the rule of law. On the other hand  the effects of global warming and climate change  as well as the risks imposed by their worsening  are real facts that confront world leaders and institutions.  World peace remains out of reach. Areas of armed conflict still exist. Indeed  they resurge repeatedly or persist at low intensity. In the meantime  new sources of tension arise in many places. However  I believe we agree that war is not the best way to overcome these challenges.  We also have failed to build security and trust among all and for all  large and small  rich and poor. Without security  without social stability  without political and institutional cohesion  and above all without mutual trust between the international political actors  it is difficult to further the premises that may contribute to ensuring a solution to major global problems  resolving our main challenges  overcoming extreme poverty and the most pervasive endemic diseases  as well as moving past current global social and economic imbalances.  With the adoption of the Millennium Development Goals the international community expressly undertook to contribute to overcoming this unsustainable situation. I therefore urge the Assembly to work towards the preservation of an international environment favourable to the achievement of the commitment that we undertook — the social and economic growth of the poorest countries  the eradication of extreme poverty  the consolidation of peace  dialogue and international cooperation towards international balance  the defence of life and the planet’s future.  The current financial crisis is underscored by the instability of the financial markets and the volatility in the movement of capital  which put our worldwide economic stability at risk. We must retain the global financial architecture. It seems necessary for us to agree on new forms of financial regulation that are effective  trustworthy and acceptable to all.  The food crisis has placed hundreds of millions of people in a precarious situation. It is clear that urgent action is required to ensure increased agricultural production capable of meeting current and future needs. That requires the promotion of agricultural policies consistent with the demands of the situation  the partnership of the rich and technologically more advanced countries and technical assistance from international organizations; it means that attention must be given to modernizing and increasing agricultural production and productivity in the affected countries and regions. I think specifically of my country and the African continent.   Escalating oil prices have created serious problems for the economies of the least developed and non-producing countries. I ask  why not consider forms of compensation for the poorest and most affected nations in view of the enormous financial surpluses that have been accumulated? Admittedly  such an act of justice and solidarity would not be enough. We must therefore act individually and collectively and continue to promote energy alternatives and energy efficiency  as well as encourage reduced dependence on fossil fuels. Urgent and global measures are required to overcome the serious environmental crisis and to develop innovative and safe options for the future of humanity. That is the challenge that we must take up for the sake of the future and that we must overcome for the benefit of all.   We surely agree that humanity is at a decisive moment in history that clearly runs counter to the paradigms of its recent past — a time when a new world is painfully coming into being.   Recent experiences show that no single nation can in isolation solve the great challenges and global   37 08-51839  problems which the world faces. However  our universal institution does present the essential conditions and the required collective responsibility for such an endeavour. Therefore  it is incumbent on the United Nations to shoulder the tremendous mission of promoting more effective world governance.   However  to perform such a role  which is now more complex than ever  the United Nations is called upon to adapt itself to the challenges of the twenty-first century  to express the major shaping forces of the contemporary world and to ensure and convey confidence to all of its Member States. Accordingly  the United Nations system must be reformed and improved and  above all  the representativeness and legitimacy of the Security Council must be urgently expanded and strengthened.   Thirty-five years ago  on 4 September 1973  the Republic of Guinea-Bissau acceded to national sovereignty. I salute the delegation of Guinea-Bissau in this room. It is our firm conviction that our brother nation will be able to overcome all the difficulties currently facing it and to consolidate the foundations of its stability under the rule of law.   Allow me also to welcome the recent legislative elections in Angola and to congratulate the people and authorities of Angola for the responsible and transparent manner in which those important elections were conducted.   I would further like to welcome the political agreements that led to the end of the political crisis in Zimbabwe. That is a testament to the emancipation of our continent and to its aspiration to progress  and thus helps to usher in the new era and the new world that we so eagerly desire."
"41",1668,"CRI",63,2008,"I received the news of your election to the General Assembly presidency  Sir  with a brother’s pride. Twenty-one years ago  it was through war in Central America that we became acquainted. Today it is peace that allows us to meet once more. In the name of the people of Costa Rica  and in my own name as well  I am honoured to extend to you a brotherly Central American greeting.  I have come here to speak words of the urgency that any leader feels at decisive moments in history. This is not just any year. While we hold this General Assembly  millions of people who used to be able to meet their most basic needs have seen the face of poverty once again. Hunger  that abominable monster that we had escaped for so many years  has returned to chase away the dreams of humanity. Pessimism and hopelessness have taken control of our economies  and  as always  the poorest among us will pay the consequences. World military spending has reached $3.3 billion per day  but international aid continues to reach the poorest countries at a snail’s pace and fails to reach middle-income countries altogether. Brutal hurricanes and intense droughts remind us that this planet reacts to our irrationality  and the time that remains for us may be a countdown to disaster if we do not make a change.  It may be that in no other General Assembly have issues more global than now been discussed. Our interdependence has made us all vulnerable  but in that interdependence also lies our strength. In the past  a nation could avert its gaze from distant suffering and scorn the pain of others. Today  that option does not exist. Every victory and every failure is shared.   The man who  motivated by hunger  cuts down a tree in the virgin Amazon rainforest unwittingly deprives us of a fraction of the air we breathe in this room. The European mother who is forced to buy less food because she cannot afford the costs unwittingly affects the economy of all nations in the world. The African child who drops out of school because of a lack of resources unwittingly determines the future performance of our species. We are all united in that  and perhaps for the first time in history  no one can look in another direction. We are seated simultaneously at the prosecutor’s bench and at the defence table  in the public gallery and in the judge’s chair.   We must take advantage of this moment when equality among nations is seen in the equality of our challenges. We will not be able to face our realities unless we understand them completely. We will not be able to shine the light of reason upon our Earth if we intentionally leave some regions in the dark. If we are seriously to take up the challenges of our time it is right that like that old protagonist of the Charles Dickens tale  we open our eyes to our past  our present and our future; we must guarantee peace and justice for the past  peace and development for the present  peace and nature for the future.  In the Preamble to the United Nations Charter  the States that make up this Organization undertook to establish conditions under which justice can be   41 08-51839  maintained. Of those conditions  perhaps the most important is will: the will to demand that our obligations are fulfilled; the will to speak out when international law is violated; and  above all  the will to ensure that acts that are an affront to all humankind do not go unnoticed.  Evil springs not only from action but also and  above all  from omission. To keep silent when crimes are grave and responsibilities are clear is not to remain neutral but is to side with the aggressors. Our recent past is marked by horrendous  unpunished crimes that call out  not for vengeance  but for justice. We cannot accept that evil is banal. If we do not want to repeat the painful history of Kosovo and Bosnia  of Rwanda and Kampuchea  then it is time for the international community to demand that those responsible for the crimes committed in Darfur be judged before the international criminal court. Costa Rica will oppose any attempt to avoid such a path  which is the path of peace. Forgiveness is based on memory  not on dissimulation; and peace will be possible only through memory. We must understand  in the words of Elie Wiesel  “that the memory of evil will serve as a shield against evil; that the memory of death will serve as a shield against death”.  If the spirit of the past calls on us to hold people responsible for the violation of human rights  the spirit of the present calls on us to ensure that those rights are fulfilled today. Governments can indirectly hurt their peoples in many ways  one of which is excessive military spending. In developing nations  in particular  every long-range missile  every helicopter gunship and every tank is a symbol of the deferred needs of our people. On a planet where one sixth of the population lives on less than a dollar a day  spending $1.2 trillion on arms and soldiers is an offence and a symbol of irrationality because the security of a satisfied world is more certain than the security of an armed world. Latin America is not immune to this phenomenon. Last year Latin American military spending reached $39 billion  in a region that has never been more peaceful or more democratic.  I know of no greater perversion of values and no greater misplacement of priorities. With a small percentage of world military spending we could give drinking water to all of humanity  equip all homes with electricity  achieve universal literacy  and eradicate all preventable diseases. I am not talking about the utopia of a world without armies. Unfortunately  that is an idea whose time has not yet come. I am talking about tiny percentages of an expenditure that could be reduced without harming the ability of countries to defend themselves — particularly developing countries. That is why my Government has presented the Costa Rica consensus  an initiative that would establish mechanisms to forgive debts and use international financial resources to support developing nations that spend more and more on environmental protection  education  health care and housing for their people and less and less on arms and soldiers. I am convinced that that will bring us greater development  greater security and greater peace than all the money that we have now set aside for our armies. I humbly ask members today to support this initiative.  I also ask for members’ support for the arms trade treaty that Costa Rica is advocating within this Organization  to prohibit the transfer of arms to States  groups or individuals if there is sufficient reason to believe that those arms will be used to violate human rights or international law  or to interfere with sustainable development. The destructive power of the world’s existing 640 million small arms and light weapons  most in the hands of civilians  deserves the same attention or even more attention than military spending.  However  no matter how urgent it may be to ensure the present development of our peoples  it is equally important to ensure their future development. The spirit of the future  as we look ahead to it  offers us a desolate image. Imagine an unending desert  a cracked ground too hot to stand on. Imagine a planet where life has been displaced and only cockroaches  if anything  can survive. Imagine a world whose range of colours  which until now has been endless  is reduced to grays and dark browns. Imagine polluted air  impossible to breathe. “This is not a poor copy of John’s delirium during his exile on Patmos” as Gabriel Garcia Márquez once said. I am not describing the Apocalypse but simply the world that awaits us if we do not take action right away to declare “peace with nature”.  Sixty years ago an illustrious Costa Rican  a visionary and brave man  José Figueres Ferrer  abolished my country’s army. What had been the general headquarters of the Costa Rican armed forces is today our main national museum. Our children have never seen a column of soldiers on the march; they know only the march of columns of ants. No Costa    08-51839 42  Rican children know the difference between this or that missile  or this or that combat plane  but they can distinguish among the trees of the forest and the animals of the sea; they know the importance of the water cycle  of wind energy  of rivers and of sun. Ours is a nation of peace among humans  but we also aspire to be a nation of peace with all forms of life.  We have set a goal of becoming carbon-neutral by 2021. Last year we became the world leader for the number of trees per capita and square kilometre  planting 5 million trees. In 2008 we will plant 7 million more. We are leading an international crusade against global warming and environmental destruction  with a special focus on the planet’s primary forests. Today  Assembly members  I ask you to join us.  The march of humanity through history is neither linear nor continuous. It is marked by detours and pitfalls  and even by painful setbacks. As in Pedro Calderón de la Barcá’s play La Vida es Sueña  one morning we awake as princes and the next we are no more than beggars. But not everything in life is a dream. There are concrete realities that we have been able to build. There are indisputable achievements in the history of humankind. This Organization is one of them. Members may tell me that the United Nations is founded on the search for peace  understanding among peoples and respect for international law. That is all true. But I dare to say that more than anything else this Organization is founded on hope  the hope that our march is upward  that our future will be better  and that a promised land lies behind the deserts of violence and injustice that  with courage  we have been able to cross.  I assure this Assembly that if we confront the spirit of our past  of our present and of our future  if we build peace on a base of justice  development and nature  and if we turn away from forgetfulness  arms and environmental destruction we will reach that promised land some day and our children and our children’s children will never again be beggars in the kingdom of their dreams. "
"42",1737,"CUB",63,2008,"Mr. President  on behalf of Cuba  I would like to congratulate you on your election as President of the General Assembly.  We are living at a decisive moment in the history of humankind. The threats looming over the world put the very existence of the human species at risk.  The promotion of peace  solidarity  social justice and sustainable development is the only way to ensure the future. The prevailing world order  unjust and unsustainable  must be replaced by a new system that is truly democratic and equitable  based on respect for international law and on the principles of solidarity and justice  putting an end to the inequalities and exclusion to which the great majorities of the population of our planet have been condemned.  There are no alternatives. Those responsible for this state of affairs — the industrialized countries  and in particular the lone super-Power — must shoulder their responsibilities. Fabulous fortunes cannot continue to be wasted while millions of human beings are starving or dying of curable diseases. It is not possible to continue to pollute the air and poison the oceans  which is destroying the living conditions for future generations. Neither the peoples nor the planet itself will permit that without great social upheavals and extremely grave natural disasters.  Wars of conquest  aggression against and the illegal occupation of countries  military intervention and the bombing of innocent civilians  the unbridled arms race  the pillaging and usurpation of the natural resources of the Third World and the imperial offensive to crush the resistance of peoples who are defending their rights constitute the greatest and most serious threats to international peace and security.  Concepts such as the limitation of sovereignty  pre-emptive war and regime change are expressions of the desire to mutilate the independence of our countries. The so-called war on terrorism and the alleged promotion of freedoms serve as pretexts for aggression  military occupation  torture  arbitrary detention  the denial of the right of peoples to self-determination  unjust blockades  unilaterally imposed sanctions and the imposition of political  economic and social models that facilitate imperial domination with flagrant disdain for history  cultures and the sovereign will of peoples.  The gap between the rich and the poor widens daily. The very modest Millennium Development Goals are an unattainable dream for the vast majority. While $1 trillion is spent on weapons worldwide  more than 850 million human beings are starving  1.1 billion have no access to drinking water  2.6 billion lack sewage services and more than 800 million are illiterate. More than 640 million children lack adequate housing  115 million do not attend primary school and 10 million die before reaching the age of 5  in most cases as the result of diseases that can be cured.   With increasing frequency  the populations of the South are suffering from natural disasters  whose consequences have been worsened by climate change. Haiti  Jamaica  Cuba and other countries of the Caribbean are examples. We issue a special call for solidarity with the brotherly people of Haiti in their tragic situation.  The rise in oil prices is the result of irrational consumption  heavy speculative activity and imperial military adventures. The desperate search for new sources of energy has propelled the criminal strategy driven by the Government of the United States to transform grains and cereals into fuel.  For many of the countries of the Non-Aligned Movement  the situation is becoming unsustainable. Our nations have suffered and will have to continue to suffer the consequences of the irrationality  wastefulness and speculation of a few countries in the industrialized North  which are responsible for the world food crisis. They imposed trade liberalization and financial prescriptions of structural adjustment on the developing countries. They caused the ruin of many small producers; they denied — and in some cases destroyed — nascent agricultural development in the countries of the South  turning them into net importers of food.   It is they who continue scandalous agricultural subsidies while imposing their rules on international trade. They set prices  monopolize technologies  impose unjust certifications and manipulate distribution channels  financing sources and trade. They control transport  scientific research  gene pools and the production of fertilizers and pesticides.    08-51749 38   We have not come here to complain. We have come  on behalf of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  to support and defend the demands of billions of human beings who are calling for justice and respect for their rights. The formula is not difficult; nor does it require great sacrifices. All that is needed is the necessary political will  less selfishness and the objective understanding that  if we do not act today  the consequences could be apocalyptic and would also affect the rich and powerful. That is why Cuba  on behalf of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  calls once again on the Governments of developed countries to honour their commitments. In particular  we urge them to do the following.   They should put an end to the wars of occupation and to the plundering of the resources of the countries of the Third World  and should free up at least a part of their millions in military spending so that those resources can be allocated to international assistance for the benefit of sustainable development.  We urge them to cancel the foreign debt of developing countries  which has already been paid more than once. That would release additional resources that could be devoted to economic development and social programmes.  They should honour the commitment to allocate at least 0.7 per cent of their gross domestic product to official development assistance without conditions  so that the countries of the South could use those resources for their national priorities. They should also promote access on the part of poor countries to substantial new financing.  They are urged to devote one fourth of the money that is wasted each year on commercial advertising to food production  which would provide nearly $250 billion more to fight hunger and malnutrition.  They should allocate the money being used for agricultural subsidies in the North to agricultural development in the South. Thus  our countries would have approximately $1 billion per day at their disposal to invest in food production.  We urge them to comply with the commitments set out in the Kyoto Protocol and to establish more ambitious emission-reduction targets beginning in 2012  without seeking to increase restrictions on countries that  even now  maintain far lower per capita emission levels than those of the countries of the North.   They should promote access by Third World countries to technology and should support the training of their human resources. Today  on the other hand  qualified personnel from the South are subjected to unfair competition and incentives resulting from discriminatory and selective migration policies implemented by the United States and Europe.  Something that is today more urgent than ever is the establishment of a democratic and equitable international order and a fair and transparent trading system in which all States can participate  in sovereignty  in the decisions that affect them.  It is our deepest belief that solidarity between peoples and Governments is possible. In Latin America and the Caribbean  the Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas and Petrocaribe have demonstrated this.  The Movement of Non-Aligned Countries has remained faithful to its founding principles. We support the cause of the Palestinian people and their inalienable right to self-determination in an independent and sovereign State  with its capital in East Jerusalem. We support the cause of those other peoples whose sovereignty and territorial integrity is being threatened  like those of Venezuela and Bolivia  and we endorse the right of Puerto Rico to be independent.  We condemn the imposition of unilateral coercive measures in violation of international law and attempts to implant a single model for a political  economic and social system. We object to the negative practice of certifying countries that follows the patterns and interests of the powerful. We strongly oppose political manipulation and the application of double standards in the matter of human rights  and we reject the selective imposition of politically motivated resolutions against the member countries of the Non-Aligned Movement.  The establishment of the Human Rights Council offers the opportunity to open a new era in the promotion of and protection for all human rights for all  on the basis of international cooperation and constructive dialogue. Those who caused the demise of the old Human Rights Commission are now trying to disqualify the Council because they have not been able to bend it to serve their own interests. They refuse to participate in its work in order to escape the scrutiny of the international community within the framework of   39 08-51749  the Universal Periodic Review mechanism. The legitimacy of the Council does not depend on the perception that the empire has about its work  but on its capacity to discharge its mandate with the strictest adherence to the principles of universality  objectivity  impartiality and non-selectivity in the treatment of human rights issues.  The Movement of Non-Aligned Countries will continue to defend the interests of the Third World and promote the building of a world which is more just  more democratic and with greater solidarity.   Cuba has had to pay a very high price for the defence of its independence and sovereignty. The heroic Cuban people have endured the longest and cruellest blockade in history  imposed by the most powerful nation on Earth. Despite the fact that this Assembly has repeatedly and resoundingly taken a stand in favour of ending that genocidal policy  the United States Government has not only ignored the will of the international community  but in marked disregard of it has gradually intensified its economic war against Cuba. Never has the foreign policy against a country been armed with such a broad and sophisticated arsenal of aggressive measures in the political  economic  cultural  diplomatic  military  psychological and ideological domains.  Cuba has just been lashed by two intense hurricanes  which have devastated its agriculture  seriously affected part of its infrastructure and damaged or destroyed more than 400 000 homes. Allow me to take advantage of this opportunity  on behalf of the Cuban Government and people  to thank all those countries  organizations and persons who in one way or another have honestly and sincerely contributed with resources or moral support to the reconstruction efforts undertaken by my country. That stands in contrast with the position of the United States Government  which continues to ruthlessly apply the blockade.  Cuba has asked for no gifts from the United States Government. It has simply asked and asked again that it be allowed to purchase in the United States the materials that are indispensable for the reconstruction of homes and the power grid  and that American companies be authorized to grant Cuba private commercial credits to buy food. The answer has been negative and has been accompanied by an attempt to manipulate information in such a manner that the Government of the United States seems to be concerned for the well-being of the Cuban people while the Government of Cuba is perceived as turning down their offer.  If the United States were really so concerned for the Cuban people  the only moral and ethical behaviour would be to lift the blockade imposed on Cuba for five decades  in violation of the most elemental rules of international law and the Charter of the United Nations. That irrational policy has a clear objective: to destroy the process of profound revolutionary transformation undertaken by the Cuban people since 1959 — in other words  to trample on its right to self-determination  wrest away its freedom and its political  economic and social conquests and push it backwards to its former neocolonial status.   The Bush Administration attempts to justify the intensification of its policy against Cuba by turning once more to fraud and deceit  with its characteristic cynicism and hypocrisy. Its determination to dominate and recolonize Cuba is being presented as nothing less than as an endeavour to liberate and democratize.  Who  other than its accomplices  recognizes that the United States Government has any authority in this world in the matter of democracy and human rights? What authority could such a Government claim that hunts down and cruelly mistreats illegal migrants at its southern border  that legalizes the use of torture and keeps in concentration camps — such as the one installed in the territory illegally occupied by the United States base at Guantánamo — people who have not been proved of or even charged with any crime? What respect is due to a Government that attacks the sovereignty of other States  using the excuse of the fight against terrorism  while at the same time guaranteeing impunity to anti-Cuban terrorists? What kind of justice can be promoted by an Administration that illegally keeps imprisoned five Cuban patriots who were only seeking information to neutralize the actions of the terrorist groups operating against Cuba from the United States?  Cuba appreciates the solidarity it has received from the General Assembly in its fight against the blockade and the aggression that it has had to confront for almost five decades. Cuba reaffirms its unyielding decision to defend its sovereignty and independence. Cuba reiterates its will to carry on  together with members of the Non-Aligned Movement  in the battle    08-51749 40  for a better world  where the rights of all peoples to justice and development are respected.  To conclude  I would like to recall the words of the Commander-in-Chief of the Cuban Revolution  Comrade Fidel Castro Ruz: “A world without hunger is possible. ... A just world is possible. A new world  which our species eminently deserves  is possible and will become reality.” "
"43",1783,"CYP",63,2008,"I wish first to extend sincere congratulations to Mr. D’Escoto Brockmann on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session and to express my appreciation for the work done by his predecessor  Mr. Srgjan Kerim. I would also like to thank the Secretary-General for his report (A/63/1) on the work of the Organization  and I welcome his comprehensive approach to threats and his focus on recently emerged challenges.  It is an honour for me to address the General Assembly for the first time as President of the Republic of Cyprus. Maintaining the effectiveness of multilateral diplomacy and strengthening the relevance of the United Nations has been one of the cornerstones of the foreign policy of the Republic of Cyprus since it won its independence in 1960.  The United Nations is important to the international community and particularly important to Cyprus. It is an essential institution for our global survival and for the further development of humankind in a balanced and fair way in increasingly difficult conditions. Our peoples look to the United Nations as the best forum for addressing such global problems as poverty  climate change  rising energy and food prices  diseases  natural disasters  human rights abuses and many other pressing global problems. Either we do things together in a collective  coordinated way or the problems will persist and become even less manageable.  This week  two important issues are being given particular attention — the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals and the special needs of Africa. I applaud the focus being given to both  highlighting the imperative need for collective action by the international community. However  we must match our words with deeds.  Cyprus emerged from colonialism as an impoverished independent State in 1960. Despite the fact that Cyprus has suffered greatly  we have managed to improve our economy. Today  Cyprus is firmly committed to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals and maintains an emphasis on Africa in its overseas development assistance projects. Our approach is to focus on a small number of countries  concentrating our efforts on infrastructural development in the health and education sectors. Cyprus is gradually intensifying its efforts by increasing the level of assistance to additional countries.  Small States have higher stakes in multilateral diplomacy and in a fair and functional system of collective security  based on the principles of sovereign equality and respect for territorial integrity.  There is no clearer example of that than Cyprus itself. From the earliest days of its independence  Cyprus was forced to appeal to the world community for support in defending and preserving its independence  its sovereignty and its territorial integrity. It became a victim of foreign interference  which sowed the seeds of domestic problems for the new State. Those difficulties were exploited in the service of strategic interests alien to our independence and our territorial integrity. The culmination was the military coup instigated by the military junta of Athens and the Turkish military invasion of July and August 1974.   However  Cyprus survived. The will of the international community for Cyprus to survive is found in the plethora of Security Council and General Assembly resolutions — most of them  regrettably  not implemented. However  the moral support and resolute    08-51839 12  stance provided Cyprus with a sword and shield that have ensured that it has remained and will continue to remain an undivided independent country with a single sovereignty  single citizenship and single international personality.  In addition  the resolutions of the United Nations on Cyprus contain two other important elements. They provide for a process of negotiations in the form of a good offices mission of the Secretary-General and  very importantly  they define the legal and political framework on which the discussions for the federal architecture of the Cypriot State will be built. Both of those elements are crucial. I firmly believe that our success in the new effort that is now beginning will depend upon respecting those essential conditions.  The President returned to the Chair.  With regard to the process of the Secretary-General’s good offices mission  it entails negotiations with the Cypriots themselves in which they are the principal players. They are the owners of the process. The Cypriots themselves must build the State they envision for their society. The role of the Secretary-General and of the international community is to assist and to support. We are grateful for that. Good offices are not arbitration; they are not mediation. Recent experience has shown that any attempt to impose — and even to import — non-Cypriot-inspired and improvised models will meet with rejection by the Cypriot people.  The relevant Security Council resolutions are also important for the new effort because they provide the legal political framework within which the effort must take place. That framework prescribes a bizonal and bicommunal federation with a single international personality  single indivisible sovereignty and single citizenship. The federal institutions will embody the principle of political equality as defined by the relevant Security Council resolutions  in terms not of numerical equality but of effective participation by the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities in all organs of the federal State.  It is important to remind ourselves that a bizonal and bicommunal federation has been the only mutually agreed basis since 1977. It was reaffirmed as recently as a few weeks ago. It represents a compromise  and indeed the only possible compromise  on which a political arrangement can be built. The relevant resolutions of the Security Council and the Constitution of Cyprus exclude partition  secession or union with any other country.  The kind of solution we agree to must take into account not only our history and international legality  but also the kind of society we are and the kind of society we want to bequeath to our children. In that society  all Cypriot children must be born free and equal. Human rights and the fair satisfaction of human needs must take precedence over strategic considerations dictated by political expedience.  A new intensive effort started on 3 September with the aim of overcoming the impasses of the past and achieving progress that will lead to the reunification of Cyprus under mutually agreed terms and the withdrawal of foreign troops after 34 years of division and foreign occupation. If that effort is to succeed  there is a need for political will on the part of Cypriots  as well as the positive engagement of other important players  which for historical reasons have been part of the problem and need to become part of the solution.  For my part  I want to assure the General Assembly from this rostrum that my political will to do what is necessary to solve the problem is firm and deep-rooted. My origins are in the Progressive Party of Working People of Cyprus and in the popular movement of the island  which prides itself on a long history of struggles  and indeed sacrifices  in defence of friendship  cooperation and peaceful coexistence between Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots. On the other hand  I am one of those Cypriots who was deeply and directly affected by the foreign military invasion of 1974  because I myself and my family are internally displaced persons — refugees in our own country. The role of Cypriots is to agree on what they want. We must try to achieve that with the leader of the Turkish Cypriot community  Mehmet Ali Talat. I believe that we can achieve it.  But that is not enough to achieve a solution. Turkey should contribute to the process in a positive way. Turkey still maintains over 40 000 troops and tens of thousands of settlers in Cyprus and can  without a doubt  determine the outcome of the issues under discussion. We believe that the solution should benefit everybody and will benefit everybody. It would allow Cypriots — Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots alike — to live together and work together in an independent  prosperous country within the family of   13 08-51839  the European Union  without the presence of foreign armies and illegal colonists and under conditions of security and respect for their identity and their rights.  Our world faces many problems  which are becoming increasingly complex. It is our conviction that those problems can be solved and that new threats can be prevented only through effective multilateral collective action. Peace must prevail — a true peace based on respect for international law and not the right of might. A response to the problem of international terrorism will be effective only if our world becomes less unjust. If hunger and poverty are not tackled  if regional disputes are not resolved on the basis of international legitimacy  and if global wealth is not distributed more fairly  peace cannot grow strong roots.  The United Nations is an achievement of our fathers and a necessary tool for ensuring a more stable  fair and prosperous world. Ultimately  the United Nations is only as successful as we  the Member States  allow it to be. I wish our community of nations a successful sixty-third session of the General Assembly."
"44",1807,"CZE",63,2008,"Let me begin by extending my congratulations to you  Sir  on your election to the important function of President of the General Assembly. You will steer the deliberations of this key body of the United Nations through a    08-53129 32  difficult period of growing challenges to our common security and prosperity. Let me assure you of our full support in your endeavours. I also thank your predecessor  Mr. Kerim.  My country is in full preparation for an enormous task that has no precedent in our history. In January 2009  the Czech Republic will assume the responsibility of the presidency of the European Union. We will do our utmost to uphold our shared commitment to world peace and prosperity within that organization.  The European Union stands at the forefront of the efforts to strengthen the United Nations capacity to deliver effective international responses to global challenges. The Czech Republic is committed to playing its part and to further enhancing the European Union’s contribution by searching for common responses. The motto of the upcoming Czech presidency  “Europe without barriers”  reflects our desire to promote the removal of barriers not only within the European Union  but also between the Union and third countries. In our opinion  it is very much in line with the efforts to enhance cooperation and to strengthen the principle of effective multilateralism.  The agreements reached at the 2005 World Summit sparked some substantive reforms  but the process has reached a point at which it has become necessary to give it a new impulse for further progress. An important part of that progress is Security Council reform. A more representative and transparent Security Council will act with a greater international legitimacy and authority. The Czech Republic therefore welcomes the recent decision to launch the intergovernmental negotiations. However  the authority of the Security Council is being undermined by its inability to address some acute international issues. I call on the Council to reassert its authority in the maintenance of international peace and security and to shoulder its obligations.  The authority of the United Nations is being tested  and so are our political and moral responsibilities. By signing onto the Charter of the United Nations  all of our countries have committed themselves to living in peace and harmony and to respecting the principles of peaceful resolution of disputes and of refraining from the threat and use of force  except in self-defence. Today  as security is being challenged in too many parts of the world  those basic principles  and the system of international law in general  need to be upheld as ever.  And yet  we have recently witnessed systematic provocations and  finally  a military aggression on the part of a powerful country  a permanent member of the Security Council  against its small neighbour with the aim of carving that neighbour up. That action was designed to create two tiny entities  totally dependent in their administrative  economic and military structures. Colonial Powers used to act in that way  and I would like to stress that alleged interests  privileged as they may be considered  cannot justify the violation of our highest common principles  enshrined in the Charter of the United Nation. Therefore  I fully subscribe to the words pronounced by Sergey Lavrov here earlier today:   “We cannot tolerate any attempts to resolve conflict situations by violating international agreements or by the unlawful use of force. If we allow that to occur once  then we run the risk of unleashing it in the future” ().  However  how can one think of redesigning new Euro-Atlantic security structures without renewing the trust that has vanished over the past few months?  After the Czech Republic sent substantial humanitarian aid  it initiated an international support conference for Georgia  to be held next month in Brussels. We call upon the international community to help alleviate the suffering of the tens of thousands of people displaced by the conflict  as well as to help the country with post-conflict reconstruction. We insist that all internally displaced persons return home. The immediate task is to ensure that all military forces are withdrawn to pre-war positions. There is urgent need for the deployment of an international and impartial mission in Georgia to oversee the military withdrawals and ceasefire implementation. Let me stress once again  however  that a peaceful and lasting solution to the conflict must be based on full respect for the principle of Georgia’s independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity.  We need to step up efforts to combat international terrorism. The stakes remain high. With our deep condolences to the peoples of India and Pakistan  we strongly condemn the recent terrorist attacks in New Delhi and Islamabad. We must not be shaken  but must stand up to that scourge united  stronger and more determined. I was deeply moved by the condolences   33 08-53129  expressed by my Pakistani counterpart. It is touching to hear that from someone whose country has suffered immensely from terrorism.  Promoting and maintaining international security requires concerted action. While there is a need for strengthened United Nations peacekeeping capacity  other organizations can effectively complement the work of the United Nations in areas where they have a comparative advantage.  We have all felt the pains of stabilizing a war-torn country like Afghanistan. Despite the persisting lack of security  the international community continues to support development even in remote areas. By establishing and running the provincial reconstruction team in Logar province  my country has undertaken a long-term commitment to contribute to the security and development of Afghanistan. Let me express our full support for the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Afghanistan  Ambassador Kai Eide  and invite the United Nations to take a more active approach and enhance its involvement and assistance to Afghanistan. The Afghans need our support to turn President Karzai’s words  “we must do what it takes to win the battle of Afghanistan’s economic development” ()  into reality. A concerted effort between the Government of Afghanistan  the United Nations and other key international players  including Pakistan  is a prerequisite to achieving that goal.  The cooperation of the United Nations  the European Union and NATO needs to continue to the benefit of the Balkan region as a whole. Looking into the future  let me assure Members that both democratic and prosperous Serbia and Kosovo do have a place in the European family and that the Czech Republic is ready to lend them a helping hand. We in the Czech Republic have always had long-standing and traditionally close and friendly relations with Serbia and are keen to develop them further.  The recent arrest and transfer of Radovan Karadzic to the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia was a promising sign of cooperation of the new Serbian Government with the international community. I call on the Security Council to provide sufficient time to the Tribunal for the completion of its work.  The Czech Republic considers international criminal justice to be one of the pillars that uphold the basic values of the United Nations. The ad hoc tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda  as well as the Security Council decision of 2005 to refer the situation in Darfur to the International Criminal Court  must be supported in order to end impunity for the most serious crimes. Let me recall the Secretary-General’s commitment at the opening of this general debate: “We have the means to combat impunity and must therefore do so” (  p. 3).  We need to undertake some bold steps in the area of weapons of mass destruction and non-proliferation. We should reduce the risk of those weapons being misused or falling into the hands of terrorists. The immediate task is to ensure a successful outcome of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons review process and the entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.  In that context  I would like to express our concern over the Iranian and North Korean nuclear programmes. We fully recognize the indispensable right of every country to exploit nuclear power for civilian purposes  but we should act when it could be diverted towards military purposes  in breach of international commitments.  My country was among those that has vigorously called for a new universal norm to prevent risks stemming from the use of cluster munitions. The Czech Republic will be among the first to sign the new Convention on Cluster Munitions this December. I am convinced that the more countries that join the Convention  the more profound and positive the effect it will have on the lives of countless individuals and communities.  Security goes hand in hand with development and human rights. In the sixtieth year of the existence of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  there is still a long way to go from the merely formal commitments of Governments to achieving a universally shared respect for the rights and liberties of every human being.  In recent years  the United Nations human rights institutions have undergone long-awaited reform. However  our goals have been only partially achieved. Let me express my deep regret that the Human Rights Council has been unable to tackle several serious human rights situations in a timely and proper manner. Although the Council is putting meritorious effort into the newly established Universal Periodic Review mechanism  the political imbalance of its agenda and    08-53129 34  the attempts to weaken the role of special procedures and non-governmental organizations further diminish the expectations of reform. Moreover  flouting the appeals of the international community  as was done by the Myanmar regime  has to be denounced.   The Czech Republic supports the principle of responsibility to protect formulated at the 2005 World Summit. The international community has the responsibility to protect peoples worldwide in cases where their Governments are unable or unwilling to do so. Just over the past few years  we have seen some quite tragic examples desperately requiring our attention. I therefore welcome the Secretary-General’s efforts to advance that issue. A valuable contribution can also be made through the non-governmental initiatives of leaders such as Václav Havel  Kjell Magne Bondevik and Elie Wiesel. Earlier this week  I had the honour to host an event in New York aimed at presenting their thoughts and recommendations on the tragic human rights and humanitarian situation in North Korea.  This week  I took part in high-level meetings on Africa’s development needs and on the Millennium Development Goals. We have already witnessed early successes and setbacks  and we realize that some goals are more difficult to achieve than others. Now  at the halfway point to the target date  we are well aware of how much needs to be done in the remaining seven years. Our commitment to development  and notably to Africa  must not wane.  At the end of this year  the Follow-up International Conference on Financing for Development will present an opportunity to review the implementation of the Monterrey Consensus of 2002. The conclusion of the ongoing talks on the Doha Development Agenda within the World Trade Organization should also bring the tangible benefits of further trade liberalization for developing countries. To make that happen  the European Union has already shown the necessary flexibility. Other key actors have to follow suit if the talks are to get back on track and be concluded soon. In that context  let me recall once again the Czech presidency’s motto  “Europe without barriers”.  Let me assure the Assembly that the Czech Republic fully supports the European Union (EU) commitments to intensify EU development assistance. The Czech presidency of the Union will be yet another incentive for us to step up our development assistance.  Soaring food and commodity prices  as well as the negative impact of climate change  hamper international development. All those issues require strong political will. The new legal framework to reduce greenhouse gas emissions beyond 2012 is one of the most important issues. The Czech Republic is fully aware of the need to make significant progress towards the adoption of a new post-Kyoto agreement. The Czech presidency of the European Union will play an active role in that process  which will culminate in Copenhagen next year  where a new agreement should be adopted.  I have outlined just a few points that are awaiting our action. In many areas  time is running out. I would like to encourage all Members of this universal Organization to cooperate in our common efforts to make this world secure and prosperous. The Czech Republic is committed to doing its part. "
"45",1869,"DEU",63,2008,"I offer my congratulations to Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session. I wish him every success.  The United Nations mandate to establish and maintain peace and security has lost none of its urgency in 2008. The task remains. However  fulfilling it is more demanding than ever.  When the Berlin Wall fell  no one had greater hopes than we Germans not only that Germany would be reunited but that a new age of global cooperation — beyond the traditional front lines — would begin. The Iron Curtain had divided the world into two blocs and when it came to dealing with crises and conflicts  often enough  loyalty within the blocs had priority; what was needed to improve the lot of ordinary people was of secondary importance.   47 08-52265   The end of the East-West confrontation in the early nineties seemed to mark the dawn of a new age of effective multilateralism  while the United Nations seemed to be on the threshold of a great renaissance. Disillusionment has now set in  more quickly and more profoundly than we had feared. The hoped-for peace dividend did not materialize. On the contrary  the cynical certainties of the cold war had disappeared  and they were not replaced by new ones.   The world is clearly searching for a new order  and multilateralism does not always seem to be the first choice in this quest. What we have experienced since then is the confluence of the traditional power politics of the 19th century  the legacies of the cold war and the new challenges of the 21st century.  At the same time  new players and Powers that have still to find their place in the international order are seeking to enter the global stage. It is now generally accepted that we can master the new challenges of the twenty-first century  such as climate change  scarcity of raw materials  access to food and water and the fight against epidemics  pandemics and terrorism  only if we act together. Although we know that and although it is absolutely vital that we focus on finding common solutions to the key issues of the future  time and again we are called upon to resolve conflicts that have their roots in a past that we have only seemingly put behind us.  One conflict that smouldered for some time and then escalated suddenly and violently is the crisis in Georgia  where an entire region found itself on the edge of the abyss of war and destruction and where common sense failed to prevail on all sides. The United Nations  the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the European Union agree that the weapons must be silenced for good. We must help the suffering population without delay. That does not mean accepting the status quo; nor does it mean the calling into question of Georgia’s territorial integrity.  Nevertheless  we have to work together to ensure reconstruction  the return home of the refugees and long-term security in Georgia and the entire region. The European Union is making an important contribution by sending an observer mission  which my country is leading. Together with the United Nations and the OSCE  the mission will put forward a comprehensive strategy in Geneva this October. We are aiming to pave the way towards the durable resolution of the conflict through stabilization and confidence-building in this particular region of the world  the Southern Caucasus.  The same task is even more demanding in Afghanistan  a country where the situation is still precarious. It is clear to us that  without security  Afghanistan will not  and indeed cannot  develop. Equally  however  we need economic development in order to improve the security situation and to encourage people to reject fundamentalism and terror.  We have achieved much together in recent months and years. Millions of children — many of them girls — are going to school again  while streets  bridges and hospitals are being built. The training and build-up of the Afghan police force and army are progressing. Compared to the deteriorating security situation  however  they are not progressing fast enough  especially in the present situation. Germany intends to do even more in the future.  However  we cannot afford to look at Afghanistan by itself. We need to step up our efforts to help Pakistan master the economic and social challenges it faces. Pakistan’s internal stability is crucial to stability in the entire region. This will require concrete support from everyone in the international community  and my country — rest assured — will play its part.  International engagement is also still necessary in the Middle East. In the current phase of domestic uncertainty  we call upon all parties to the conflict not to ease up in their efforts to resolve the conflict. As experience has shown  to stand still in the Middle East often means to take a step backward. A new wave of terror and violent clashes would result  and neither Israel nor Palestine  nor the international community  can afford to let that happen.  Germany believes it has a particular responsibility to provide concrete assistance to improve the framework conditions. Just recently  at the Berlin Conference in Support of Palestinian Civil Security and the Rule of Law — which many of those here attended — we agreed on concrete measures to strengthen the Palestinian security sector. Those measures are already having an impact.  An Iran armed with nuclear weapons would pose a threat to security throughout the Middle East and would trigger a nuclear arms race. Therefore  Iran must put its cards on the table. We have made our offer     08-52265 48  which is a tangible solution. The delaying tactics of the Iranian side must not exhaust the patience of the international community. We expect a clear signal from Iran indicating its willingness to comply with the international community’s demands and to build confidence. And let me make the following very clear: the Iranian President’s remarks concerning Israel are irresponsible and unacceptable. In my view  the blatant anti-Semitism that he expressed in his statement once again this year (see ) is outrageous and should be condemned by all of us. We must stand together on that issue.  The problems in Georgia  Afghanistan  Pakistan and the Middle East highlight one fact: it is more urgent than ever that we develop the foundations for a stable world order. My country stands for dialogue and the reconciliation of interests. That does not mean dialogue for the sake of discussion  without any results; nor does reconciliation of interests imply that we are prepared to abandon our own principles. We believe that it is essential to renounce violence  ensure fairness and recognize international law.   For us  that is the alternative vision to a world of fabricated opposing interests  the bloc mentality and oversimplified categories such as good and evil. East against West  North against South — that is yesterday’s thinking  and it no longer has a place in today’s world. In order to resolve the problems of today and tomorrow  we all need more partners  not more opponents. The twenty-first century is the first in which we can resolve problems only if we work together.  The same applies to disarmament policy. Only a partnership of shared global responsibility can achieve lasting results. The dangerous trend in which an ever-increasing number of countries strive to gain access to nuclear technology  or even to build nuclear weapons  must be stopped. My proposal to multilateralize the fuel cycle showed how those risks can at the very least be minimized. Furthermore  I call upon all States to sign the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty  because its entry into force would mean a huge gain in security.  For all that  however  we must remember that more people die every day as a result of hunger than as a result of war. The pledges that we made at the turn of the millennium must not remain a mere piece of paper. The fight against hunger and poverty is also part of a global responsibility partnership. Germany will therefore step up its efforts to promote poverty reduction and global fairness. As part of those efforts  we will increase our official development assistance contributions in accordance with the plan of the European Union. In the next budget alone  we will increase development assistance by $1.2 billion.   In that connection  I would like to say something about Africa. For too long  we have perceived that part of the world only as a continent of wars and conflicts. However  I also know an Africa that has set off on the road to the future with courage and resolve. It deserves our partnership and support along that road.  At present  the headlines are dominated by the international financial crisis. Recklessness  greed and a lack of common sense among those involved has set us back years. The long-term consequences cannot be assessed yet. However  I am certain that the painful tremors on the world financial markets will accelerate the multipolarization of the international financial system. There can be no future without rules  and no single player will be able to lay down those rules. It will no longer be possible for any one country to act as if it were immune to undesirable developments. Europe  with its tried-and-tested policy of mediation and reconciliation of interests  could play a key role in this.  Together  we must now finally ensure long-overdue transparency  stability and provisions to guard against risks on the world financial markets  along with oversight. My country developed concrete proposals in that regard a few years ago. I hope that  in the face of this deep crisis  the international community will now act quickly and with resolve. We need universal rules for the international financial markets.  That does not apply only to the international financial sphere  however; clear rules  solid structures and joint action are the vital prerequisites for meeting global challenges. That is why we need a strong and effective United Nations that enjoys the confidence of the international community  has the requisite legitimacy and can be the umbrella for a global responsibility partnership.  We therefore support the process of reforming the United Nations and its organs. Security Council reform is overdue  as we are all aware. The Council’s composition must reflect the realities of world politics today. Germany is prepared to shoulder greater   49 08-52265  responsibility in that area. Less than two weeks ago  the General Assembly unanimously decided to begin the negotiations on reform soon (see decision 62/557). That important step must now be followed by others. Germany is firmly convinced that  in the twenty-first century  we need the United Nations more urgently than ever before. "
"46",1928,"DMA",63,2008,"On behalf of my delegation and the Government and the people of the Commonwealth of Dominica  I would like to   29 08-52265  congratulate the President on his election to preside over the sixty-third session of the General Assembly. We are especially pleased that  for the first time  a national of Nicaragua is presiding over this body. Let me assure him of my delegation’s fullest cooperation.  We are meeting at a time of great international uncertainty. It stems from various global crises related to the availability and affordability of food  an increasingly unstable international financial system and volatility in the supply and cost of energy. In a statement to the High-level Segment of the Economic and Social Council last July  China and the Group of 77 commented on the predicament currently facing the world. They observed  quite rightly  that it was  “driven significantly by a severely unbalanced… economic system  made even more unbalanced by speculation; a climate … and environmental crisis; as well as a crisis of confidence in international institutions that were created to provide policy advice and coordination on global issues.”    Mr. Siles Alvarado (Bolivia)  Vice-President  took the Chair.   Today we endure the consequences. For small and vulnerable States in the Caribbean  such as ours  globalization continues to significantly change the dynamics of economic survival and sustainability. Our efforts to diversify our economies  adjust to global developments and stay competitive represent a formidable undertaking. As small States  we increasingly feel we have fallen off the radar screen of developed countries  which seem inconsiderate of our plight  especially in the key areas of trade and financing for development.  We keep hearing about a need for change. Indeed  around the world  change is being proffered as the panacea to all challenges and problems facing humankind. When everything else has failed  change  it would appear  becomes the only answer. As one of the youngest heads of Government who will address the General Assembly  I believe I have a duty to communicate to the world body that the word “change” is beginning to ring hollow with young people around the world.  Over the past decade  many countries have taken steps to effect change  as recommended. Sadly  in far too many instances  things have remained pretty much the same. What is really needed is meaningful change and a greater global commitment to making that change happen. When I speak of meaningful change  I mean change that goes beyond lip service and makes a noticeable difference in the lives of entire populations. Many countries cannot achieve such change alone. They need vital support from countries with advanced economies.  Four years ago  when I addressed this body  I appealed for meaningful structures to be instituted to minimize the suffering and harmful effects of natural disasters on small developing nations in particular. I am disappointed that no real progress has been made. Today  I address the Assembly against the backdrop of hundreds of fatalities and thousands of casualties from what so far has been a very active 2008 Atlantic hurricane season. Besides the loss of lives and personal injuries  natural disasters have inflicted billions of dollars worth of damage on small developing States. Most of those States are incapable of starting any short- or medium-term recovery programme on their own because of their limited resources.  Compare their plight with that of some developed countries where regions have been similarly devastated by hurricanes  earthquakes and mudslides. Those regions have been declared disaster areas and national resources have been mobilized to build and rebuild in record time  in some instances better than before. Let us compare the cases of two small countries: Haiti  in the Caribbean  less than four hours away from where we are meeting in the commercial capital of the world  and Georgia  on the Black Sea coast. Soon after the Georgia crisis  the United States Administration announced a $1 billion reconstruction package for Georgia  pledging that $500 million of that package was to be delivered by December of this year. That is commendable indeed; but what of Haiti?  That Caribbean country just south of the Florida keys is the poorest country in the western hemisphere. It is virtually a ward of the United Nations and the Organization of American States. It was devastated by the two worst hurricanes of this season — Gustav and Ike. We saw heart-wrenching images of women and children who had lost everything  caught in razor wire as they fought each other for inadequate relief supplies. What is the response of the United States Administration  the United States Congress and the United States presidential campaigns to the devastation in Haiti? What is the response of Canada and the    08-52265 30  European Union? Where is the billion-dollar reconstruction package for the people and Government of Haiti?  We  the international community  are in Haiti. The United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti has been in the country for over three years now  and has done a commendable job to help to restore the democratic  social and economic institutions of Haiti. But we know what is needed to bring about real and meaningful change  in the quality of life of the more than 8 million people of that great country of Haiti. Yet  we shrink from committing the resources and programmes needed to achieve those results. We are providing life support to Haiti  not support for recovery and reconstruction. My question is: Why is the response to devastation in Georgia so different to our response to devastation in Haiti?  In the international financial markets  turbulence of unprecedented and horrific proportions has taken place. The last fortnight alone has broken decades-old records for corporate closures  collapses and job losses. The effects of those events will be felt equally  and perhaps even more severely  in small developing countries such as those in Latin America and the Caribbean.  I speak today as the leader of a small developing island State whose economy was effectively paralyzed due to a series of decisions taken by representatives of developed nations and multilateral agencies who seemed totally unmindful of or indifferent to the impact of such actions on small and vulnerable economies. In 2002 and 2003  the Commonwealth of Dominica suffered one of the worst economic crises in its history. That was due in part to the deteriorating fortunes of the banana industry  precipitated by a United States of America-supported challenge to the European Union banana import regime before the World Trade Organization. What might have been an academic argument for some became an issue of survival for us.  There is no country in the world that has been more dependent on banana exports than Dominica. That fact meant nothing to those who engineered the near-demise of the industry in the Caribbean members of the African  Caribbean and Pacific Group of States as they put the WTO mechanisms to work to their benefit. The result was severe economic crisis and hardship  from which our farmers are yet to recover. I briefly recall those dire circumstances to emphasize the resolve  resilience and determination of our people  as well as what may be described as the insensitivity or indifference of others to the plight of small developing Member nations.  The meaningful change of which I speak and for which our populations yearn must be reflected in our attitudes and approaches to each other. Why speak of and proffer change if our attitude to the issue of the fundamental differences between nations — small and large  rich and poor — remains the same?  I think here of the issue of climate change. The fourth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found that sea-level rise caused by global warming is likely to exacerbate storm surges and coastal erosion on small islands. What that means for us is severe damage to the infrastructure of human settlements  including contamination of fresh-water supplies and agricultural lands and the pollution of marine eco-systems caused by the indiscreet and unsustainable practices of others.  Why speak of change if industrialized nations  in particular  refuse to heed the warnings and show greater commitment to saving the planet and reversing climate change? Meaningful change should quicken the pace of the climate change negotiations at Poznan  Poland later this year  with the objective of providing a realistic and attainable framework for the 2009 agreement in Copenhagen.  Change ought not merely to be a slogan or an excuse for inaction. Let me reaffirm that change can be real and meaningful.  Take  for example  the response of the nations in the Caribbean and Central America to the global energy crisis. As expected  the surging price of oil has adversely impacted the economies of the small island States of the Caribbean. To address the energy crisis in the region  the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela came up with an innovative initiative known as Petrocaribe in 2005. That initiative supplies fuel through a flexible payment facility to some 18 net oil-importing countries in the Caribbean and Central America. Petrocaribe also makes provisions to guarantee regional energy sovereignty by establishing an energy security arrangement through providing a reliable and timely supply of oil from Venezuela and increasing fuel storage capacity in the Caribbean.   31 08-52265   Since the volatility in oil prices has placed national balance of payments and foreign exchange reserves at risk  the Petrocaribe pact has taken on increased economic importance as a critical lifeline for many developing economies of the Caribbean and Central America. The initiative has become the single largest source of concessionary finance to the Caribbean region  with credits to importing countries from June 2005 to December 2007 amounting to some $1.17 billion. In contrast  traditional donors and multilateral assistance during the period in question amounted to approximately one quarter of the Petrocaribe figure.  The Commonwealth of Dominica joins with other countries of our hemisphere in expressing our appreciation to Government of Venezuela for the Petrocaribe initiative. We also applaud the Government of Trinidad and Tobago for establishing in 2004 a Special Petroleum Fund for member States of the Caribbean Community  which has provided timely grant funding to meet general development objectives.  Those two initiatives by the petroleum-exporting States of Venezuela and Trinidad and Tobago are shining examples of South-South cooperation and are deserving of emulation by other oil-producing States. They demonstrate that meaningful change  if earnestly pursued  can make a difference in the lives of the small and most vulnerable.  The global crisis in the availability and price of food presents yet another unprecedented challenge to developing countries. It is another area where meaningful change can make a difference.   Reports by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  which have helped to underscore the gravity of the problem. One states that “World food prices have roughly doubled over the past three years  but between April 2007 and April 2008 alone they increased by 85 per cent.”  Of particular concern is the price of rice  a staple for many people in the developing world. The price of rice has trebled since September 2007  rising by some 160 per cent just within the first quarter of this year. We concur with the views of the Secretary-General about the worsening food crisis  which could push an additional 10 million people into hunger and poverty  over and above the existing 800 million.  We endorse the Secretary-General’s conclusion that the crisis is a moral outrage  as well as his concern that the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) is threatened by the double jeopardy of high food and fuel prices.  All of that calls for meaningful change — change in attitude and change in practice. The people we are elected to serve are committed to and long for that change. They have mandated us to make the necessary change. The question is  are we so committed? Are we ready? Are we going to agree to and effect meaningful change?  That  for many  is what the sixty-third session of the General Assembly is all about: meaningful change for the good of all  meaningful change that will make a difference  meaningful change that will transform lives  meaningful change that will replace talk with action. For many small island States  securing a new global commitment to meaningful change will be the benchmark for judging the success of the session.  Let us therefore resolve at the sixty-third session of the General Assembly to effect the meaningful change that can make a difference in the lives of our peoples. Dominica stands ready to play its part. "
"47",1972,"DNK",63,2008,"My Government agrees entirely with the Secretary-General’s remarks at the opening of this debate. The world is on the eve of a great transition. The problems we face have grown much more complex  and our challenges are increasingly those of collaboration rather than confrontation. The quality of life in most parts of the world has improved tremendously over recent decades    39 08-53135  but challenges remain  not least in sub-Saharan Africa. New challenges  such as climate change  migration  increasing energy and food prices and financial instability  could all potentially give rise to embedded conflicts and further polarization.  As President Sarkozy said last week in his capacity as President of the European Union (EU)  continued reform of the United Nations is crucial to improving the ability of the United Nations to carry out its core business  which is and remains problem solving. We must continue the progress made on system-wide coherence and on the Delivering as One agenda. As regards Security Council reform  Denmark welcomes the agreement to initiate intergovernmental negotiations in the near future. At the election of Security Council members next month  Iceland is the candidate for membership representing all the Nordic countries. We are strongly backing Iceland’s candidature.  On climate change  the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports have served to crystallize an international consensus on the need for action. That consensus has been nurtured by the determined leadership of the Secretary-General  promoting global action to curb global warming  with the United Nations at its centre.  Economic growth and environmental protection are fully compatible. The challenge is to establish a framework for low-carbon growth  in which increased energy efficiency  increased use of renewable sources of energy  carbon capture and storage  and the development of a global carbon market are vital elements.  Denmark will host the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen in 2009. The goal is to reach an agreement on a successor to the Kyoto Protocol  making it an ambitious and truly global instrument. Momentum for a new comprehensive and ambitious international climate agreement is growing day by day.  During the past weeks  we have witnessed new cruel and meaningless acts of terrorism. The evil terrorist attack in Islamabad on the Marriott Hotel on 20 September resulted in the loss of many innocent lives. Most of those who died were Pakistanis  but other nationalities were also included  one Danish person among them. That attack and others came only a few weeks after United Nations Member States had reaffirmed their commitment to the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. We must respond to such despicable acts of fanaticism with great determination to strengthen international cooperation in that area. All United Nations bodies must join in the fight against terrorism. We hope that  at its present session  the General Assembly will finally agree to a comprehensive convention on international terrorism. In addition  we must focus on due process and sanctions  as it is becoming increasingly clear that a lack of adequate due process is hampering the efficiency of the sanctions system.  Sixty years after the adoption of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights  severe violations of human rights continue to take place. Extremists are trying to instigate a clash of civilizations by creating mistrust and polarization among various civilizations  cultures and religions. It is a major challenge for the United Nations to counter those trends and to promote the universality of human rights.  The number of armed conflicts is steadily decreasing. The United Nations has played a major role in ensuring that positive trend. However  several bloody and difficult conflicts remain high on the international agenda.  In Afghanistan  measurable progress has been made  but the security situation remains challenging. Corruption and drugs are undermining the achievements made and the long-term development of the country. Denmark has significantly increased its engagement in the United Nations-mandated  NATO-led mission  and we have doubled our development assistance to Afghanistan. Much has been achieved  but the United Nations needs to play a much stronger role in coordinating the international engagement. A lack of success in Afghanistan would have serious regional ramifications.  In Africa  the deployment of the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur has been delayed owing to various factors  including actions by the Government of the Sudan allowing attacks and killings to go on. Those responsible for the grave crimes committed in Darfur must be held accountable. Fighting impunity is a prerequisite for sustainable peace. We thus stress the need to comply with Security Council resolution 1593 (2005) and express our strong support for the International Criminal Court.     08-53135 40   In Zimbabwe  we hope that the power-sharing agreement will pave the way for durable peace and a return to democracy and rule of law  ending the suffering of the people of that country.   In Somalia  the international community is trying hard to improve the deplorable situation on the ground and the prospects for a long-term political solution. The scourge of piracy is one of the factors undermining stability in Somalia. The Danish navy is taking an active role  together with the navies of other nations  in addressing that problem off the coast of Somalia and in the region. We need to increase our common efforts to address all aspects of fighting piracy  including strengthening the international legal framework for handling detained persons. Through the Copenhagen Process Denmark has taken the lead on the broader issue of handling detainees in armed conflict. We believe that there are already valuable lessons here that can also be applied in relation to piracy.  In the Middle East  in spite of continuing violence  effective regional and international diplomacy has contributed to breaking the political deadlock in Lebanon. The Palestinians and the Israeli Government are also making progress. We urge the parties to the Middle East conflict to honour road map commitments and to settle their differences in accordance with the international agreements and the Arab peace initiative. I should also like to take this opportunity to strongly condemn the unacceptable remarks made by the President of Iran calling for Israel to be wiped off the map.  In Burma  Cyclone Nargis killed more than 100 000 people earlier this year. The slow and inadequate reaction of the regime demonstrated its disregard for the welfare of its own people. The United Nations is working hard to ensure the initiation of a genuine political dialogue between the Government and the political opposition as well as the release of all political prisoners  including Aung San Suu Kyi. We strongly support those efforts.  In August  war erupted in the South Caucasus. The conflict in Georgia has not only dramatically affected the region but clearly also entails repercussions that go beyond it. However  not least because of the European Union and its French presidency  the international community has been able to contribute constructively to the process. Now it is up to all parties to the conflict to fulfil the conditions set out in the six-point agreement and the Moscow agreement and to act in a positive spirit to find long-term solutions to the conflict in a peaceful manner that also respects Georgia’s independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity.  This year saw a new country appear in the Balkans. The United Nations has played a substantial role in promoting Kosovo’s development and is still present in Kosovo with the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK)  together with a new substantial contribution from the EU regarding the rule of law: the European Union Rule of Law Mission Kosovo. By reconfiguring UNMIK  the United Nations has demonstrated substantial pragmatism and a willingness to cooperate actively with the EU. Later this year  the United Nations is expected to hand over to the EU Mission tasks related to the rule-of-law area  and we welcome that development.  The good offices of the Secretary-General  the mediation and conflict prevention efforts of the United Nations and its peacekeeping operations  which now entail 19 missions and more than 130 000 staff members  remain the backbone of United Nations peace and security efforts. However  we need to improve the capacity of the United Nations system to assist countries in early phases of recovery after conflict as well as countries with very weak institutions that might easily fall into conflict. That means building a stronger bridge from humanitarian assistance  political good offices and peacekeeping efforts to early recovery  peacebuilding  reconstruction and transitional assistance aimed at sustaining State-building and preventing weak States from lapsing back into conflict or chaos. The creation of the Peacebuilding Commission and the Peacebuilding Fund was important in strengthening the Organization’s capacity and capability to build and cross that bridge  but so far it is only a footbridge. Much more engineering and craftsmanship are needed  including on the part of funds and programmes.  At the 2005 World Summit  the concept of the responsibility to protect was endorsed. We must develop that concept further and ensure that States do their utmost to protect their own citizens from genocide  war crimes  ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. We must discuss what the international community and the United Nations can do to assist States in meeting those obligations  and we   41 08-53135  must consider the means that are available to the international community when States manifestly fail to protect their populations.  Last week  an impressive number of heads of State and Government took part in the first high-level follow-up to the Millennium Declaration and the establishment of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). We are not on track  but we are not sidetracked either. We all have to make extra effort if we are to succeed  and we need to get our priorities right. A special focus on the empowerment of women is essential socially  politically and economically. Increased investments in women are crucial across all the MDGs  across all sectors. Gender equality is a basic human right  and it is smart economics  too. On that basis  the Danish Government has initiated a specific call to action on gender equality and the empowerment of women.  Another cross-cutting factor that might determine success or failure for all countries is governance. Political leadership  democratic institutions  the rule of law and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms are called for not only nationally  but also internationally. The international rule of law  with a strong emphasis on respect for the fundamental principles of international law  respect for human rights and fighting impunity  is a key to international peace and stability. The evidence is loud and clear  and we need to focus our efforts.  The evidence is equally loud and clear in another area. Sub-Saharan Africa is lagging behind in its trajectory towards achievement of the MDGs. The Danish Government has therefore established an international high-level commission on effective development cooperation with Africa. The aim of the commission  in which a number of African leaders and United Nations officials are taking part  is to present creative and concrete recommendations regarding a cross section of young people  employment and economic growth. By May 2009  the commission will present its ideas and concrete proposals on how African countries and the international community can address those challenges prior to the 2010 review of the status of the implementation of the MDGs.   In conclusion  let me reaffirm the interrelationship and interdependence of the issues that I have addressed. There can be no development without security and human rights  and vice versa. Progress is needed in all areas if we are to advance as a global community. And we must advance — in the area of development  in the area of peace and security  in the area of human rights and in the many areas that transcend borders. That can be achieved  however  only through multilateral cooperation in areas such as counter-terrorism  non-proliferation  pandemics and climate change. Multilateralism is our only response to the challenges  risks and opportunities of an interdependent and globalized world. It is our responsibility to ensure that the United Nations is properly equipped to address global challenges and global opportunities. "
"48",2017,"DOM",63,2008,"On behalf of the Government and people of the Dominican Republic  I am pleased to extend our warmest congratulations to the President of the General Assembly  Father Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann of the sister Republic of Nicaragua  on his recent election. We also take this opportunity to greet our fellow Member States in this General Assembly.   Eight years ago  in this same place  representatives of 189 countries undertook a crucial commitment  possibly one of the most transcendental commitments that such a large number of nations ever made. They agreed on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). In the year 2000  it was believed — and this is still the case today — that the objectives established at that time would go down in the common history of humankind as the bravest ethical decision ever taken in the face of extreme poverty  the shame of generalized injustice and the heartbreaking tragedy of social inequity. It was an agenda of work and dedication that required a large dose of political will  actions laid out in conformity with the goals to be reached  a reorganization of budgetary priorities and a   21 08-51749  greater flow of aid resources and support for development.   We did not undertake the Millennium Development Goals in vague terms. We did not couch the Millennium Declaration in abstract and grandiloquent concepts lacking in substance. Quite the contrary  we analysed with the greatest possible rigour the situation that we wanted to correct. We measured with mathematical precision its overwhelming scope and the magnitude of the political and financial effort that its reversal would require.   We committed to the MDGs with such supreme responsibility that we even set a date for their achievement: the year 2015. Now we are halfway to that date  and we face the disheartening situation of an international landscape full of obstacles to overcome if we are to conclude what we set out to do in the year 2000. We knew there would be difficulties. We recognized that we would have to overcome immense obstacles  and we had identified every type of major challenge that would await us in the quest to carry out our plans.   In the Dominican Republic  we have been able to achieve some progress towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. Since 1991  we have reduced by more than half the percentage of five-year-old children who are underweight for their age. We have also made progress in achieving our goals related to health development and have the spread of HIV/AIDS under control.   However  we now know that over and above the limited progress achieved  not just by the Dominican Republic but by developing countries on all continents  more than half a million women still die every year from complications of pregnancy and childbirth that could be treated and prevented. We now know that  unless an extraordinary effort is made from now on  instead of reaching the goal of reducing by half the proportion of children of low birth weight  their number will grow to over 30 million. We also know that in 2006  the number of deaths caused by AIDS rose to almost 3 million and that the preventive measures against that ominous pandemic remain grossly insufficient. Also disheartening is the fact that more than 600 million people will not have better health services than the ones they currently have access to.   Now  at the same time that this is occurring  the richest nations  which committed to providing extraordinary official development assistance in order to achieve the Millennium Development Goals  have in general fallen short in carrying out their pledges. Only five of those nations — Norway  Sweden  the Netherlands  Denmark and Luxembourg — have honoured their commitments  making contributions equal to and in some cases greater than the 0.7 per cent of their gross national income established as appropriate by this world Organization.   Nonetheless  we can be sure that  in order to achieve the Millennium Development Goals  we will now require a financial rescue plan from the international community — in a sort of bailout  as it is referred to nowadays. According to studies by the World Bank  a yearly average of approximately $50 billion in foreign aid would be needed to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. That is to say that achieving the goals of improving the quality of life and dignity in the living conditions of the poorest nations of the world would require an international economic financing plan as bold and as urgent as that currently being undertaken to save Freddie Mac  Fannie Mae  Bear Stearns  Merrill Lynch  AIG and other financial institutions. In other words  over the next seven years  until 2015  the date established for the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals  according to the criteria of the World Bank  we would need $350 billion of foreign aid. That represents half of the amount that is being debated at this very moment in the United States Congress to save from bankruptcy the financial businesses of Wall Street responsible for their own failures.   The people of the world affected by hunger and misery are crying out to the international community to lend the same urgent attention to the resolution of their plight that has been given to efforts to rescue banking institutions on the brink of collapse. We cannot entertain the idea that rescuing the dignity of the world’s poor is less important or urgent as rescuing the institutions operating in the world’s most important financial centre.   We would like it to be clear that we have not come here to condemn anyone. We have not come to point a finger at any friendly nation that is a Member of the United Nations family. Rather  we wish to sound the alarm and be a voice that troubles the conscience and calls for a solution to a problem that affects all    08-51749 22  poor nations and is socially unjust and ethically unacceptable.   We would like to use this forum  however  to highlight other factors that hinder the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals and the progress of our nations. Such is the case  for example  of the unregulated speculation in the buying and selling of futures contracts for oil and food. There is no way to hide the fact that  without regulation  the futures markets are mechanisms that lend themselves through excessive speculation  fraud and manipulation to a distortion of the fundamental principles of economic activity. We do not question the fact that  with respect to the determination of oil prices  supply has not increased significantly while demand has increased; that there has been insufficient investment in new refineries in recent years; that there are geopolitical tensions in various parts of the world  or that the United States dollar has decreased in value. All of that is true.   What we do question  however  is the fact  that in just 12 months  the price of a barrel of oil rose from $70 to almost $150. In July  we were stupefied to see the price of a barrel of oil rise $10 in a single day. Just two days ago  while we were here in New York  we saw with great perplexity an increase of not just $10 but $25 per barrel in a single day. How can we explain that? Is it that suddenly  in just one day  the whole world increased its demand so abruptly  or did the world’s oil wells unexpectedly disappear?  In reality  there is but one explanation: excessive speculation in the futures markets. It is incomprehensible that some can sell something they do not have while others can buy what they do not expect to receive. However  that is what has been happening recently  in the clearest example of so-called casino capitalism.  In just five years  hundreds of billions of dollars have entered the commodities futures markets  largely directed towards energy  while prices shot up by more than 200 per cent between July 2003 and July 2008. That has occurred not just with a few commodities  but with every single one of the 25 products on the world market index for commodities. In the past five years  the price of wheat has gone up by 177 per cent  soy by 196 per cent and corn by 214 per cent.   Nevertheless  we must reiterate here that what has the greatest impact on the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals is skyrocketing oil prices. In the Dominican Republic  our oil bill has risen from $1.667 billion in 2004 to a projected $6.5 billion this year. That represents a difference of almost 500 per cent. With that difference of $5 billion  the Dominican Republic could have financed every public investment laid out in the cost analyses of the Millennium Development Goals from 2008 to 2015.  The world does not aspire to be a gambling den. The world does not want continuous manipulation or permanent fraud in regard to factors that have a decisive effect on the quality of life. The world  in fact  has very simple aspirations: to live in conditions of social justice and equity  with the creation of opportunities so that every human being can develop his or her creative potential  both material and spiritual.  For the achievement of such noble objectives  the States that have committed themselves to realizing the MDGs as an agenda of true and genuine social transformation turn to the United Nations system with optimism and hope that it can correct and make up for existing distortions.  We trust that with so many intelligent persons meeting here  working towards a better life for all of humankind  important solutions will be brought to the table with the same speed  urgency and interest that are being shown in drawing up rescue plans for bankrupt banks during these turbulent times in the world of finance. "
"49",2064,"DZA",63,2008,"I wish at the outset to congratulate Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session. I also pay well-deserved tribute to his predecessor  Mr. Srgjan A/63/PV.13   08-53122 24  Kerim  and thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for the dignified  far-sighted and able manner in which he has carried out his heavy responsibilities since his election.  The central theme of this session and the subjects chosen for two high-level events are a perfect reflection of the international community’s current concerns. In recent months  the world has experienced crises that have revealed our collective vulnerability and our inability to confront those crises. As always  since the world order is based on that imbalance  the developing countries in particular pay the highest price by being powerless to meet the challenges that threaten their political stability and social cohesion.   The President returned to the Chair.  In that regard  the consequences of climate change and the food crisis caused by the scarcity and soaring prices of certain basic commodities have plunged millions of people into extreme poverty. International financial and economic institutions  whose mission it is to anticipate crises and alert the international community to their potential risk  must play their proper role by undertaking the needed reforms without requiring developing countries  in particular African countries  to abide by commitments incompatible with their development goals.   We must effectively and resolutely combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. We stress once again the importance and urgency of adopting a comprehensive counter-terrorism convention  while avoiding any provisions or stipulations that would prejudice the legitimate struggle of people to reclaim their freedom or of discrediting any particular religious community.   It is indispensable to continue the work of reforming the Organization so that it can become an instrument to promote freedom  democracy  justice  peace  security  development and progress. Such reform will be fruitful and promising only if it includes reform of the Security Council through the equitable expansion of its membership  the democratization of its decision-making processes and the improvement of its working methods.   Algeria’s actions in the geographical and political spheres to which it belongs are based on the principles of good-neighbourliness  cooperation and solidarity. In the Arab Maghreb  Algeria is working to ease the difficulties we are experiencing  which have hindered the re-launching of the Arab Maghreb Union  in the conviction that the destiny of our peoples and the requirements of our times demand the advent of a united and prosperous Maghreb. We are  however  keen to ensure that efforts in that regard do not meet with new disappointments  and we therefore think that that re-launching must be undertaken on a sound  solid and lasting basis that takes into account the enlightened self-interest of all the peoples of the region.  Inspired by its faith in that ideal of the Maghreb  Algeria has sincerely supported and will continue to support efforts to find a just  lasting and internationally legitimate solution to the conflict in Western Sahara that will allow the Saharawi people to exercise freely and transparently their inalienable right to self-determination. That is why Algeria believes it vital that the momentum created by the Manhasset process be preserved and encouraged. We cannot overstress the responsibility of all the parties. We have made an urgent appeal to the Secretary-General to participate in actions to remove obstacles to the negotiating process and to bring about conditions that will permit the holding of the fifth round of the process as soon as possible  as required by the relevant resolutions of the Security Council. Algeria  for its part  will continue to assume fully the role dictated by its status as a neighbourly country and an observer of the process.  On the Middle East  Algeria is pleased to note the positive developments in Lebanon and encourages all parties to persevere on the path of unity and national reconciliation. It is obvious that the Middle East will know no peace without a settlement of the Palestinian question  which is at the core of the Israeli-Arab conflict. There is no need for me to remind the Assembly that the advent of a just  comprehensive and lasting peace in the Middle East will inevitably require restoring to the Palestinian people their national and historic rights  including their right to an independent State  with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital  the return of refugees and the restoration of all the other Arab territories occupied by Israel. On that basis  we appeal to the international community to fully shoulder its responsibilities towards the Palestinian people  to support their just cause politically and to step up its humanitarian assistance in order to ease their suffering.   The African continent has been experiencing profound and promising changes. Undeniably  it is in the field of peace that the continent’s achievements  A/63/PV.13 25 08-53122  have been the most remarkable. Thus  the African Union and other regional organizations have become respected and necessary partners  particularly in preventing and settling African crises. Algeria welcomes these positive trends. We regret  however  that the support and commitment of Africa’s partners remain below the agreed objectives  both with respect to restoring peace and to economic and social development programmes.   We believe it is of the greatest importance to refrain from any action likely to thwart current peace efforts or to undermine the unity  territorial integrity and sovereignty of the Sudan. We must therefore mobilize the international community to promote the political process  which remains the only way to ensure that the Sudanese people can benefit from the restoration of peace and national reconciliation. In that regard  we reiterate our support for the efforts and proposals of the League of Arab States  the African Union  the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the Non-Aligned Movement  calling on the Security Council to freeze the decision of the Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court and to promote and consolidate the dynamics of peace and national reconciliation.   Similarly  with regard to the situation in Zimbabwe  Algeria can only welcome the approach adopted by the African Union and the Southern African Development Community to enable the people of Zimbabwe to overcome their current difficulties.   We are solidly behind Africa’s efforts to settle the Somali crisis by means of unreserved support for the political process and the dispatch of a peace mission to help the transitional authorities to restore peace and security in the country.   There is no way to overcome the dangers to peace and harmony in the world other than concerted efforts and consultations on the basis of a renewed equitable and effective multilateral system that places the non-discriminatory fulfilment of human needs and the preservation of human dignity at the heart of its concerns. From that standpoint  the fight against all the ills that afflict large swathes of humankind — whether extreme poverty  endemic disease  environmental problems or clandestine immigration — can be won only if we all  and in particular the developed countries  join our efforts. The two high-level meetings during this session  and others to be held over the next few months will undeniably test our capacity to respond collectively and solidly to the challenges of our time. "
"50",2111,"ECU",63,2008,"I am highly honoured to address the Assembly on behalf of the Government of the citizen revolution  of the President of Ecuador  Rafael Correa Delgado  and of the people of Ecuador at these paradoxical times of both crisis and hope.  Allow me to convey the fraternal greetings of the people and the Government of Ecuador to you  Sir — President of the Assembly and former Minister of Foreign Affairs of Nicaragua  Father Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann — on your election to such an important position. We agree with you on the need to attach the highest priority to the fight to eradicate poverty and to pay special attention to relevant issues such as climate change  the energy and food crises  human rights  disarmament  the rights of women and children and the preservation of cultural and biodiversity.  With the end of the cold war  we believed  not without reason  that the confrontation between two ways of life and two great Powers would give way to the solution of the planet’s pressing economic and social problems. Two decades have elapsed since that historic date  and we see with concern that that crisis has deepened  that social cohesion is harder to obtain  that new threats to security have intensified  and that the use of force and the number of conflicts have increased.  My country is convinced that the strengthening of the multilateral system is an imperative in the world of today. We have no other option to guarantee peace and security in the world than to renew our political decision to progress in the reform of the United Nations system  and in particular of the Security Council. This year  we have taken a significant step in that direction with the General Assembly’s adoption of decision 62/557  which provides a general framework to advance these negotiations. Let us hope that we make progress.  The debate on the need to increase membership of the Security Council and to democratize the Council and make its working methods more transparent and inclusive is undoubtedly one of the fundamental elements of the reform process. However  at the same time  we should not forget that another of the central points required to give back to the United Nations the role that it should have is to strengthen its democratic and representative organ par excellence  namely the General Assembly.  Nor should we forget that any process of reform will be incomplete if it does not include the democratization of the organizations that make up the United Nations system. In the twenty-first century we cannot continue working with a system in which most countries cannot access the decision-making bodies    08-53135 36  because of structures that respond to the special circumstances that prevailed when those bodies were created. We need to urgently build a multilateral system that responds promptly and effectively to today’s challenges and that recognizes the fundamental principles of international law  such as the sovereign equality of States. Only with thorough-going reform can the United Nations regain the lead role that it should play in international affairs.  We cannot understand that States Members of this Organization continue supporting peacekeeping budgets of billions of dollars and yet have serious concerns about increasing budgets for development programmes  especially fundamentally important programmes to fight poverty  HIV/AIDS  malaria and the effects of climate change. Our citizens are beginning to call us to account with regard to the resources that we contribute annually to this Organization and the results that we obtain. That is why we consider positive the proposal stressed by the President of the General Assembly to commence a truly thorough and democratic reform of this Organization.  To work for development and the reduction of poverty and to deal adequately with the needs of millions of human beings who are struggling today in misery  disease and despair  is an absolute requirement in order to guarantee peace and security. Therefore  my country assigns high priority to economic and social policies aimed at overcoming unequal distribution of income and employment  and at guaranteeing the right of its population to health  education and social security. These efforts must be accompanied by decisive and effective support from developed countries  through a substantial increase in official development assistance (ODA) — cooperation that cannot be subject to conditions of any kind and that must supplement national efforts based on sovereign development policies.  There is still much to do  however  if we are to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). As we have stated in several forums  Ecuador considers that the MDGs are basic minima for survival and that we should go beyond them. In our country  we have left behind an outdated concept based on market growth indices and are currently working actively and with impressive results on increasing the quality of life of the citizens of Ecuador. We call this concept of “buen vivir” — “living well” — which means living with dignity and in accordance with our cultural values and in harmony with nature.  Ecuador and  I am sure  all developing countries hope that the Doha Conference on Financing for Development will produce positive results for our countries  such as access to external financing for development  relief of the external debt servicing burden  the reform of international financial institutions and the effective alignment of official development assistance with the national strategies and policies adopted by sovereign countries  together with the strong commitment of donor countries to allocate at least 0.7 per cent of their gross domestic product (GDP) to official development assistance. Middle-income countries deserve special attention since they account for more than 41 per cent of the poor of the planet.  The United Nations should actively promote South-South cooperation. We believe that the High-level United Nations Conference on South-South Cooperation to be convened by the General Assembly in 2009 is evidence of the role which the Organization should play in this area. It will constitute an excellent opportunity to strengthen and enhance this important cooperation.  Likewise  it is necessary that there be a special place for economic and social development in the work of the United Nations. Without a total fulfilment of the commitments that have been undertaken and without a true inclusion of our needs based on our own agendas for development  we cannot talk of international peace and security.  Ecuador wishes to highlight  at this juncture  the vital role that the Group of 77 and China and the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) have to play on these and other issues. During the last NAM ministerial meeting  held in Tehran  Iran  in July  we reiterated our conviction that this important mechanism of political agreement is central in ensuring that our countries’ interests are fully taken into account.  Ecuador also assigns importance to the role of the United Nations in establishing a world order based on respect for international law  the norms and principles set out in the Charter  and the promotion of and respect for human rights international humanitarian Law.  My country supports the actions the United Nations is taking to address the serious security   37 08-53135  problems we face  such as the fight against terrorism  the worldwide drug problem and the fight against transnational organized crime. Accordingly  we welcomed the recent positive outcome of the first review of progress in the implementation of the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. My country will continue to give its support to these important initiatives.  Ecuador also supports negotiations aimed at the eventual adoption of a legally binding convention on terrorism. However  we believe that  given the vitally important implications of the issue  such a convention should expressly and unequivocally cover the obligations of all States to fight terrorism in the framework of international law  human rights  international humanitarian law and the principles and norms established in the Charter of the United Nations.  The fight against terrorism cannot be an excuse for some States to feel released from their obligation to respect fundamental norms of international law  such as respect for the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of other States and non-intervention in their internal affairs. Likewise  the violation of the human rights of alleged terrorists — who have been tortured  incarcerated in clandestine military prisons and deprived of the basic right to defend themselves — also constitutes a very serious precedent. These practices must be condemned by the international community. Sovereignty  the inviolability of territory  the non-use of force and non-intervention in the affairs of other States are the only guarantee for peaceful coexistence among the peoples of the world.  Ecuador assigns high priority to the actions of the international community to ensure that States comply in good faith with their human rights obligations. We believe that the Human Rights Council  which is consolidating its position as the best mechanism for the preservation and protection of human rights  has substantially improved its working methods. But all countries must make an effort to set aside their political objectives to allow the Council to effectively fulfil the purposes for which it was created.  Ecuador feels that the Universal Periodic Review system established by the Council is a good step in that direction. For this reason  my country was glad to be the second country in the world to submit its review  in April 2008. On that occasion  we reiterated our unfailing commitment to respect for and protection of human rights. We were able to share with the international community the substantial advances made in the implementation of our national human rights plan  and we voluntarily made additional commitments.  The adoption of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples was a milestone. My country was actively involved in the negotiation of that important instrument and is now committed to its implementation and follow-up in order to contribute to national policies aimed at consolidating the identity  culture and effective exercise of the political  economic and cultural rights of the indigenous peoples and nationalities of Ecuador.  The issue of migration is of singular importance to my country. The Government of Ecuador is therefore implementing a comprehensive immigration policy  contained in the National Human Development Plan for Migration  that includes programmes  projects and actions aimed at guaranteeing the protection and a comprehensive approach to migration issues and of migrant persons  regardless of their origin or administrative status within the territory of a State.  The free movement of persons is a right that must be protected  and I believe that no Government represented here is opposed to that. However  the regulation of such movement must be in strict accordance with the principles of international humanitarian law and the human rights of migrants. In the words of the President of my country  Rafael Correa Delgado  “there are no illegal human beings  only practices that violate the rights of persons”. In that respect  we are deeply disturbed by the return directive issued by the European Union. We believe that  today more than ever before  our countries must join together to demand effective compliance with the obligations arising from international human rights and on migration agreements. Emigration and return must both be an expression of freedom.  The new Constitution of Ecuador establishes the principle of universal citizenship  the free movement of all peoples on Earth  and a progressive end to the concept of “foreignness” in order to transform unequal relations between countries  especially between the North and the South. We must not forget that migration is often a direct consequence of economic models based on exclusion  in which the market  the accumulation of wealth and selfishness paper over the true needs of human beings.    08-53135 38   As I said  humanism and solidarity are fundamental principles that guide the actions of the Government of Ecuador. That is why my country adopted a State policy on refugees on 16 September of this year. That policy is aimed at providing comprehensive assistance to persons placed under the protection of Ecuador.  We will honour all our national and international commitments regarding refuge seekers  but we need the determined cooperation of the international community. We must not forget that Ecuador is currently the country with the largest number of persons in need of international protection in the entire western hemisphere. According to studies conducted by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees  there are approximately 200 000 Colombian citizens in need of international protection within the territory of Ecuador. Ecuador is now implementing a process of extended registration  which will benefit thousands of Colombian brothers in urgent need of international protection.  The severity of the world food crisis is an issue that our countries must address in a comprehensive manner while taking all of its dimensions into account. In that respect  Ecuador believes that subsidies and other trade distortions have a serious impact on the agricultural sectors of developing countries. For that reason  Ecuador firmly supports the proposal to hold a special session on that issue during the sixty-third session of the General Assembly.  In addition  Ecuador is compelled to highlight the current financial crisis  which also deserves our Organization’s particular attention. The crisis is further proof of the decline of our current economic system  which prioritizes speculative capital over productive capital  threatens the common good and endangers the development prospects of the majority of world. It is not a country-specific crisis  but a systemic crisis of capitalism that calls for profound and comprehensive responses.  Ecuador’s foreign policy reflects its firm commitment to disarmament and the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Ecuador has not only adhered to international instruments in that field  but also supports and carries out all the obligations emanating from those instruments in order to achieve their effective implementation. We are concerned by the fact that there are countries that  regrettably  have not adhered to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  while others that have adhered to it are not meeting their obligations  especially in terms of disarmament and the destruction of their arsenals. With regard to that policy issue  Ecuador welcomes the adoption  in Dublin in July  of the Convention on Cluster Munitions. My country will sign the Convention in a ceremony to be held in Oslo on 3 December 2008.  Other issues of great concern to my country include the fight against transnational organized crime and its ramifications  the production and illicit traffic of narcotics  corruption  the manufacturing and illicit traffic in small arms and light weapons  and human trafficking. We believe that the United Nations has taken decisive steps on those issues by adopting international conventions that allow for cooperation between our countries in the fight against those scourges. We believe that adequate and equitable international cooperation is essential. Such cooperation  as I said  must respond to the needs of our countries and be aimed at supporting national policies.  Ecuador is convinced that a strong and effective multilateral system is the only means for the world to overcome the problems it faces and  above all  to guarantee the well-being of peoples and international peace and security. It is therefore incumbent upon us to transform the United Nations.  To conclude  I have the pleasure of announcing to the world that Ecuador has made a new step towards the strengthening of our democracy. Yesterday  the Ecuadorian nation approved by an ample majority a new political Constitution — a new social pact based on a transformed relationship between the State  the economy and politics  creating a new model of development aimed at human welfare and harmony with nature.

"51",2156,"EGY",63,2008,"The sixty-third session of the General Assembly is taking place against the backdrop of various international and regional events and developments that are closely linked to the peace and security of all humankind. Among those are the global food crisis  the increase in energy prices  global warming and climate change and their negative and catastrophic repercussions for the entire world  the global economic downturn that is bordering on being a worldwide recession  the sharp global increase in poverty  our diminishing collective ability to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  the rising rate of infection with HIV  malaria and other deadly diseases  and the fight against terrorism. Egypt believes that all those challenges  as well as others  are high priorities on the international agenda. Their diagnosis and treatment require a concerted international effort. We must all be fully aware that jointly overcoming those problems depends upon our collective diagnosis and our united stand in addressing them.  We need a new approach  vision and methodology to deal with global problems. Unfortunately  the existing frameworks have proven incapable of dealing successfully and effectively with the challenges under consideration. As an example  Egypt believes that the global food and energy crises require serious dialogue between importers and exporters of energy and food. President Mubarak called for such a dialogue at the recent African Union Summit and at the Rome meeting of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).   The channels currently available for addressing and resolving the problems of food and energy are at odds with each another  to say nothing of the fact that none of them can provide for a genuine and meaningful dialogue between importers and exporters. It was for that reason that President Mubarak was keenly interested in participating effectively in the emergency summit convened by FAO  to which I have referred  on the question of the rising price and availability of foodstuffs.   Along the same lines  President Mubarak has strongly supported the African endeavour to adopt a clear strategy to tackle that phenomenon. In turn  that led to the adoption of the Sharm el-Sheikh declaration at the last African Union Summit  which contains Africa’s comprehensive vision for addressing the matter. Egypt has also supported the strategy put forward by the Secretary-General to deal with the issue. We have also called for utilizing that strategy as the basis for more effective international action.  In an effort to translate the growing international concern into an integrated plan of action to address that phenomenon  Chile  Indonesia and Egypt have proposed that that question and its repercussions should be a main theme at this session of the General Assembly. In that connection  I would like to thank the President for his positive response to our initiative and also for including the issue of strengthening international democratic action at the United Nations.  By the same token  urgently establishing collective international political will is necessary to deal with climate change. As one of the countries vulnerable to the repercussions of that phenomenon  Egypt is acutely aware of its gravity. While reiterating our full support for the Bali Plan of Action and Road Map  we call for focused international attention on the issue of categorizing low-lying coastlines  which applies to Egypt. A list of the States most vulnerable to climate change is needed so the United Nations and the international community can provide them with the necessary support as a matter of priority  including technological and financial support.  Based on our belief in globally addressing those urgent economic challenges  Egypt and Norway are facilitating the current negotiations at the United Nations on the final document of the Review Conference on the Implementation of the Monterrey Consensus on Financing for Development. The goal is to amend the international development agenda for the upcoming stage  while taking into consideration the  A/63/PV.13 9 08-53122  agreements reached in all the international meetings and conferences held thus far.  Egypt believes that using language that implies double standards is an affront to human rights. Despite the fact that everyone is adamant in declaring that human rights constitute an indivisible whole  the reality  which we need to change  is that economic  social and cultural rights are not  unfortunately  accorded the same attention as civil and political rights. That adversely affects public perception in many of our societies  in particular those that face dire  and occasionally destructive  economic and living conditions. For such people  talking incessantly about human rights is a luxury they cannot afford  and results in the neglect of their basic requirements for sustenance. The promotion of economic and social rights must therefore be viewed as crucial to strengthening the human rights regime  which is essential to promoting the awareness and practice of the components of that regime.  In that regard  I wish to discuss the important question of using the concept of freedom of expression to incite hatred based on religion. With the utmost respect for the value and importance of freedom of expression  I emphasize that we reject repeated affronts to religions and holy symbols being portrayed as a legitimate exercise of freedom of expression: there are many glaring slogans in whose name crimes have been committed against thousands and millions of people by offending them and their religious beliefs. Egypt calls upon everybody to consider this matter judiciously and objectively with a view to striking the proper balance that protects freedom of expression while respecting the rights and sentiments of all. Egypt will continue to seek such a balance  with the aim of reaching a consensus on the content of draft United Nations resolutions on this matter.  Here  I wish to convey to the Assembly that we are concerned by the unconstructive cultural friction that the world is witnessing  which causes severe divergence in opinion and action; this in turn inflames public emotions and increases the nature and severity of the polarization and confrontation between the followers of different cultures and creeds. This matter must not be ignored.  The international community’s approach to disarmament  arms control and non-proliferation is marred by defects  double standards and regression. This is a matter of concern for us. Egypt has always shown great interest in these matters  as best embodied in Egypt’s call to rid the Middle East of all weapons of mass destruction. Our interest in this matter is based on our unwavering belief that security and military balance  especially in conflict areas  contributes to laying solid foundations for peace between countries and peoples.  However  achieving genuine peace and security in any region requires  among other things  the establishment of just and parallel international and regional mechanisms in the areas of disarmament  arms control and non-proliferation. It is notable that  unfortunately  prominent members of the international community are unduly lax regarding Israel’s nuclear capability and the extent to which this constantly threatens the security of the Middle East. This occurs as attempts are being made to enhance the obligations included in international mechanisms without paying attention to the issue of achieving the universality of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and subjecting all nuclear facilities in the Middle East to the comprehensive safeguards system of the International Atomic Energy Agency.  Egypt will nonetheless persist in its endeavours  through existing mechanisms and forums and in coordination with friendly States that understand the reality and danger of the situation  in order to change it and to warn of the danger that failing to achieve universality for the NPT in the Middle East would entail.  In my statement today  I have given precedence to international over regional issues. This in no way diminishes the significance of crises  problems and difficulties at the regional level. Rather  it reaffirms the importance that Egypt attaches to the international situation and international problems in general.  At the regional level  as members know  Egypt is persistently involved in painstaking efforts to keep open a window of hope that would allow the Palestinians to achieve their legitimate ambition to gain an independent State on the Palestinian territories occupied on 5 June 1967  with East Jerusalem as its capital. The current situation  thanks to the efforts of the United States  might suggest to some that there is hope for a real settlement between the Israelis and Palestinians before the end of the year. However  through diligent monitoring of the situation  we A/63/PV.13   08-53122 10  understand that achieving a just and lasting settlement of the conflict — one that provides an opportunity to end Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territories and to bring about a Palestinian State — requires serious political will on the part of Israel. This must include the dismantlement of settlements in tandem with withdrawal from the land  and the restoration of Palestinian rights.  However  I must admit that we are sceptical about the strength of the will and conviction of Israeli decision makers. Hence the procrastination and setbacks  as well as the hesitation in settling issues. This is what leads to the widely condemned and politically loaded settlement activities  which clearly indicate the regression and weakness of the Israeli side’s will for peace. This is also the reason for the prolongation of the conflict  with its consequences that the whole world knows only too well. But we in Egypt will not lose hope; we will continue to work with everyone in order to achieve the objectives of justice  stability and security for the whole region.  The situation in the Sudan also remains disconcerting in the light of ongoing developments. We have observed numerous foreign hands interfering with Sudan’s security and stability  as if their objective were to drive that country towards partition. In this context  I would like to affirm that Egypt is working sincerely with all loyal Sudanese parties  at the forefront of them the Sudanese Government  in order to settle existing problems. Allow me to note  in particular  the situation in Darfur  which remains difficult  and the significant Egyptian participation in the United Nations peacekeeping force there  as well as our participation in all dialogue forums that aim to settle the crisis. I should also note our call for an international meeting to address the crisis and to agree on a road map to end it. Stability in the Sudan requires outside parties to refrain from interfering in Sudanese affairs  just as it requires support for the development process in that country. Egypt will continue its diligent efforts to achieve the interests of our brothers in the Sudan as well as the country’s and the region’s unity and stability.  In our region  the concept of regional security should be construed broadly  and the security of the Arab Gulf — which is currently in the international spotlight — is one of Egypt’s principal concerns  not only because of Egypt’s close relations with the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)  but also because of what Egypt represents in terms of strategic depth for its Arab brothers and sisters of the Gulf. Therefore  we follow closely all developments in the region  in particular the recurrent discourse about “new arrangements” there. We affirm that Egypt is working in coordination with members of the GCC with a view to protecting Arab national security and ensuring that any such arrangements — if they come into existence — will represent true security guarantees for all parties.  A great deal of work lies ahead of us at this session. This requires open minds and outstretched hands in order to meet the demands and aspirations of our peoples for freedom  justice  dignity  security and peace. Egypt will work throughout this session to advance the components of our vision for the international and regional situation  which I have just elucidated.  All of us bear the responsibility for this  just as we shall all bear the consequences and the results. We pledge to work with dedication and sincerity for a successful session under your able presidency  Sir. "
"52",2180,"ERI",63,2008,"I wish to take this opportunity to warmly congratulate Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session. He has the full support of my delegation  and I wish him every success as he guides the important deliberations of the session at this most critical time. I also wish to take this opportunity to express my delegation’s appreciation to his predecessor  Mr. Srgjan Kerim  who successfully presided over the General Assembly at its sixty-second session.  These are turbulent times indeed. The world today is not getting safer by any standard. Alas  there seems to be a vortex of perennial conflicts and crises. The fires in Afghanistan and Iraq have not been extinguished; to the contrary  they continue to smoulder and intensify  punctuated by misleading  short-lived lulls. The intractable conflict situations in the Middle East are not nearer to a solution today. In Somalia  humanitarian suffering of unparalleled magnitude continues to unfold  although it remains largely ignored by the international media. Furthermore  the war in Georgia  with its potential fallout for global polarization is symptomatic of  and underscores  the extremely fragile security environment that prevails in our troubled world today.  To add to that gloomy mix  the world is also witnessing volatile and speculative fluctuations in the price of fuel oil  an unprecedented hike in food prices and a recent spate of insolvency of financial corporations that in combination are driving the global economy towards recession. Rapid climatic changes resulting from progressive environmental degradation and the resulting spell of more frequent floods and droughts  as well as pandemics that are affecting millions of people  complete the grid of the immense challenges that our global community is facing today. These multifaceted problems stem from multiple causes.   At the same time  it cannot be denied that many of those problems have been exacerbated  if not instigated  by the misguided and domineering policies of the United States Government. Indeed  the fingerprints of the sole super-Power are discernible in most of the conflict situations that are raging in many parts of our globe  with the deleterious economic  financial and humanitarian ramifications that they invariably entail.  The perplexing feature of that overarching and negative development is the emergence of the concept of management by crisis as a new tool of policy promotion. These days  candid efforts are not exerted to prevent and manage conflicts. On the contrary  crises are deliberately spawned and allowed to fester and the resulting necessity for management then provides the United States with opportunity and latitude for control  in a situation of permanent instability. The absence of countervailing forces in a unipolar world has only aggravated the situation. Principal among those is the weakness of the United Nations in pursuing an independent line and acting as a bulwark of robust multilateralism.  The strong misgivings that I have expressed are attested to by the multiple situations of turbulence that continue to unfold in our part of the world. Allow me to illustrate this grim reality through a brief description of the causes and complications of such turbulence.  In the border war between Eritrea and Ethiopia  both parties had ultimately agreed to resolve the dispute through binding arbitration on the legal basis of the sanctity of the colonial boundaries. These are cardinal principles of international law enshrined in the United Nations Charter as well as in the Constitutive Act of the African Union. Furthermore  these commitments were solemnly enshrined in the Algiers Peace Agreement that was signed by the parties in December 2000. The Algiers Agreement was comprehensive in its details. Essentially  it had two components: first  confidence-building provisions and   15 08-53141  measures through the deployment of a modest United Nations peacekeeping force; and secondly  settlement of the border dispute through final and binding arbitration on the basis of the colonial treaties and international law.  As members know  the parties went through lengthy and meticulous legal litigation in The Hague in 2001. The Eritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission — a five-member arbitration panel of international jurists — announced its unanimous final and binding decision on 13 April 2002 and made serious efforts for five years  until the completion of its work in November 2007. From November 2007 onwards in particular  Ethiopia’s military presence on sovereign Eritrean territories has been one of blatant occupation. This is so because the Boundary Commission has decided to complete its demarcation functions — which were disrupted and held hostage by Ethiopia for five long years — through precise representation of the boundary by coordinates.  Throughout these years  Ethiopia’s reckless acts of destabilization and aggression were supported by the United States  and they continue to be. Throughout these years  the United States not only used its formidable clout in the United Nations system to forestall appropriate measures against Ethiopia pursuant to the Algiers Agreement and that were based on Chapter VII of the Charter  but it concocted various formulas — special envoys and extensions of the mandate of the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE)  among other things — of “management by crisis”  to perpetuate the conflict and derail enforcement of the Commission’s legal decision.  The tragedy in Somalia is another extremely grave humanitarian situation that has been exacerbated  if not brought about  essentially because of wrong United States policies. Half a million Somalis are today displaced and living in abysmal conditions mainly as a result of Ethiopia’s military invasion in 2007. Thousands of innocent civilians have been killed. United States warplanes occasionally pulverize Somali villages in the name of the war on terrorism.   Were these interventions legal or justified? The portrayal of Somalia and the Union of Islamic Courts (UIC) as the epicentre or hub of terrorism was neither true nor candid. Somalis should and could have been given a chance to sort out their own problems through the reconciliation processes that they had begun in earnest. But all of those efforts were nipped in the bud through a pre-emptive invasion by Ethiopia at the instigation of the United States that resulted in massive humanitarian tragedy that dwarfs other contemporary crises in Africa.  Nor is the situation in the Sudan any different  either. While the complexities of the long and varied conflicts cannot be downplayed  the fact remains that United States policy in the Sudan is driven by other objectives and considerations. The net outcome has been and remains an aggravation of the multiple problems there  whether in relation to the implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement between the North and South or with respect to the situation in Darfur.  Recently  the United States  which has a military base in Djibouti  has fabricated a new conflict situation between Djibouti and Eritrea to keep alive the hot spots of tension in the region. As I explained earlier  due to United States influence  the Security Council has been paralysed and rendered impotent in the face of Ethiopia’s occupation of sovereign Eritrean territories  including the town of Badme. At the same time  the United States doggedly tried to use the Security Council platform during its presidency last June to fabricate a non-existent problem and establish a case against Eritrea.  All those destabilizing acts are sometimes portrayed as unavoidable consequences or collateral damage of the war on terror. The fact is that the war on terror was derailed long ago from its original objectives and intentions in order to undermine and subvert forces and Governments that do not toe Washington’s line. Furthermore  the dragnet has been widely extended to involve the transparent interference of the United States in the subregional and regional organizations in our part of the world.  This untenable state of affairs cannot go on and should not be tolerated. The human sufferings have been and are too great  the time too long. Therefore  the collective international efforts to check United States excesses are timely and imperative — all the more so because those failures are widely recognized and acknowledged by significant segments of public opinion in the United States itself.  The perils of unchecked unipolarism have become glaringly obvious in the past few years. That reality can only accentuate the need to bolster the    08-53141 16  United Nations to make it a democratic and robust institution of multilateralism through prolonged and concerted collective efforts.  The need for prompt action requires great urgency  particularly in our region. For that to happen  first of all  illegal occupation of sovereign territories must be terminated and the rule of law and the Charter of the United Nations fully respected. Secondly  the invasion of Somalia must come to an end and the perpetrators of war crimes must be held accountable. Thirdly  the interferences in and complications of the problems in the Sudan must cease  and a conducive climate must be created to bring about a lasting solution. Lastly and most importantly  United States meddling in the affairs of the Horn of Africa region  which has invariably led to the instigation of crises  must be terminated.  The consequences of failing to act are dire indeed. Unless effective measures are taken to remedy the multiplying problems that our global community is confronting today  we run the risk of further widening and exacerbating them. The situation in the Horn of Africa may in fact spiral out of control unless those destabilizing practices are brought to an end.  In conclusion  I sincerely hope that our plea will be heeded so that further turmoil and suffering in our region may be avoided. "
"53",2226,"ESP",63,2008,"In a few weeks’ time  it will be 60 years since the proclamation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. And here we find ourselves at the midpoint in the application of our strategies for the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).  The Universal Declaration of Human Rights bears witness to the determination to leave us a better world than the one known by our fathers’ generation — a generation that suffered  struggled  defeated totalitarianism and condensed its aspirations for freedom and prosperity in that text. The Millennium Development Goals reflect the will  no less determined  of our generation to confront extreme poverty once and for all  so that we may leave to our    08-51851 24  children a world without millions of human beings suffering from hunger and poverty on a daily basis.  Together  the observance of human rights and the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals are perhaps the most noble aspirations ever envisioned by humanity  and the most devoted to the dignity of individuals.  Just by that fact alone  we can say that  despite all of the suffering deliberately caused by human beings over the last decades  during that time we have learned and we have made progress. We can feel satisfied that we have identified and broadened the horizons of human beings on our planet. We can feel satisfied by that  but by no means should we be complacent.  There is no room for complacency because if we look at the horizon for the MDGs  as we have for human rights  the conclusion would be the same: the results are still far from fulfilling our aspirations  precisely because those aspirations retain all of their value  and even grow in value  with the passage of time.  Ten years ago  at the commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  President Nelson Mandela recalled that poverty is an offence against the Declaration and is the result not of any force of nature  but rather of the action or non-action by human beings  in particular those in leadership positions in politics  the economy and other areas of human activity.  Aware of that responsibility  eight years ago Member States undertook the unique effort  in historic terms  to alleviate poverty for millions of people worldwide. I wish to make my opinion clear that we have not progressed as we should have or as we planned. However  the needs are the same or even greater than they were when we agreed the Millennium Development Goals eight years ago.  Mr. Tanin (Afghanistan)  Vice-President  took the Chair.  If we are to attain the Millennium Development Goals by 2015  we cannot just sit back. We cannot blame our failure to meet our obligations on the economic situation. We cannot use any circumstance as an excuse to avoid honouring our commitments. It is a question not only of adhering to irreplaceable ethical standards  but of making responsible efforts towards stability and international equality.  We must also work urgently to establish a new world financial order that would prevent the recurrence of situations like that we are currently experiencing. It is also urgent that we continue to fight with determination against the hunger and poverty that cause millions of people to suffer unacceptably and continue to be a source of conflict and migratory pressures that are difficult to control.  I am speaking on behalf of a country — Spain — that is making great efforts of solidarity in its cooperation policies. Over the past four years  Spain has been the State with the highest increase in its official development assistance; our goal is to reach 0.7 per cent of our gross national income by 2012. Spanish society offers that commitment in response to the current food crisis.  My country believes that the best way to reaffirm the full value of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and to keep 2015 firmly in view is to strengthen the historical connotation of each. That connotation is nothing less than the exaltation of human dignity as both an impregnable wall against arbitrariness and despotism and as a curb against extreme poverty.  A few weeks ago  on behalf of the Government of Spain  I made a proposal that I would like to reiterate today. The year 2015 should be designated as the year of a universal moratorium on the death penalty. That would be a first step towards its abolition. I call upon representatives of countries that still include capital punishment in their legal system to support the measure and to participate in a process of reflection on the meaning of that punishment inflicted by States. It might seen utopian to aspire to achieve the full enjoyment and universal recognition of human rights and the eradication of extreme poverty in the course of a single generation  but those goals are not utopian and never will be. Utopias are often simply premature truths. We must not delay or dismiss them with resignation or blind selfishness. Moreover  it is only by setting off down that road that we can work towards the just  secure and cooperative international order that we all wish to see.  The effects of the international financial crisis that began one year ago are spreading throughout most developed and less developed economies  and could affect the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. There is a risk that the poorest countries will end up suffering even more because of improper   25 08-51851  practices in the richer countries. The financial crisis has conclusively demonstrated the need to reconsider economic environments that are immune to regulation and governmental supervision. We already know what speculation in the crucible of deregulation can lead to. Today  it is more important than ever to stress the role of institutions and Government in rationalizing the markets and their instrumentality in serving the real needs of families  the well-being of individuals and their education  health care and social cohesion.   At the national level  the State protects markets from their own excesses. The global market lacks similar institutions to develop control and supervision functions. We need to revise the rules and institutions of the world economy. We need a common vision for the establishment of a new international financial legal system. We have to learn from our mistakes  and do so quickly and in a spirit of cooperation.  My Government would like to contribute actively to forging that new international financial order. We will promote and support an agreement that contains definite commitments to supervision  transparency and early warning by national institutions; ensures the flexible capacity of those institutions to provide liquidity and countercyclical reserves of capital to the markets in moments of need; and strengthens the role of international financial bodies.  Prosperity for our peoples is possible only if there is international peace and security. Peace and security will be possible only through effective multilateralism based on respect for and the safeguarding of international law. For my country  there is no other way to imagine international order. Four years ago in this very same Hall  I proposed an alliance of civilizations with the objective of building bridges between different cultures and breaking down the walls of misunderstanding. Today  I am satisfied to note that the initiative promoted by Spain and Turkey has been fully endorsed by the United Nations  and enjoys the support of a Group of Friends made up of 90 States and international organizations.  The world can hope for peace only when dialogue and understanding of basic values that respect diversity are elevated above intolerance and fundamentalism.   Spain will continue to assert this conviction in all forums where our contribution is or can be relevant — including  first and foremost  at the United Nations. We will do so not only because it is the best way to stress the key desires of Spanish society  but also because we want to shoulder our responsibility for bringing about the just  secure  caring international order in which we believe.   The capacity for human progress cannot be questioned. The thirst for discovery and innovation  the desire to go beyond ourselves  opens the door for meeting human needs every day in all areas. It is a question of placing this immense creative force in the service of those values on which human dignity is based  eliminating arbitrariness  injustice and all forms of discrimination  starting with those that women have so unfairly endured throughout history. We cannot stop; we cannot give up.   In the United Nations  with a rational attitude  with the hope engendered by our common values  we can launch an era of world prosperity and unity. For that  we need coordination  not unilateral action. Development must be sustainable and not uncontrolled. We need permanent political dialogue. We should not give in to old temptations or new cold wars. We have to eradicate extreme poverty and denounce the selfishness of the richest. We need the United Nations. We need all men and women to know that their dignity is dependent on the dignity of their peers.   Above all  hundreds of millions of people in Africa  Latin America and Asia need us: that must be the basic purpose of our endeavours. Spain is committed to those endeavours and will fulfil its historic duty to eradicate extreme poverty around the world. This generation can do it; this generation must do it. "
"54",2252,"EST",63,2008,"Allow me to begin by congratulating Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann upon his assumption of the office of President of the General Assembly. I wish him success in his responsibilities and endeavours. I also wish to express my appreciation and respect to his predecessor  Mr. Srgjan Kerim  for his effective leadership during the sixty-second session of the General Assembly.  I shall be brief. I would like to speak today about the following three issues: the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the prospects for realizing them; natural disasters and humanitarian assistance; and the war between Georgia and Russia  along with some of the conclusions that can be drawn from it.  Let me begin with the Millennium Development Goals. We must bear in mind that over half of the time originally allotted for achieving the Goals is already behind us. Yet  have we actually reached half our goals? As Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon reported here 20 days ago  there are reasons to doubt that we have. Some achievements can be regarded as noteworthy progress  for example greater access to education  a marked reduction in infant mortality  debt relief for developing countries  an increase in access to information and communication technology for people in developing countries  and so on. We have also made certain progress in the fight against HIV/AIDS.  At the same time  however  progress in the spheres of trade and development cooperation has been modest. From the Secretary-General’s report  it is clear that  although the donor States have increased their official development aid  the actual flow of financial assistance in the course of the past two years has actually decreased.  The European Union  of which Estonia is a member  is on the whole  on track towards increasing its development aid to 0.7 per cent of its gross national income  the objective agreed at the United Nations. Estonia has steadily increased its share among international donors; our development aid has grown fourfold since 2004.  In addition to the actual decrease in development aid  we suffered a serious setback when the Doha Development Round of trade negotiations stalled and where the main theme has been a more efficient integration of developing countries into a world trading system based upon equality and regulations.  I would now like to set forth several positions based upon matters of principle that Estonia regards as essential  and which are also part of the United Nations Millennium Declaration.  First  every nation is primarily responsible for its own development. In order to ensure their proper development  developing countries must strengthen their administrative infrastructure and capacity  intensify their fight against corruption and put their economic  environment in order. That is the only way to create conditions suitable for an efficient mode of    08-51839 8  transferring development aid and for increasing the benefits of the aid received.  High levels of corruption  inefficient administrative capacity and an unresponsive economic climate make it difficult for donor-nation public opinion to support increases in development aid. In a word  our electorates — and here I am of course speaking of democratic countries with free and fair elections — do not understand why their taxes are spent that way.  Secondly  donor States and organizations can enhance the effectiveness of development cooperation by mutually coordinating and standardizing the procedures involved in development cooperation.  Finally  I would like to stress that Estonia strongly supports British Prime Minister Gordon Brown’s and Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s initiative  the Millennium Development Goals Call to Action. The objective is to inform the general public of the importance of fulfilling the objectives of the Millennium Development Goals programme. This year  Estonia also joined that initiative. I personally hope that Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon was right when he said that the MDGs are still achievable if we act now.  The second Wednesday of October is the International Day for Natural Disaster Reduction. In that connection  as opposed to the fight against poverty or diseases  we cannot of course set objectives for ourselves that can be expressed in monetary amounts. We can  however  formulate and implement measures that can help to minimize the dangers and threats to people and their property  and to avoid or reduce destruction to physical infrastructure and the environment. We can thereby limit losses and alleviate the suffering of people. That  in turn  can prevent the social and economic convulsions that natural catastrophes have on repeated occasions triggered throughout history.  In the case of humanitarian catastrophes  be they natural or man-made disasters  it is of the utmost importance that help arrive on the scene as quickly as possible and that the access of humanitarian experts be ensured  regardless of their nationality or the State or organization that they represent. Unfortunately  there have recently been a number of occasions when various countries have permitted help from abroad only under very specific conditions. As a result of such policies  it is the weakest and the most vulnerable who suffer the most.  As I said earlier  I would like to talk about recent and ongoing events in the southern Caucasus  specifically the military conflict between Georgia and Russia. There are a series of complex issues involved  but here in the General Assembly I would like to raise one fundamental question: What do those events mean for us  the United Nations?  To begin with  we must realize that the principles governing relations between States have been seriously damaged. It is regrettable in the extreme that the basic principles of the United Nations as enshrined in the Charter  such as the unacceptability of threatening the use of force or actual aggression against a nation’s territorial integrity  were grossly and grotesquely violated. Those principles must be and must remain the bases for the activity of the United Nations and the Security Council. Therefore  we have the right to demand and ensure that the United Nations be capable of convincing one Member to withdraw its military forces from the territory of another sovereign Member State and to terminate its aggression.  The capacity of the United Nations to fulfil the expectations placed upon it cannot be dependent upon whether said Member nation chooses or not to act according to the good practices of international law. In the alternative case  the United Nations loses its reason for existence. We cannot allow international law to be followed selectively and only when convenient  for then it is no longer law.   Russia’s behaviour in the weeks following the cessation of combat activity showed us that  unfortunately  even in the first decade of the twenty-first century  it is possible to refuse to adhere to international treaties  to interpret them arbitrarily and to observe international laws only when it serves one’s interest. A permanent member of the Security Council should be especially committed to fulfilling the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. That forces us once more to conclude that  in the interests of the international community  it is imperative to improve the capacity of the United Nations to regulate and resolve conflicts. Looking at recent events  it has become quite clear how important it is to proceed with the reform of the Security Council.   The previous month’s events in the southern Caucasus raised another issue. Even before the armed   9 08-51839  conflict broke out  Georgia was the target of a cyberwar aimed at Government websites  as well as those of news agencies and banks. In the case of cyberattacks and cyberwarfare  it is becoming ever more difficult to determine and apprehend the perpetrators. As I stated last year from this very rostrum  cyberattacks are an international problem — indeed  a form of aggression — that no nation is able to deal with on its own. Cyberattacks can be launched against any nation on any continent  and from any continent.   Administering and policing the cyberworld to avoid criminal and hostile attacks requires extensive cooperation and the standardization of relevant international regulations. I call upon all United Nations Member nations to deal with the risks associated with cybersecurity with the utmost seriousness. Estonia  which has extensive experience dealing with and repulsing cyberattacks  is ready to contribute its expertise to thwarting that new form of criminal warfare. "
"55",2298,"ETH",63,2008,"I should like to begin by congratulating you  Sir  on your election to the presidency and wishing you every success in the months ahead. I pledge my country’s fullest cooperation and support in the discharge of your duties and responsibilities. I must also extend my sincere appreciation to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his effective leadership in promoting global peace  security and development.  Last year  this Assembly declared and honoured the opening of Ethiopia’s third millennium. We appreciate that honour. It provided a tangible foundation for the renaissance of Ethiopia  most recently symbolized by the re-erection of the Obelisk of Axum  brought back from Italy to the land of its origin  where it was carved 17 centuries ago. We are grateful to the Italian Government for that right and bold decision.  A central element of our millennium celebrations has been the initiation of numerous development activities for the war on poverty and our commitment to attain the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). As the Secretary-General has noted  progress towards the MDGs in Africa has been uneven. It is indeed alarming that no country is likely to reach all the MDGs by 2015. We are at the moment at the midway mark and we all recognize that we are behind schedule. We hope that the high-level event on the MDGs has   5 08-53141  achieved its objective of creating global awareness and renewed commitment  with particular focus on Africa.  I concur with the Secretary-General that we are facing a development emergency. In that regard  decisive and timely action must be taken by developed and developing countries alike to live up to their commitments to the Millennium Development Goals. Food insecurity could undermine core democratic values and ruin national development efforts. Governments should therefore take the lead and work together in the economic sector to resolve the current global food crisis.  The Monterrey Consensus on financing for development  integrating aid  debt relief  market access  good governance and foreign direct investment is a litmus test for the success of global partnerships. We call on the developed countries to honour their commitment to devote 0.7 per cent of their gross national income to overseas development assistance.  The Millennium Development Goals provide the critical minimum for our survival as a nation and the basis for the profound transformation in which we are currently engaged. Ethiopia’s priorities remain the eradication of poverty  sustainable development and ensuring good governance  democracy and respect for human rights. Those are not a choice  but a necessity for our survival as a nation. We have laid the foundations for continued growth and democratization  building democratic institutions from the grass roots and providing the necessary political space for responsible democratization.  Our average of 10 per cent growth over the last five years is continuing despite the setbacks of recent months. We continue protecting poverty-targeted outlays and increasing capital expenditure on infrastructure  education  health and pro-poor sectors. For the first time in its history  Ethiopia is making real and meaningful economic progress. It is the fastest growing non-oil economy in Africa.  Ethiopia is both landlocked and one of the least developed countries. Accordingly  we attach great importance to the full implementation of both the Brussels and the Almaty Programmes of Action. While we appreciate all external assistance  we are equally conscious of the need for predictable  strong and enduring partnerships for mutual benefit. We need economic relations that no longer penalize poor countries and ones that provide greater flexibility in development aid  the transfer of capital and the removal of excessive indebtedness.  The objectives of the Millennium Development Goals make it clear that global affluence and welfare are inseparable and that prosperity cannot coexist with abject poverty. In the context of the present world trading system  we urge realistic preferential terms of trade  especially to least developed countries  including quota- and duty-free market access for all their goods and services.  Ethiopia has consistently helped to promote peace and stability in our region. We have no doubt that sustainable development will be possible only with durable peace and security. Those form the very foundation of our subregional organization  the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD). As the current Chair of IGAD  Ethiopia is determined to ensure that its revitalization will become a reality  enhance regional integration and promote peace  security and development.  We know the dangers of continued conflict in our region. That is indeed why we have committed ourselves to peace in Somalia ever since we helped organize the first broad-based peace conference in 1992. We have consistently supported all efforts to bring about an effective Government in that country. In that regard  we are encouraged by the latest positive political developments in Somalia. The Djibouti Agreement and the Addis Ababa road map open the way for further progress in the peace process. We now look forward to the planned IGAD summit in Nairobi early next month to help Somalia’s leaders do more for national reconciliation.  At the same time  we urge the Security Council to discharge its responsibility by deploying a peacekeeping mission to Somalia as soon as possible or at least by allocating the necessary resources to strengthen the African Union Mission to Somalia (AMISOM). We commend the deployment of troops from Uganda and Burundi to AMISOM. It is never too late for others to follow their example.  Ethiopia appreciates the progress made in the implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement in the Sudan. We urge the parties to do more in overcoming the challenges facing them. However  we must emphasize that the international community should also bear its shared responsibility in that regard. Ethiopia fully supports the African Union    08-53141 6  position on Darfur and the handling of the International Criminal Court-Sudan issue.  Ethiopia stands firmly committed to resolving all outstanding issues with Eritrea through peaceful  political  legal and diplomatic means.  Terrorism is a scourge that impedes peace and development in any part of the world. As its occurrence in any form threatens global security as a whole  Ethiopia believes that it should be addressed collectively. In that regard  we attach great significance to the ability of dialogue among civilizations to build a culture of tolerance that will enable us to create closer understanding among nations — all nations.  Ethiopia remains committed to the United Nations reform process and its revitalization. They are critical to the credibility of the United Nations and the future of multilateralism. As a founding Member of the United Nations  Ethiopia will always remain loyal to its purpose and principles.  The United Nations is the custodian of multilateral diplomacy. At no time since the Second World War have multilateralism and genuine cooperation been as critical as they are today. That is why we need the United Nations as never before. It is a body that remains vital to the future of us all  developing and developed countries alike. "
"56",2344,"FIN",63,2008,"Let me first congratulate you  Sir  on your election to preside over the sixty-third session of the General Assembly. We express our full support for your presidency. I also thank the Secretary-General for his resolute efforts to promote the United Nations and its values.  Finland aligns itself with the statement of the European Union.  Our world is facing unforeseen challenges  such as climate change and the food crisis. The current economic turmoil also requires decisive action. At the same time  we have not been able to rid ourselves of conventional crisis. Unfortunately  armed conflicts are still a reality all over the world. Too often  we — the international community — are unable to agree on a common response. Too often  people affected by poverty and conflicts are let down.  The need to adapt the international architecture to these challenges is deeper than ever. We need an efficient United Nations to find common solutions for our future. The United Nations represents collective security in its most global form. Finland is committed to building a more secure  fair and just world through a reformed and credible United Nations.  I had the pleasure earlier this week of presenting to the Secretary-General the final report of the Helsinki Process on Globalization and Democracy. The main political message of this joint initiative of Finland and the United Republic of Tanzania is that some of the challenges posed by globalization can be solved only through multi-stakeholder dialogue  and that the United Nations could play an important role in facilitating and developing new practices for such cooperation.  Climate change must be addressed with vigour. Otherwise  it can wipe out our achievements in the field of sustainable development and even bring into question the whole future of mankind. Recent extreme weather phenomena can be a serious indication of the challenges we are about to face. Multilateral engagement and shared responsibility are the only effective means to tackle this global menace. Others’ indifference is no excuse for inaction. Climate change is a matter of our responsibility to future generations. There is no place for petty politics or recrimination.  The United Nations has to play a leading role in the global response to climate change. We must reach a    08-51606 2  comprehensive global agreement on a new international climate regime. The Copenhagen Climate Change Conference will take place in December next year. It is evident that global commitments need to be implemented and also supplemented by national and regional action. It is important to include all stakeholders  from non-governmental organizations to private enterprises  and from individual citizens to Governments. We need everybody; it is necessary that women too can participate fully in this work.  Industrialized countries have to bear their share in mitigating climate change. However  international negotiations on the new climate regime cannot succeed without extensive participation by the developing countries. We must actively support the most vulnerable developing countries in adapting to and combating climate change.  There is mounting evidence that poverty  especially in rural areas  can be reduced by sustainable management of natural resources. Forests are crucial in reducing greenhouse gases. Finland has a long history of sustainable forest management  and we understand its impact on rural development and employment. We would like the United Nations to intensify its efforts to assist Governments and communities to improve their capacities for rural development and sustainable forest management. We are of course ready to work with others in this respect.  I am pleased to be a co-host  together with the President of Liberia  Ms. Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf  my friend  of the International Colloquium on Women’s Empowerment  to be held in Liberia next March. The conference will address women’s role in climate change  security  governance and leadership.  Rising food prices are a challenge with worldwide consequences. Once again the poorest and the most vulnerable — women and children — suffer the most. Food shortages lead to deterioration of diets  and can provoke social unrest. Effective Government action and improved donor coordination are crucial in tackling the food crisis. The United Nations Comprehensive Framework for Action is an excellent initiative in addressing this global challenge.  Parallel to the short-term response  attention must be paid to medium- and long-term policies in enhancing food security. Support for the rural sector is crucial for sustainable and equitable development  growth and well-being. Moreover  the promotion of good agricultural practices is among the best approaches to adaptation to climate change.  This food issue can also provide opportunities. If developing countries are supported in the spirit of the Aid for Trade agenda  they can better take advantage of their agricultural potential  including exporting. And we need to ensure  again  that both women and men benefit from support  keeping in mind that women produce most of the food in many developing countries.  The United Nations currently deploys well over 100 000 military and civilian personnel in peacekeeping operations. This is a remarkable figure  and we  the Member States  must continue to support the United Nations efforts in this field. The United Nations and regional organizations should work closer together in carrying the burden in preventing and resolving conflicts.  Increased cooperation should be extended to the African Union. We already have good cooperation and experience in our own region  because improving efficiency and improving cooperation between the European Union and the United Nations remain a top priority. In Kosovo  and most recently also in Georgia  we continue close cooperation between the United Nations  the European Union and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.   That is why I also dare to say that increased cooperation should be extended to the African Union. A continued United Nations peacekeeping presence in Chad and in the Central African Republic would contribute to wider stabilization efforts  both locally and regionally.  Tackling today’s multifold conflicts requires a comprehensive approach to security. Trade  development policy and humanitarian aid need to be utilized alongside traditional crisis management tools. We must — even better than today — take women and children into account in conflicts and post-conflict peacebuilding.  We have made good decisions. We have to make them become reality. I am pleased to inform the Assembly that last Friday Finland published a national action plan on implementing Security Council resolution 1325 (2000). We hope that more and more member countries will do the same.   3 08-51606   Furthermore  there can be no sustainable peace without justice. Finland strongly supports the International Criminal Court in rejecting impunity for the most serious international crimes.  Finally  I want to share my memories and experience. I had the privilege to co-preside over the Millennium Summit with President Sam Nujoma of Namibia eight years ago. We witnessed leaders having the spirit and the courage to adopt the Millennium Declaration and to make a commitment on the Millennium Development Goals. It is our duty to fulfil these commitments. Africa requires our devoted attention and support  as was agreed yesterday. Let us work for it  because today  in this Hall  it is once again time to pledge our joint commitment to the ideas and values of the United Nations.   Everyone present may remember what the Charter calls us to do: “to unite our strength to maintain international peace and security”. While the concept of security has changed and become broader  the onus is on us to follow this call of the Charter and translate it into action."
"57",2388,"FJI",63,2008,"The people of Fiji warmly congratulate Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session. We also convey our sincere gratitude to his predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Srgjan Kerim. I am particularly happy also to acknowledge the presence of the Prime Minister of the Solomon Islands  Mr. Derrick Sikua  one of the Vice-Presidents of the General Assembly and a member of our region of the South Pacific.  This session of the General Assembly is addressing several issues of critical global interest: the global food crisis; climate change; peacekeeping; and the law of the sea. All of those issues are of great and direct importance to small island nations such as Fiji. I will first briefly touch upon some of them.  The people of Fiji have been affected in a very real  immediate  serious and tangible way by the shocks transmitted to our small nation with the dramatic escalation in global food prices  energy price rises and the downturn in the global economy. In Fiji we are using these adverse external developments as an opportunity to revamp our long-neglected agricultural sector. We have ample land resources  and we must put them to better and more productive use.  The food crisis and the need for self-reliance unfortunately run counter to the emergence of world trading rules. The principle of free trade dictates an open economy. Yet small developing economies like ours in Fiji need to protect our agriculture to ensure food security. We very much hope that international trade negotiations and multilateral and bilateral trade deals will enable us to protect agricultural development in our small  vulnerable economies. Fiji will support all concerted efforts  public and private  national and multinational  regional and subregional  that are being pursued to address the global food crisis.   25 08-52265   On the issue of climate change  Fiji looks to  and is relying on  the leadership of the Assembly President. This is a critical issue for the very small island and atoll nations in the Pacific. While the rest of the world continues endlessly to debate the implications of climate change  in the very small islands and atolls in the Pacific the problem is very much upon us. It is now a present and very real danger. It poses a serious risk to regional stability and security.  I appeal to the international community and its system of institutions to enhance efforts to assist us to address the threats of global climate change. We need investments in adaptation measures. We need to move from rhetoric to a more pragmatic and speedy response. We call upon the agencies and our regional partners to coordinate efforts to ensure that we in the Pacific region have the capacity  both human and institutional  to deal with this new threat  especially as it is getting stronger. The observed and potential impacts on our peoples and ecosystems due to climate change are all too real and immediate. We count on the President and the Secretary-General to exercise more vigorous and active leadership on this issue of global climate change.  I will now speak briefly on peacekeeping. I convey our gratitude and appreciation to outgoing Under-Secretary-General Jean-Marie Guéhenno for his dedicated leadership at the Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO). He was fair and generous in implementing the reforms within DPKO and in the development of a United Nations peacekeeping doctrine that will guide future United Nations peace operations and missions. We wish Mr. Guéhenno well and assure his successor  Mr. Alain Le Roy  of our full support and cooperation.  Fiji’s soldiers have a proud track record in United Nations peacekeeping operations — a record of professionalism  discipline  compassion and ability. Fiji’s Military Forces have shown that their training and ethics are an asset to peacekeeping operations. We continue to work very hard to keep that exceptional record intact. Yet despite that  the relationship between Fiji and DPKO has been under strain. That is because of Fiji’s military’s involvement in our Government since December 2006. We are  however  encouraged by the ongoing discussion between officials of our Permanent Mission and the Department of Peacekeeping Operations. It would be less than honest of me if I did not observe that undue external influence appears to have been brought to bear to exclude Fiji from participation in new peacekeeping missions. I express the hope that the opportunity will be extended to us to participate in new peacekeeping missions.  Please allow me to now address this body on Fiji’s current situation and on our efforts to take the country forward. I should first like to look back  albeit briefly. Fiji became independent on 10 October 1970. Our country then was seen as having great promise and potential. Our people  with high hopes  placed their faith on our country’s leaders to build a new nation that would be peaceful  stable  culturally vibrant  tolerant and prosperous. We felt then that by being part of the international family of nations Fiji could demonstrate by example the way the world should be.  For just over 15 years following independence  we achieved some progress. However  following the coups of 1987 and 2000  the rot set in. Since then  Fiji’s overall political  economic and social situation has continued to deteriorate. Our people’s dream of a tolerant  united and prosperous nation was replaced by a different reality — a reality characterized by political instability  economic stagnation  increasing religious and racial intolerance  ethno-nationalism and politics based on ethno-nationalism  a rise in crime  violence and corruption  increased poverty and the emigration of many of our talented  skilled and experienced citizens.   On 5 December 2006  a political transition took place in Fiji following an intervention from the Fiji Military Forces. Interim measures were put in place by the President to ensure good governance  maintain law and order and stabilize the economy. The President of Fiji subsequently appointed an interim Government  which I head. The legality of those actions has been challenged and the matter is now before the courts of Fiji.  To date  my Government  which remains in effective control of governance in Fiji  has done everything within its power to adhere to the current Constitution. We recognize that that is the supreme law of our nation. At the same time  we have also come to recognize that the very foundation on which we have sought to build our nation has been shaky and weak. Therefore  our efforts must now focus on re-laying a more solid foundation to return Fiji to sustainable democratic governance. Our island nation must be rebuilt on the solid rock-like foundations of equal    08-52265 26  rights  social justice  democracy and good governance. We cannot and must not repeat the mistake of trying to rebuild again on the proven proverbial foundation of sand  which is washed away by the evils of self-interest  incompetence  intolerance and greed.   In January of last year  the interim Government embarked on a comprehensive examination of our political  economic  social and governance problems. We did that to identify what contributed to the abysmal record of successive Governments since May 1987  and also to find durable and just solutions. Early in that undertaking  my Government decided to reach out to the people of Fiji to ensure that they became better aware of Fiji’s problems and that they all became part of the solutions going forward. We did that while being mindful of the larger issue of mandate that the events of December 2006 raised. For my part  I took the view that the interim Government must not pretend that it had the capacity or the wisdom to solve our country’s problems entirely on its own.  My country  Fiji  faces deep-rooted and very fundamental problems that are both complex and structural. My Government therefore recommended to the President of Fiji that he set up a broadly representative and independent consultative body to reach out to the people of Fiji and to get them actively involved in charting the way forward for Fiji. In late 2007  the President of Fiji established a 45-member national council for building a better Fiji and officially launched what is now known as the Peoples Charter Initiative. The President invited the leaders of all major political  social  community  business and religious organizations in the country to join the national council and to contribute to formulating a people’s charter for change  peace and progress. Some  in particular those organizations that remain vigorously opposed to the interim Government  chose not to accept the invitation of the President of Fiji. They wilfully persistently rejected the call to engage in constructive dialogue and to work towards a broad consensus on the way forward for Fiji.  Last year  when I addressed the Assembly  I briefly mentioned our preparations to launch the Peoples Charter Initiative. I said then that through this initiative the broad cross section of Fiji’s people would be fully engaged and involved through consultation and participation in developing a comprehensive action agenda  and that that would be Fiji’s own way of addressing its problems. Today  I am pleased to inform the Assembly that very considerable progress has been achieved on the Peoples Charter Initiative.  The overarching objective of the people’s charter is to rebuild Fiji into a non-racial  culturally vibrant  united  well-governed and truly democratic nation — a nation that seeks progress and prosperity. The vision for rebuilding Fiji that underpins that overarching objective is guided by a number of key principles  such as creating a just and fair society; achieving unity and national identity; ensuring merit-based equality of opportunity for all citizens; transparent and accountable Government; uplifting the disadvantaged in all communities; and mainstreaming our indigenous people  the i-Taukei  in a modern and progressive Fiji.  We embarked upon the very bold programme of drafting a people’s charter advisedly and for some very compelling reasons. We can ill afford to carry on with business as usual and in ways that continue to fragment and divide our nation. In that context  the process of drafting the people’s charter has been a unique and unprecedented one — a nation-wide participatory and consultative process of a scale and type never before attempted in Fiji. The whole process is one of empowerment the likes of which the people of Fiji have never experienced before. Too often in national governance — and this applies to so-called democracies — it is the professional politicians who do the thinking for the people. While the cries and voices of the people are often heard  however  they are just as easily ignored by the elected representatives and so-called leaders.  From the outset  after being appointed as head of the interim Government  I have felt that it was my duty to go to the people of Fiji in the most basic and democratic sense  that is  to consult  to actively involve our people  and to put real people’s democracy to work  house to house  in each settlement and village and in towns and cities right across the country. Through the People’s Charter Initiative  that is what we have been doing.  There are some  both in Fiji and outside  who are cynical in that regard. I am able to understand that  and not only because such a process has never ever been tried before. It is indeed a most challenging and difficult process to undertake. Even though the people’s charter process has been undertaken by the national council at arm’s length from the interim Government  there are those who oppose it simply   27 08-52265  because it is an initiative of the interim Government. What they recognize  but choose not to admit  is that the people’s charter process is a real threat to their positions of vested power and privilege.  When I addressed the Assembly last year  I pleaded for the support of the international community to help us in the wake of all the political and economic turbulence that Fiji has experienced since 1987. I pleaded for support to develop a political and governance framework that is truly democratic  accountable  inclusive  equitable and non-racial  and which will seek to unify Fiji’s diverse communities as a nation. I also sought constructive dialogue and engagement with the international community and with all our bilateral and multilateral development partners. I urged the international community to support us in addressing Fiji’s fundamental problems.  I am asking the international community today not to focus only on the removal of a Government. That has already been done exhaustively. We have been subjected to harsh international measures  which we accepted. We have endured those through the suffering of our people. The coups of 1987 and 2000 were executed in the interests of a few and based on ethno-nationalism  racism and greed. The events of 5 December 2006 were not for any such extremist motivation.   In 2000  in quelling the civilian-led coup  as Commander of the Fiji Military Forces  I played a pivotal role in the handing of political power to a civilian Government. Through the People’s Charter Initiative  I am seeking to empower the people of Fiji at large and to find just and sustainable solutions to our deep-rooted and persistent problems. I wish to assure the international community that I am personally deeply committed to breaking the cycle of coups. Equally important  I am committed to breaking the cycle of bad and unjust governance that Fiji has suffered since May 1987.  To remove the coup culture and to commit to democratic and just governance and the rule of law  it is imperative that policies that promote racial supremacy and that further the interests of self-seeking political  religious and traditional elites are removed once and for all. In good faith  I anticipated that the international community would rally behind and extend support for such goals to help move Fiji forward. Regrettably  so far that has not happened.   To the contrary  since December 2006 punitive measures have continued to be taken against Fiji. Travel sanctions continue  which are being imposed in particular by Australia  New Zealand  the United Kingdom and the United States of America. Those are applied to interim Government ministers  senior civil servants  military personnel and statutory board appointees. Those sanctions have had significant adverse effects on our economy  as well as on the functioning of our key State institutions  on which we rely to promote good governance and accountability. Pressure has been exerted on regional and multilateral agencies not to extend to Fiji much-needed financial  development and technical assistance.   As a result  we have not been able to make as much progress as we should have. We cannot travel and engage in discussions at important regional and international meetings abroad. That is despite the fact that Fiji has made every effort to engage in dialogue with our bilateral partners and the international community in a constructive and transparent manner. We have openly embraced and allowed various missions sent by regional and international bodies such as the Pacific Islands Forum  the European Union  the United Nations and the Commonwealth secretariat. We extended to all of them our fullest support and cooperation in terms of engagement  in arranging appointments and in making available to them whatever information they needed. That demonstrates that we are keen to engage constructively in dialogue with whoever is interested in helping move our country forward. Following the recent Pacific Islands Forum meeting in Niue  I wrote last week to the Forum Chair and indicated that the interim Fiji Government is prepared to re-engage with the Forum Joint Working Group and that we are prepared to welcome a visit  before December 2008  by the Forum’s Ministerial Contact Group.   We are not able to schedule an election to return Fiji to parliamentary democracy in the early part of 2009  as earlier anticipated. We realize that that has caused concern to some of our own people in Fiji  to countries of the region and to some of our development partners. The stance taken by the international community with regard to the delay in convening the election  however  has given much ammunition to our opponents within Fiji. They have used it to vilify us despite the progress that we are making towards just and sustainable solutions to our fundamental problems.    08-52265 28  I have already explained to Fiji’s people the need to delay the election. I wish to inform our regional partners and the international community represented here today that the interim Government cannot convene an election by March 2009. That is due to work still in progress to agree on a democratic electoral system that is acceptable to the people of Fiji and that all political stakeholders can agree to through political dialogue.   We believe that the general election must be held as soon as possible. That will be done only after we have achieved broad consensus in Fiji on a non-racial and truly democratic electoral system  and agreed on a constitutional and legal way to introduce the changes. It is necessary to change our current electoral system because it is undemocratic and does not provide for free and fair elections. It contravenes the principle of equal suffrage as set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. To achieve that  the President of Fiji has proposed that a political dialogue forum be convened as a mechanism independent of the national council. It is through that forum that we hope to reach consensus and introduce the reforms through legal and constitutional means. Again  I say with emphasis  the timeframe to achieve all that is not dependent upon me or the interim Government; it is the collective responsibility of all stakeholders.   In May of this year  Fiji sought assistance from the Commonwealth and the United Nations to facilitate  as a priority and with urgency  the President’s proposed political dialogue forum. We had hoped that the forum  which would initially focus on electoral reform  would have been convened by now. Little progress has been made  and we are concerned about the delay. I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate our request to the United Nations and the Commonwealth to help us urgently in that regard.   After taking into account the feedback from our nation-wide consultations  the draft peoples charter will be amended as necessary and appropriate before it is finalized. It will then be adopted as a vision statement that identifies our core problems and the solutions recommended through the nation-wide consultation process. It is incumbent upon me and my Government to build consensus on the peoples charter as the common principles on which we should rebuild our nation. The peoples charter will present a considered way forward for Fiji. We are not obliged to abandon the enormous and important work being achieved through an extensive participatory and consultative process just because some people remain opposed and have decided not to participate. My Government’s task now is to persuade those opponents to come aboard  to join and to contribute. We hope to and must achieve consensus.  At this particular juncture in the history of our nation  leadership is more about how we can seize the present historic opportunity to manage the transition from the interim Government to a truly democratic Government and nation consisting of various ethnic communities but which is one nation with its people in unity in the true spirit in which the United Nations was established.   In conclusion  I reaffirm Fiji’s commitment to the United Nations and to the various United Nations conventions on human rights  the rule of law and democratic governance. We do not seek any special exemptions from our obligations under those conventions. All we seek from the United Nations is its understanding of our particular circumstances and the complex situation of Fiji. We invite the Organization to work with us to assist us to rebuild our country and move it forward. "
"58",2435,"FRA",63,2008,"I bring you fraternal greetings from Europe — Europe that is conscious of its responsibilities and wishes to act; Europe that is true to its values — democracy and freedom; Europe that is loyal to its friends  but also Europe that wishes to speak to the whole world in service of dialogue and of peace.  At a time when the world is deeply troubled  I have come to tell you  on behalf of Europe  that in the midst of so many difficulties the international community has a political and moral responsibility that we must shoulder. Let us not forget that if we are gathered here today  it is because following one of the most terrible tragedies that humankind has ever known  there were men and women of good will who were determined that in the future no one could ever say  when faced with misfortune: “There is nothing we can   13 08-51570  do.” That is why we are here  because those who went before us did not renounce their responsibility. Europe believes that today  our duty is to act and to refuse to submit.   We can wait no longer. We are beginning to gauge the tragic consequences of having already waited too long. We cannot wait to achieve peace  to end the tragedy in Darfur. We cannot wait to fight terrorism  to avert the food crisis that condemns so many human beings to die of hunger. We cannot wait to prepare for the post-petroleum world  to fight global warming  to save the oceans  to put an end to monetary  social and ecological dumping. We cannot wait to bring ethics to financial capitalism.   For too long we have all been resigned to being powerless. For too long we have retreated before the need to give to the globalized world institutions that will enable it to be regulated.  The world of the twenty-first century cannot be governed with the institutions of the twentieth century. We are a century behind. Let today’s major Powers and the Powers of tomorrow unite to shoulder together the responsibilities their influence gives them in world affairs.   To all those who are hesitant  I wish to say that enlarging the Security Council and the G-8 is not just a matter of fairness  it is also a question of effectiveness. We can no longer wait to turn the G-8 into the G14 and to bring in China  India  South Africa  Mexico and Brazil. Italy is proposing a major step in that direction at the next summit  which it will host  and Italy is right.  Let us act to make our international institutions more representative  because if they are more representative they will be stronger  more effective and more respected. A new world is emerging not only through all our successes  but also through all the crises besetting the planet. However  we cannot receive that new world passively  we must build it.  Let us learn to manage together the most acute crises that no one  not even the most powerful among us  can resolve alone. I am convinced that it is the duty of the heads of State and Government of the countries most directly concerned to meet before the end of the year to examine together the lessons of the most serious financial crisis the world has experienced since that of the 1930s. Who would understand it if the world’s major economies should fail to take the time to meet to discuss what we must do together and the lessons we must draw from what has happened?  Let us rebuild together a regulated capitalism  in which entire swathes of financial activity are not left to the sole judgement of market operators; in which banks do their job; which is to finance economic development rather than to fuel speculation; in which rules of prudence apply to all and serve to avert and soften shocks instead of exacerbating them; in which the credit agencies are controlled and punished when necessary; in which transparency of transactions replaces such opacity that today it is difficult to understand what is happening; and in which modes of remuneration do not drive people to take unreasonable risks. It is my duty to say that those who jeopardize people’s savings should be punished and at last face up to their responsibilities. We will succeed in that on the condition that we work together.  In our globalized world  the fate of each is linked to that of all others. The negotiations on climate change  begun in Bali  will conclude in Copenhagen next year. Whatever our particular interests  we do not have the right to fail.  Europe will adopt an unprecedented raft of measures on energy and climate in December. Europe does not wish to teach lessons; it wishes to set an example. Europe also wishes to set the example by acting to bring about peace. It did so in Georgia. It did so with the Union for the Mediterranean. Because for over half a century Europe has undertaken to stop the endless cycle of war  vengeance and hate that has periodically taken it to the edge of the precipice  it does not want war. It does not want a war of civilizations. It does not want a war of religion. It does not want a cold war.   Europe wants peace  and because it wants peace it says to Russia that it wants links of solidarity with that country  that it wants to build a shared future  and that it wants to be Russia’s partner. Why not build a continent-wide common economic space that would unite Russia and Europe? However  Europe also says to Russia with the same sincerity that it cannot compromise on the principle of the sovereignty and independence of States  their territorial integrity or respect for international law. Europe’s message to all States is that it cannot accept the use of force to settle a dispute.    08-51570 14   Europe says to Iran that it respects that country  that Iran has the right to civil nuclear energy and that it will explore all avenues of dialogue. However  it says to Iran with the same sincerity that it cannot accept a nuclear-armed Iran that would endanger the peace and stability of the whole region. Nor can Europe tolerate — and I say this solemnly — Iran calling for the destruction of the State of Israel.  Europe says to Israel that it is its friend and that it will let no one threaten its existence. Europe says to Israel that it will always be at its side in the fight against terrorism  but with the same sincerity says to telling Israel that there will be no peace until there is a viable Palestinian State with recognized borders.  Europe says to Afghanistan that it will continue to stand by it and that it will not permit barbarians allied with Al-Qaida again to take an entire people hostage and to turn an entire country into a terrorist base.   Europe says to Somalia that it will help it  with the support of the United Nations  to combat the scourge of piracy off its coasts. Until all States join together to establish a maritime police force  we cannot allow some hundreds of pirates to threaten the free passage of ships throughout the world.  Europe says to Africa that it is committed to co-development  that it wishes to be Africa’s privileged partner  and that it has a common destiny with Africa and a profound sense of solidarity. Europe says to Africa that it has its place among the permanent members of the Security Council and in the enlarged G-8. How can one ever hope to settle the great issues of the world while ignoring Africa  South America or a large part of Asia? Europe believes in the African renaissance  which is under way and  first and foremost  is in the hands of the Africans  particularly those of African youth  which is the youth of the world.  Essentially  what brings us here together in this forum  where everyone must listen to the others and thereby show them a form of respect  is something more basic even than democracy. What brings us together is respect for the dignity of all just as they are  and for diversity of their opinions  cultures and beliefs. Human dignity is a universal value. What we must promote everywhere is respect for that diversity  which is the surest guarantor of peace and human fraternity and the surest antidote to intolerance  hatred  violence  obscurantism and fanaticism.  That is what Europe wants: peoples united in respect  understanding and solidarity; peoples united throughout the world working together for the great common cause of safeguarding of humanity. Time is at a premium; the world cannot wait. "
"59",2460,"FSM",63,2008,"I am honoured by this opportunity to address the General Assembly at its sixty-third session. This great institution plays a vital role in the development process of its members and remains the global organization best situated to address the world’s pressing needs and to help find solutions for them. So  it is with pleasure that I use this occasion to make the following remarks on a few challenging issues of vital significance confronting Micronesia today.  I must first congratulate His Excellency Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann on his election to the presidency of the Assembly. He has my delegation’s admiration and full support. In the same vein  I commend the dedication and stewardship of Mr. Srgjan Kerim  President of the Assembly at its sixty-second session.  I wish to offer my greetings to our able Secretary-General and to express the best wishes of my Government as he continues to lead the Organization through the difficult challenges ahead.  The General Assembly is meeting at a time of unusual uncertainties surrounding the global economy. The world financial situation and the double threat posed by the fuel and food crises impose additional strain on all of us and negatively impact our efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and our pursuit of sustainable development. The security of our island countries remains under threat by the effects of climate change.  The fuel crisis is a major challenge to the Members of this Organization. There are few countries in this world that are left unscathed by the worldwide fuel crises. Too often  I am afraid  those most affected by the crisis are those Members of the United Nations that can least afford an effective response. More often than not  they are the small island developing States that are also the most vulnerable Members of this Organization.  The developed countries may have room to respond to the worsening energy crisis without jeopardizing other development programmes. But for us in Micronesia  we are painfully aware of the strong    08-51851 2  and adverse impacts on everything from government operations to the effect on individual households and families.  In a very real sense  the lingering global energy crisis has transformed the energy debate and highlighted the world’s dependence on fossil fuel. Power outages in our state centres have become a regular phenomenon affecting our medical facilities  schools  businesses and everyday government operations  including services to our remote outer islands  which are reachable only by ships. These setbacks are the result of our inability to procure fuel at a reasonable cost. While we recognize that fossil fuel will  in the medium term  remain a necessity  the current energy crisis strengthens Micronesia’s resolve to call for the acceleration of the development of technologies for renewable and affordable sources of energy. Micronesia recognizes that special assistance from the international community and financial institutions in the area of renewable energy is necessary to achieve this goal. We are grateful to our friends that have over time generously extended assistance to that end.  The General Assembly  by its own resolutions  recognizes everyone’s right to food. On a global scale  that right is being threatened as the world faces a severe food crisis. Already  the cost of imported foodstuffs has increased considerably  and my Government and people are thus faced with yet another development challenge — one that has already been exacerbated by the energy crisis. The cost of rice  one of the main imported foodstuffs  which has become a main staple in my people’s diet  is no longer affordable. My Government  in responding to the food crisis  has encouraged the people to increase the local production of our own crops. But that cannot be achieved without the support and cooperation of our development partners and the United Nations system.  The nexus between food security and climate change cannot be overlooked. In Micronesia  farmlands and inhabitants occupy the low-lying fringes and islands barely a few metres above sea level. Taro patches  which provided the main staple of our people for centuries  are now under threat by sea level rise. Already  many islands have experienced inundation of their taro patches and fields of other food crops by salt water  resulting in decreased crop production.  Of equal importance to our self-sufficiency and in meeting some of our nutritional needs is the bounty of our ocean. The ocean is of fundamental importance to Micronesia  as we rely heavily on it. The ocean sustains us  and its resources enrich us. At a time when the world food market is deeply affected by the food crisis  Micronesians are increasingly dependent on the bounty of the sea to provide for their food and for their economic development. It is therefore of paramount importance that we continue to conserve and manage sustainably the use of our marine and fisheries resources. But collateral catches and discards in commercial fisheries remain a concern to us. For Micronesians  these are critical resources that are of cultural importance  and our people depend upon them for their subsistence living. The international community must help us find ways to minimize and eliminate this wasteful use of resources.  Equally damaging to fish stocks is the incidence of illegal  unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing. This practice continues to deprive our people of their food resources  while the illegal operators continue to reap and enjoy the rewards from this activity without any accountability. The major consumer and market outlets must reduce this illegal activity if we are to effectively eliminate this abhorrent and unsustainable practice.  The world’s financial turbulence  as evidenced by the current delicate situation in the host country  is another matter of concern. While the situation emanates from the bigger economies  all of us are at risk  as we are all part of the globalized economy. We encourage the developed countries not to use this as a convenient excuse to reverse their gains in reaching the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of their gross domestic product for official development assistance.  My delegation is encouraged by the spirit and determination of the Members of the United Nations to bring Security Council reform a step closer to reality. Our task remains difficult  but we are encouraged by the recent decision of the General Assembly and look forward to the beginning of the process of intergovernmental negotiations. Among other things  we reiterate our support for the expansion of both membership categories and reaffirm our long-standing view that Japan and India  from the Asian Group  should become permanent members of a reformed Security Council. We also renew our support for Germany  from Western Europe.   3 08-51851   In the attainment of the international development goals  there is no single issue that presents such an enormous challenge to small island developing States  such as the Federated States of Micronesia  than that of climate change. Micronesia is especially concerned about climate change and the grave threat of sea-level rise  which can literally wash away our islands and culture. Three recent articles have been published in the prestigious science journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences  addressing the tipping points for abrupt climate change  including sea-level rise.  A tipping point is a point of no return beyond which an element of the climate system abruptly tips into a new state  with a profound impact on the planet. Examples include tipping points for the melting of glaciers and snow pack from the Tibetan Plateau — the headwaters of most of the rivers in Asia — and the disintegration of the Greenland and West Antarctica ice sheets  which will cause metres of sea-level rise.  The news is startling. Simply put  it means that the planet is in peril — and the islands and low-lying States are  of course  in peril. But we cannot afford to be paralysed. We must undertake an aggressive programme of fast-track mitigation strategies  starting with those that are already justified by their strong co-benefits. This includes the strategy Micronesia promoted last year and again this year to strengthen the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. Our strategy can play a strong role in protecting the climate system as well as the stratospheric ozone layer.  Let me make one final suggestion. Tipping points for abrupt climate change have been called the shadow that haunts climate negotiations. This issue is a shadow because it has never been squarely addressed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).  The global debate on climate change is predominantly framed from a sustainable development perspective. We could not agree more with that focus. But Micronesia is convinced that  while sustainable development is of paramount importance  we must also be assured of our security and our territorial integrity. We must approach climate change from a holistic perspective rather than limiting it to the dimensions of sustainable development  to humanitarian or technical issues  or to economic or environmental issues. Climate change also has an impact on our human rights. It has an impact on international peace and on our own security and territorial integrity  and on our very existence as inhabitants of very small and vulnerable island nations.  Experts have warned that climate change is also a threat to international peace and security. Yet  instead of addressing the issue squarely  the United Nations seems to be more concerned about turf and encroachment  as if it were wrong to admit that territorial integrity  national stability and security might be threatened by the impact of climate change  and that human conflicts might also arise as a direct or indirect result of climate change. Just as the IPCC reports  the Stern Review report and the 2007 Human Development Report inform the negotiations in the context of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  a report analysing the potential impact of climate change on international peace and security should provide additional reasons for urgent and adequate climate change mitigation actions.  Our future — our environment — is at stake. Our culture and our human rights are at stake. But we must not lose hope  because the entire world is represented here. The time to act is now  not later. "
"60",2503,"GAB",63,2008,"At the outset  on behalf of His Excellency El Hadj Omar Bongo Ondimba  President of the Gabonese Republic and head of State  whom I have the honour to represent here  I should like to sincerely congratulate you  Sir  on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session. You can be assured of our full and entire readiness to cooperate to ensure the success of your weighty mission. It is also my pleasure to pay a well-deserved tribute to your predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Srgjan Kerim  for the talent and dedication that he showed in guiding our work throughout the sixty-second session. Finally  to His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon  Secretary-General of the United Nations  I express my encouragement as he carries out his lofty duties at the head of our Organization.  The food crisis that is currently raging is characterized by rising prices for foodstuffs. Its causes are both structural and immediate. Indeed  the predominance of biofuel crops over subsistence crops and the implementation of trade policies based on subsidies and export restrictions have a disastrous   35 08-51570  impact on food security. The food riots of the second half of 2008  which have taken place throughout the world — particularly in Africa — in response to soaring food prices  reflect a major crisis and express the increased difficulties faced by hundreds of millions of people in feeding themselves.   One hardly need repeat the words said by  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali when  in November 1999  he addressed the thirtieth session of the Conference of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO): “Hunger is as unacceptable as war.” It is therefore urgent that we make a lasting response to the food crisis by taking collective action at the global level to halt it and ensure food security for our most vulnerable populations.   Here  I should like to commend the adoption  on 5 June 2008  of the Declaration of the High-level Conference on World Food Security by heads of State or Government meeting in Rome. Likewise  at the regional level  we welcome the conclusions of the regional meeting on the food crisis held on 29 July 2008 in Kinshasa under the auspices of the Economic Community of Central African States. At the continental level  we call for the effective implementation of the July 2003 Maputo Declaration  which sets out a framework for accelerating agricultural development and food security; the 2006 Abuja Declaration  which advocates a green revolution in Africa; and  more recently  the Sharm el-Sheikh Declaration on the challenges of the increase in food prices and agricultural development.   It is in that contact that Gabon  like other countries of the South hit by this crisis  has taken urgent fiscal and budgetary measures supported by a six-month suspension of import duties and taxes on consumer products and a suspension of the value-added tax on such products  causing a substantial loss in terms of the State budget.   In addition  from a medium- and long-term perspective  Gabon is working together with international partners  in particular FAO and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)  to implement its national poverty reduction strategy and its special food security programme. The latter incorporates aspects related to water management  intensifying vegetable production and diversifying and increasing agricultural production. We are prepared to go even further  because we must banish the spectre of hunger and malnutrition once and for all. The achievement of Millennium Development Goal 1 depends on that.   Furthermore  the food crisis poses the problem of the role and place of agriculture in our economies. Rather than making us overly concerned  it should lead us to rethink that sector in order to increase its contribution to the development of our countries.  The challenge of feeding a planet with a growing population is closely linked to the environmental issue and to climate change. Environmental degradation is characterized by the degradation of natural resources  including the growing water shortage  the increase in arid lands  deforestation and the effects of global warming. All these elements prevent an increase in agricultural production that could contribute to a lasting solution to the food crisis. Thus  we must do our utmost to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions.   That is why my country welcomes the road map adopted during the negotiations held in Bali  as the outcome of the thirteenth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The road map is an important step towards the formulation of a follow-up to the Kyoto Protocol  which is set to expire in 2012. Here I should like to commend the recent efforts made by the industrialized countries at the Group of Eight (G-8) summit held in Hokkaido  Japan  in July 2008  at which they once again reaffirmed their will to halve their greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.  For its part  my country  Gabon  whose forests are one of the components of the important Congo  Basin — the planet’s second ecological lung  after the Amazon — has acceded without reservation to the conventions related to the fight against climate change and the preservation of biodiversity. Indeed  we have decided to shoulder our share of the responsibility by devoting 11 per cent of our territory to humankind through  inter alia  the establishment of 13 national parks. Naturally  those efforts require others  in particular the admission of our forests into the carbon-trading mechanisms and the granting of compensatory measures to African countries by industrialized countries  which are the primary emitters of carbon dioxide.   Developing countries need the international community’s ongoing and substantial support to meet the new challenges that they face. It is thus urgent that    08-51570 36  all development partners keep their promises  in particular by doubling official development assistance  introducing innovative development financing methods and cancelling debt  whose burden undermines our development efforts.  This appeal also has to do with the varying constraints that weigh on developing countries  particularly HIV/AIDS pandemic  malaria and other infectious diseases that impact their populations and their economies. In fact  with regard to HIV/AIDS  the efforts of African countries to provide universal access to prevention  care and treatment by 2010 do not appear to be sufficient to eradicate that modern-day scourge.  The interdependence of the threats confronting the international community highlights more than ever the need to provide a new impetus to the efforts to promote solidarity and international peace and security. In a number of regions around the world  tensions and deep crises maintain instability and insecurity  thereby inhibiting any chance for development.   Specifically with regard to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict  we can never emphasize enough that only concerted and thorough efforts based on the principle of two States — Israel and Palestine — living in peace and security within secure and internationally recognized borders will make it possible to bring about a lasting  just and equitable solution to that conflict.  In Africa as well there are many hotspots of tension that continue to be concern. That is the case with respect to Somalia  where the instability that has prevailed for more than 15 years undermines any fledgling development. Still  we should commend the recent efforts to promote a political process that would be open to all in that country  in particular reaching the agreement signed on 9 June 2008 in Djibouti between the Federal Transition Government and the Alliance for the Reliberation of Somalia under the auspices of the United Nations  with the support of the African Union. One hopes that that event  which is a true opportunity towards a lasting settlement of that conflict  will lead to the deployment of a United Nations peacekeeping operation that could help end the chaos that has prevailed in that country since 1990.  The overall security situation in Darfur also continues to be a source of great concern for the international community. One should  however  commend and encourage the tenacious efforts undertaken in the joint mediation of the African Union and the United Nations in carrying out an inclusive process that would lead to a settlement to the conflict in Darfur  which has lasted for a number of years.  The situation between Chad and the Sudan has sparked genuine hope  due to the resumption of dialogue between those two States within the framework of the various agreements that they have signed  particularly the Dakar Agreement of 13 March 2008.  With respect to Central African Republic  we can only commend the meaningful progress made within the framework of the preparations for an inclusive political dialogue since the first meeting of the follow-up committee on peace talks. We encourage the United Nations and international partners to commit further in rebuilding that fraternal country.  Lastly  with respect to Côte d’Ivoire  Gabon welcomes the progress made in the implementation of the Ouagadougou Agreement and its additional agreements. We appeal to the various partners of that fraternal country to support those efforts.  The myriad challenges we have just addressed can be dealt with only through collective actions at the global level. That is why the heads of State and Government recognized in the Millennium Declaration and reaffirmed in the Outcome Document of the 2005 World Summit the need to strengthen the United Nations in order to make it a tool that would allow them to better achieve their priority goals. That is why my country welcomes the fact that since the 2005 World Summit  most of the major recommendations in the Outcome Document have been implemented in the framework of the process of reform of the United Nations. The establishment of two major bodies — the Peacebuilding Commission and the Human Rights Council  which have been operational since June 2006 — is a perfect demonstration of this.   Bolstered by the major progress made  we need to continue our efforts over the coming sessions to complete the reform process. For example  we need to complete the revitalization of the General Assembly  the Organization’s most representative deliberative body. Similarly  consistency in the actions of the United Nations bodies should be reinforced. From that standpoint  I wish to commend the Delivering as One initiative  which has had encouraging results in the pilot countries.   37 08-51570   Regarding reform in the Security Council  we need to commend the tireless efforts of the different Presidents of the General Assembly  which have made it possible to complete the process of consultations that should lead to the beginning of intergovernmental negotiations by 31 January 2009  at the latest. The building of a more just and secure world that would meet the deep aspirations of our peoples depends on that. "
"61",2550,"GBR",63,2008,"It is humbling to stand before this great Assembly today. Events of recent weeks have proved beyond doubt that we are now in a new global age. Living through the first financial crisis and the first resources crisis of globalization  we are a world not simply in transition  but facing transformation  with change more far-reaching than anything we have seen in our lifetimes. The challenges  the opportunities for us and the risks that we now face come together at the global crossroads of the United Nations  providing the focus for debate and decision here in this General Assembly Hall.   A predecessor of mine said that if one built the present only in the image of the past  one would miss out entirely on the challenges of the future. It is to those challenges of the future that I want to address my remarks today.  In the next two decades  our world economy will double in size. That means double the opportunities and potential for more businesses  more jobs and more prosperity. Extraordinary promise and opportunity await  but there are also wholly new insecurities and pressures — global problems that will require global solutions.  The twin shocks of a global credit crunch and soaring commodity prices lead straight to the front doors of every family in every country  with higher oil  gas and food prices  and higher costs for credit. But because it is a global financial crisis and a global shortage of food and resources  it will not be resolved simply by individual nations acting in isolation  although there is much that they can do themselves. It will be solved in the end by us acting together.  I want to talk about how we can work together to tackle financial instability and the intense pressure now on our finite world resources. The immediate priority is to help people everywhere cope with these difficult times and to do so fairly. That is why  in Britain  we have acted to help those hit hardest  assisting people with the costs of gas and electricity  supporting homeowners and the housing market and helping people acquire the skills to do the new jobs of the twenty-first century.  But if we have learned anything in the past few years about the world in which we are now living  it is that the world we share is more interconnected than ever before and that the solutions have to be similarly coordinated.  First  we must do all that it takes to stabilize the still turbulent financial markets and  in the months ahead  we must work together to rebuild the world financial system around clear principles. In the short term  each country is taking action to deal with the fallout of the credit crunch  and the United States of America deserves support from the rest of the world as it seeks to agree on in detail what all parties agree on in principle.  In Britain  we have taken decisive action to promote stability in our banking system  protecting depositors and introducing a temporary ban on short-selling. We have already injected billions into the market  making in excess of £100 billion available  and announced only last week that our special liquidity scheme will be extended until the end of January next year.  Confidence in the future is also needed to build confidence today  and that confidence will be built by showing that what are global problems can be addressed by globally coordinated solutions. I believe there are five key principles behind that all nations should unite around as we examine the future of our financial system.  The first principle is that of transparency. People must know what they are buying and selling  and they must know what they are dealing with and not fear what might be hidden on each other’s books. We must look at the rapid introduction of improved internationally acceptable accounting standards and disclosure.  Secondly  there must be sound banking practice and more effective regulation that looks not just at solvency but at liquidity  at managing and pricing risks for bad times and for good times  together.  Thirdly  there must be responsibility. No member of senior management should be able to say he or she did not understand the risks they were running and walk away from his or her obligations.  Fourthly  there must be integrity. Most people agree that companies should align reward with stability and long-term gain because what matters is hard work    19 08-52272  effort and enterprise. We should align the advice of credit-rating agencies with the interests of the investors.  Fifthly  just as banks are global and the flows of capital are global  so oversight can no longer just be national but must also include global supervision. That is why we want to work to support immediately the establishment of international colleges for each of the largest global financial institutions — 30 of them by the end of the year.   The international institutions built in the wake of the Second World War have not kept pace with the changing global economy. We need national regulators to be cooperative  rules and principles to be consistent  and international movements of capital to be transparent.  The current era has been one of global prosperity. It has also been an era of global turbulence  and while there has been irresponsibility  we must now say clearly that the age of irresponsibility must be ended. We must now build that new global financial order  founding it on transparency  not opacity; rewarding success  not excess; and responsibility  not impunity. That order must be global  not national.  Global action cannot be limited to financial stability. We must also address another problem of globalization — the global scramble for resources. We need global action to deal with high commodity prices and a rising global population demanding more energy. Only by taking tough decisions on energy security and climate change and by bringing together a new global partnership of oil producers and oil consumers can we bring stability to global energy markets and secure sustainable energy supplies for the long term.  We are committed to tackling the global challenge of climate change. Oil will of course continue to meet a large part of our global energy needs for some decades to come  but over the past year we have seen the price of oil rise to as high as $146 per barrel before falling again to $90 in the past month — a fall of nearly 40 per cent. Such high and volatile prices have a harmful impact on the global economy  and all countries surely have a shared interest in avoiding such dramatic swings in the price of scarce resources.  We must now therefore consider whether the current international architecture can bring the more transparent and stable energy markets this global economy clearly needs. We must bring producers and consumers together  build common understanding and address the issues through meaningful and sustained dialogue. At the end of this year  I will be hosting a global energy summit in London  building on the momentum generated in Jeddah  Saudi Arabia  to agree on key areas for further action. It is only by acting together that we can make the most of the world’s scarce resources and harness the power of our greater interdependence for our common good.  Some say that in a time of difficulty we should look inwards and cut aid; that we have an excuse for walking by on the other side; and that  by our inaction  we tolerate famine — but in today’s world  there is no other side.  Africa is not part of the problem  but an indisputable part of the solution. It is only by helping Africa to become a net exporter of food rather than a net importer that we can hope to achieve a long-term end to soaring food prices. Only by restarting and seeing the trade talks through can we help our economies benefit from the annual boost of $150 billion that would be achieved by removing the protectionist trade barriers and trade-distorting subsidies that currently cost developing countries the most — $15 billion a year in their agricultural incomes alone.  As Governments and as nations  we must respond with courage and vision to the new insecurities that face people  because while the global changes happening all around us are complex  the instincts they summon up in people are not. We must resist those instincts that are protectionist. Now is not the time to pull up the drawbridge  to seek solace in isolation or to revert to an outdated and futile protectionism. It is only by maintaining our open  flexible and dynamic economies that we can best secure people’s jobs  homes and standards of living in a global age.   Our global institutions have always had a sweeping ambition  set up not against a single enemy but against poverty  conflict  injustice and intolerance  and set up in the belief that  for peace to last  prosperity must be shared. Now we must build on the idealism of the era that created those institutions and change and evolve those institutions to meet the challenges of the global age. This United Nations is where the world turns to confront some of its greatest    08-52272 20  challenges. It is where international law is made  where the most acute political problems are addressed  and where the hopes of the world for a better future ultimately rest.  For the past 40 years  it has been this United Nations that has been the key forum where the international community has sought peace in the Middle East  and it is the United Nations that must help the next Government of Israel build on the foundations laid by Prime Minister Olmert and President Abbas to agree to a two-State solution that guarantees the security of Israel and gives the Palestinians a viable State.  In Cyprus  where the United Nations has been present for 30 years and more  we have a real chance of a settlement  thanks to new leadership  which has our support.  In Afghanistan  the International Security Assistance Force is training Afghans to take back their country after two generations of almost constant conflict. When the Afghan Government can deny its land to Al-Qaida and its associates  the international community will have done its job  but the task is hard and long. Progress is encouraging  but must be continued and stepped up.  In the Sudan  United Nations peacekeepers help keep the fragile North-South peace agreement in place  but Darfur remains for all of us a disaster. It is the responsibility of the Government of the Sudan to create the conditions in Darfur that will allow the conflict to end and a new deal for the people of Darfur to be put in place. Justice has to be part of any sustainable peace.  Difficulty has never daunted the United Nations. Where we are rebuffed  we are resolute  so we must also send a powerful signal of our support for democracy and human rights in Zimbabwe. We must stand firm against oppression in Burma. We must  as we did yesterday  reaffirm the practical measures that underpin our determination to defeat poverty. Now would be the worst time to turn our back on the Millennium Development Goals.  We have reached a unique point in the world’s history. For the first time in human history  we have the opportunity to come together around a global covenant  to reframe the international architecture to make it fit for the challenges facing us in the twenty-first century  and to build the first truly global society and global citizenship. Our history is not our destiny  it is what we choose to make it.  Let us resolve today to end any irresponsibility  to protect the global public interest by cleaning up the world’s financial system and to reaffirm our commitment to meeting our global responsibilities on trade  poverty  energy and climate change  and let us act upon that as people  as Governments  as nations united. Let history record that ours was a truly global response to the first truly global crisis."
"62",2574,"GEO",63,2008,"I welcome the opportunity today to address this sixty-third annual gathering of the Assembly at such a critical moment in the history of my own country and of the United Nations.  Sometimes  the most extreme tests of this institution’s towering ideals arise in small  faraway places  of which we know very little. I come to you as the representative of one of those places — the country of Georgia  a land of fewer than 5 million that last month was invaded by our neighbour. Despite our small size  the legal  moral  political and security implications raised by that invasion could not have greater consequences.  Indeed  those issues cut through to the heart of the founding Charter of the United Nations. The principles enshrined in that Charter include the inviolability of sovereign borders  the sanctity of human rights  the supremacy of international law and the global rejection of armed aggression.  All of those principles were put to the test by the invasion and now hang in the balance. The invasion violated Georgia’s internationally recognized borders. At the very beginning of the aggression  we clearly told our own people and the world that the spirit of the people of Georgia would not be broken and that we would never give up freedom and never surrender. We never did and never will. The subsequent recognition of the so-called independence of our two regions — South Ossetia  with a population of less than 20 000 in the areas that Russia controlled  and Abkhazia  with a population of less than 50 000 ethnic Abkhaz — in order to punish our country and send a signal to the rest of the world  not only challenged our territorial integrity but also defied common sense and the elementary principles of international interaction. The ethnic cleansing of hundreds of thousands of our people violated the very idea of human rights.   This General Assembly  therefore  faces a general challenge. We are called upon not just to respond to the particular question of one instance of armed aggression in a single place but to define our attitude towards armed aggression in all places. We are called upon to answer the momentous question: will this body stand up for its founding principles  or will it allow them to be crushed under the treads of invading tanks  under the boots of ethnic cleansers  under the immobilizing impact of cyberattacks and under the pernicious tactics of violent separatism?  What would it mean for every member of this Assembly to defend the underlying principles of the United Nations?  First  each of us must refuse to stand silent in the face of this armed aggression and assault on human rights.  Secondly  we must stand united and immediately adopt a policy of non-recognition towards Georgia’s two breakaway provinces  currently occupied and    08-51606 26  annexed by the aggressor. Together  we have both a moral and a legal obligation to protect international law and the world order.  Thirdly  we must ensure that all parties comply with the full terms of the existing ceasefire agreement.   Fourthly  and lastly  we must resolve to create a meaningful United Nations conflict resolution process that will peacefully reunify Georgia and solve the problem.  The bottom line is this: we must be ready to use the full power of international law and of our collective international institutions to uphold the historic balance of justice and thereby set in motion a series of actions to right these historic wrongs.  While the crisis poses grave challenges for the entire international community  it creates specific obligations for my own country. I would argue that the answer to that new assault on our shared values is not a closing up or a circling of the wagons  but rather greater openness on many fronts. As a democracy  we have nothing to fear. As a democracy  we have an obligation to our people and to the international community to be even more open and transparent. For me and my Government  that commitment translates into a series of specific actions at both the international and the domestic levels. Allow me to explain.  First  I know that there are many people in the world who seek a clearer understanding of how this war started and who started it. Rather than recite our case  let me repeat the simple invitation that I first made on 17 August while standing next to German Chancellor Angela Merkel  who visited Georgia immediately after the unleashing of hostilities  when I proposed that there should be an exhaustive independent investigation of the origins and causes of this war.  Investigators must have unimpeded access to all officials  documents and intelligence. Georgia welcomes such an investigation. My Government is ready to share every piece of evidence and to provide access to every witness sought by investigators. We call on the other party to this conflict to fully cooperate and not to obstruct the investigation. That is how democracies behave. The truth must come out  not only to clarify how events unfolded last month but also to help us to answer the fundamental questions that this invasion has raised.  My Government’s second initiative of openness involves developments within our borders. Whereas others waged this war with arms  we will wage it with values. Georgia was attacked because it is a successful democracy in our part of the world. Our response today is to make our democracy even more robust. That is why I am announcing to the Assembly four categories of expanded democratic initiatives.  First  we will strengthen the checks and balances of our democratic institutions  including granting greater independence to parliament and to the judiciary. Secondly  we will provide additional resources and protections to foster greater political pluralism  including by increasing funding for opposition parties and ensuring they have greater access to the airwaves. Thirdly  we will strengthen the rule of law by introducing enhanced due process  trials by jury and lifetime judicial appointments. Fourthly  we will expand and deepen protections for private property. In everything we do  we will be transparent.  This morning  I was honoured to learn that  in Transparency International’s latest index  Georgia was among the few countries to have risen significantly in the rankings over the past year. Indeed  the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development ranks Georgia among the least corrupt economies in Europe.   Despite all the turmoil  my country has endured. That proves the resiliency and irreversibility of our democratic commitment. In short  we will fight the spectre of aggression and authoritarianism with the most potent weapon in our arsenal  namely  our commitment to ever-expanding freedoms within our own borders. That amounts to nothing less than a second Rose Revolution. If our first revolution was about meeting a threat from within by reinventing a failed State riddled by corruption  our second revolution must be even more focused  as we now face an even greater challenge — one that comes from the outside. The success of the first Rose Revolution helped save my country. The health of the international order could well depend on the outcome of the second Rose Revolution.  Countless people throughout the world were deeply moved and profoundly troubled by the invasion of Georgia  which began  with tragic irony  on the eve of that great celebration of peace  the Olympic Games. On the most basic level  the world responded with passionate humanity to the plight of ordinary   27 08-51606  Georgians under siege; to the sight of 80-year-old men and women driven from their villages; to the hundreds of thousands of innocent souls taking shelter from bombings; to a small country of less than 5 million people being trampled by a neighbour 300 times its size. The world responded immediately by sending generous aid  by coming to Georgia and by showing its solidarity. Meanwhile  leaders from around the world have been working tirelessly to negotiate and enforce a ceasefire.   I am especially grateful to President Sarkozy of France for his dedication to ensuring that the ceasefire is fully implemented in letter and in spirit. As all parties have agreed  that means the full withdrawal of all military forces from my country to their pre-conflict positions.  The world’s actions proved that the most potent response to this brutal invasion is to rebuild Georgia’s democracy and economy  making them even stronger than before. I want to make a special commitment to all those who  during these especially difficult economic times  are helping to fund Georgia’s reconstruction: we will spend their resources wisely  well and with full transparency.  Georgia will rebuild. It will contribute to the prosperity and security of all its citizens and of the entire international community by providing stability in our part of the world and serving as a model for democratic development. Reconstruction will also ensure that Europe continues to benefit from the true energy security that comes from diversification. And everything we do will be done peacefully.  But today we must ask a series of questions  the answers to which have grave consequences. We have all wondered in recent weeks: was this invasion an aberration or a misguided attempt to resort to the nineteenth-century logic of brute force  or was it a sign of an ominous new trend  one that could continue and deepen to undermine the international order of the twenty-first century  eroding State sovereignty and the power of our common and hard-fought principles? I believe that that question and others have not yet been answered. Others still need to be asked.  Will we encourage violent and hateful separatism around the world  standing aside when State sovereignty is subverted  or will we draw a clear line and defend the principles that uphold the international order and declare  enough? In the twenty-first century  we have better ways to protect the rights of ethnic minorities than with T-72 tanks and Sukhoi fighter jets.  We have developed a body of legal and political examples to accommodate minority demands within the context of national sovereignty. After all  that is one of the great achievements of the United Nations  of the European Union and of other multilateral and regional organizations. Its foundation is the belief that democracy and prosperity provide room for all. Are we ready to throw all that away?   And what of the use of brute force? Will we look the other way or reward the dispatch of tens of thousands of troops and hundreds of planes across internationally recognized borders to bomb another country? Will we cover our eyes when ethnic cleansing occurs  as it has over and over again for the past 16 years in Abkhazia and South Ossetia? In a world that struggles to reign in traditional forms of State violence  will we sanction new ones?  During the invasion of Georgia  we witnessed several terrifying new twists in the waging of war. We saw proxy forces and militias cynically unleashed to ethnically cleanse the population of my country  operating without any restraint and outside any order. We demand a thorough United Nations investigation of the crimes against humanity  war crimes and human rights violations that have been committed.   We have experienced the first full-scale cyber warfare campaign  which was aimed at crippling my country’s economy and our ability to communicate with the outside world. It is profoundly distressing to see the technology that has woven our world together and helped to bridge cultures being used to divide ethnic groups and to tear our world apart.  Today  when most of the world understands the existential threat posed by climate change and ecological destruction  we in Georgia have witnessed a sickening campaign of ecocide as part of the invasion. That occurred when combat helicopter gunships continuously dropped firebombs on old-growth forests in the Borjomi National Park  which comprises our national centre for tourism  recreation  culture and water resources. I believe that  together  we have the solemn responsibility to deliver answers to those questions. We will succeed. Let us resolve to bring the right conclusions to the world.     08-51606 28   The invasion of our country provided an impressive demonstration of the power of global public opinion  which can find expression only when societies are open and free. Ultimately  what stopped the tanks and troops from taking our capital was the international disapproval voiced by so many here  by the free media  by courageous human rights groups and by leading voices of the world’s conscience  from Natan Sharansky to Václav Havel.  Rhetoric  however  is no longer enough; today  we must act. If words were sufficient  then something might have come from the many calls for peace and the countless warnings that I myself have made from this rostrum over the years. No one has fought harder than my country and myself to heal the ethnic rifts in Georgia and to bring about a peaceful resolution of the conflict  and we will continue to fight forcefully.   Indeed  in this very place  I have warned so many times that this situation was in the making — that there was a threat. Four years ago  we were discussing the dangers posed by the illegal Russian build-up in our country aimed at our territories. We spoke about the distribution of passports and about the illegal bases built on our territories. We knew that those subversive tactics  combined with the ethnic cleansing that had driven most Georgians from those territories  would one day be used as a pretext for invasion. And that is precisely what happened last month. It is also happening in other countries in our neighbourhood.  In 2006  I urgently drew attention to the attempts being made to annex Abkhazia and South Ossetia  and I asked whether any members in this great Hall would tolerate such interference by another Power on their own soil. I warned of the risk that “a Pandora’s box will be opened  unleashing violent separatism and conflict not only in the Caucasus but across many parts of our globe” (A/61/PV.16  p. 4). Today  unfortunately  we stand at that very precipice  where peace could yield to a pernicious new world order.  One year ago  I came to this Hall with even more distressing news: that an illegal new military base was being built in South Ossetia by those who hoped that arms and violence could triumph over the will of the people. I noted that that dangerous escalation was taking place under the very noses of the international monitors whose job it was to demilitarize the territory  and I asked that those reckless acts be countered. Our warnings continued in the months and weeks before the invasion. We told anyone who would listen about the campaign that had been unleashed to slander Georgia and my Government while blocking any meaningful negotiations with the separatists. That was part of a calculated effort to weaken international support for Georgia and to lay the groundwork for the invasion.  We gave the international community the details of a sharp military build-up by the purported peacekeepers — a build-up that began this spring in both conflict zones  leading to armed attacks this summer by separatist militias. Just before the land invasion began in the early hours of 7 August  after days of heavy shelling that had killed civilians and peacekeepers  we urgently sought to refute claims that 2 100 South Ossetian civilians had been killed by Georgians. That was the excuse used by the invader for what it called a “humanitarian intervention” — a profound perversion of the responsibility to protect. That lie  which was subsequently debunked by Human Rights Watch — which estimated that 44 had been killed — and others  was an attempt to conceal the true motives for the invasion.  Over the years  I have also spoken many times to you about the plans that Georgia has developed  together with the international community  to peacefully reunify my country. I have spoken about the urgent need to replace and transform the failed frameworks for negotiation and peacekeeping in our region. Repeatedly and with sincere intent  I have extended my hand to our large neighbour.  Just a few days before the invasion of Georgia  we continued to work furiously for peace. The Secretary-General had sent his Special Representative to Georgia to determine how to fix the broken process of conflict resolution  and we cooperated closely with him. The German Government had proposed peace talks for mid-August — talks that my Government eagerly supported. The Finnish Chair of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe also proposed talks in Helsinki in late July  to which we subscribed. Unfortunately  the opposing parties to the conflict repeatedly turned their backs; they had other plans in mind.  Finally  on the eve of the invasion  my Special Envoy travelled twice in desperation to South Ossetia to plead for peace. His counterpart from our neighbouring country failed to come to those meetings. He cited a flat tire as the reason for not showing up.   29 08-51606  Within 24 hours  thousands of very full tires were rolling across the border of my country.  So words alone are not nearly enough. Nor can words accurately convey the horrors of war. It is difficult  if not impossible  to say that anything good can ever come of war. The value of human life is incalculable  and we in Georgia grieve not only for our own lost sons and daughters  but also for our fallen neighbours who were sent in to carry out an unjust aggression of war.   Yet  the international community has emerged from the invasion of my country with something truly valuable: finally  clarity. We understand what has happened. We can no longer deny the motivations and intentions of those actors who instigated the war. With clarity comes responsibility. We no longer have any reason for inaction. Now each of us has a responsibility to act.  Despite the destruction wreaked by the invasion — hundreds dead; nearly 200 000 displaced  according to the United Nations; our economy disabled — my Government is putting our convictions into practice. I promise to you that my Government will implement with all due speed the new democratic initiatives that constitute the second “Rose Revolution”. I promise to you that Georgia will soon be stronger and more democratic than ever before  and thus that it will be in a better position to contribute to our collective security and prosperity.  However  if that is to have any meaning  we must together defend the principles on which this institution was built. We need actions  not words. Allow me to repeat once again the four commitments that  I believe  we must make. First  each of us must refuse to stand silently by in the face of this armed aggression  occupation  ethnic cleansing and assault directed against a United Nations Member State. Secondly  we must stand united in rejecting the forced and illegal recognition of Georgia’s two separatist provinces and what is essentially their annexation by its neighbour. Thirdly  we must ensure that all parties comply fully with the existing ceasefire agreement. Fourthly  we must resolve to create a meaningful conflict resolution process that will peacefully reunify Georgia and resolve the conflict  in the interest of all ethnic groups and minorities  our society as a whole and the region.  If we can accomplish those goals  then this institution will emerge from this crisis stronger than it was before. If  however  we fail to stop the violent tactics that have subverted State sovereignty in Georgia  they will spread to other parts of the world. It is our collective responsibility to respond with conviction and resolve.   Georgia has made its choice  and our democracy will emerge stronger as a result. Together  we will find ways  as we have over the millennia  to ensure peaceful coexistence among all members of our multiethnic society  be they ethnically Georgian  Abkhaz or Ossetian. We have been a Christian country since the fifteenth century  but we are also a country in which many different religious groups and communities coexist. Diversity is our strength  not a source of our weakness. We are willing to strengthen our diversity even further in order to make my country successful and whole once again  rejuvenated and rebuilt."
"63",2621,"GHA",63,2008,"Let me take this opportunity to congratulate you  Mr. President  on your very inspiring statement yesterday (see ). Its   13 08-51749  vision and compassion should provide a framework for the deliberations of the General Assembly into the future.  I should also like to thank the Secretary-General for his unequivocal resolve to use his tenure to provide accountable leadership to this global institution. His call for increased support from all Members in restructuring and streamlining the Secretariat he leads to ensure more flexible  efficient and effective tackling of the many global challenges confronting humankind is timely and must be heeded.  The unmistakable fact of our time is that the world is in a state of flux with unmatched challenges aptly described yesterday by you  Mr. President  as a confluence of large-scale interrelated crises. That is befuddling all nations  strong and weak  rich and poor; but  as you and others have also observed  there are tremendous opportunities as well. Examples of the challenges that practically all previous speakers have alluded to include the phenomenon of climate change and its attendant snow-melts  tsunamis  floods and droughts; the difficult-to-explain turbulence in the crude oil market; the soaring prices of food; the upheavals in the world financial market; the massive trafficking in drugs and weapons; and the spate of harrowing acts of terrorism in many parts of the world. While some of those problems are natural  many of them are man-made.  On the other hand  the advent of information and communication technologies is effecting magical changes in awareness and making time  space and boundaries virtually irrelevant to human interactivity around the world. Discoveries in medicine are improving the quality of life and life expectancy. Fast transportation  dramatic feats in engineering and bioscience technologies with the promise of turning even deserts into productive land are unleashing unimaginable wealth among nations and individuals. Collectively  those opportunities are diffusing power around the world  to such an extent as to negate any idea of a few nations having hegemonic sway in human affairs.  Indeed  the era of the explosion of knowledge can be said to be fulfilling the biblical saying that humankind has been created in the image of God. Humankind is increasingly showing limitless creativity  which inspires a vision that it is indeed capable of overcoming the challenges of our time. However  the problem is one of whether we will curb our self-centredness  greed  bigotry and petty inhumanities to allow for the sharing of the outcomes of that creativity. Left to our individual nations  the peoples of the world will not be high-minded enough. The main challenge then becomes how the various peoples of the world will accept their common humanity as the centrepiece of their endeavours.  There must be leadership  for which the Organization seems to have been created. The founding fathers must have instinctively believed that  with time  the Organization would evolve into a global Government. For even as there were marked geopolitical considerations in the establishment of the United Nations  the Organization was also imbued with a powerful streak of morality. With time  the moral streak has been steadily overcoming the geopolitical dimension. That perception is what must drive the entire membership to accept the call for reform of this global institution and its agencies so as to make them accountable to Members and  in turn  make Members accept their authority and direction.  Indeed  the United Nations is the only Organization in the world with the potential to command respect across the board. Under its auspices  strong and rich nations alike are showing increasing tendencies to share knowledge and finance resources with the weak and poor. Fellow-feeling in international relations is also deepening. It is my belief that it is through the Organization that the world will eventually achieve peace  stability and prosperity  following the menacing flux that engulfs all of us now.  It is the same moral streak embedded in the United Nations that is propelling the development of the various regional blocs around the world. In the case of Africa  dramatic improvements have been made in the last decade and a half. The African Union’s Peer Review Mechanism demonstrates the great resolve of African nations to adhere to the rule of law and good governance. It is noteworthy that  as of now  close to a majority of the membership of the Union has signed up for review. It is also significant that many more African leaders are today acceding to power through the ballot box.  Meanwhile  under the auspices of the New Partnership for Africa’s Development  Africa is trying to pool resources among its members  in partnership with others outside the continent  to exploit its huge    08-51749 14  potential and to develop its markets and its energy  telecommunication  transportation and agriculture sectors  among others. That is the way to solve the many problems of poverty  illiteracy  disease  ignorance and conflict. It is Africa’s initiative to mainstream itself into globalization  and is receiving the support of the international community. Evidence of that includes the many joint conferences held with Japan  China  Brazil and India  as well as Africa’s old allies in Europe and North America.  While we appreciate the support from our development partners  I must say that there is still room for improvement  especially as regards the continent’s efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. The various existing forms of assistance are uncoordinated and insufficiently substantial to achieve the Goals by the target date of 2015. In that regard  the Secretary-General’s call for review and quick delivery of support is timely. As observed in the Accra Accord of the twelfth United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  the whole idea of aid is to empower beneficiary countries to stand on their own feet and to become effective partners in the global market  from which neither rich nor poor countries can abstain  given the increasing interdependence of the world.  In January 2001  I was sworn into office as President of Ghana on a liberal democratic Constitution with the same strong streak of morality that I see in the Charter of the United Nations. The Constitution acknowledges the centrality of humankind in all endeavours; hence the provisions for respect for human rights  the rule of law  gender balance  accountability and transparency in governance.   But  in 2001 the national economy was in bad shape and Ghana had to sign up for the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative (HIPC) in order to access funds for various reconstruction projects for which credit lines were difficult to come by. With national determination and great discipline  the HIPC completion point was achieved in record time to earn debt forgiveness of about $8 billion from bilateral and multilateral creditors. That success has led to increased inflows of domestic and foreign investment that have enabled the Government to launch  among other social services  a free and compulsory universal basic education programme and substantial developments in both the second-cycle and tertiary levels education.   In the health sector  the first-ever national health insurance scheme  including free maternal care  has also begun in Ghana. Concurrently  heavy investments are being made in infrastructure in the transportation  energy and telecommunications sectors in anticipation of accelerated growth in the economy. Meanwhile  a process to modernize the country’s agriculture through mechanization has begun to improve the welfare of the more than 60 per cent of society that is rural and depends on the sector for its livelihood.  By those policies  among others  the nation is now in sight of attaining its ambitious vision of middle income status by 2015  which is also the target date for the Millennium Development Goals. Those developments have been crowned by the discovery of oil in commercial quantities  which the Government is determined to make a blessing for the whole nation of Ghana  rather than a curse.  That is the Ghana story as my term of office comes to a close at the end of this year. The moral I glean from the story is that development in freedom is possible. In other words  accelerated national development and good governance  including respect for fundamental human rights  are not mutually exclusive. Indeed  good governance should hasten development. "
"64",2667,"GIN",63,2008,"I would like to discharge my first duty by conveying to the    08-52265 38  Assembly  on behalf of His Excellency the President of the Republic of Guinea  General Lansana Conté  whom I am honoured to represent here  brotherly greetings along with a strong message of solidarity from the people of Guinea. On this solemn occasion  I am also pleased to convey to Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann the warmest congratulations of the Guinean Government following the election of a charismatic and enlightened individual of his stature to the presidency of the Assembly. I assure him of Guinea’s full and entire cooperation throughout his mandate.   I would also like to take this opportunity to express my country’s gratitude to his illustrious predecessor for the skill with which he handled the presidency of the sixty-second session. To the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  we once again convey our deepest appreciation for the effectiveness and vision with which he leads the work of our Organization  which is ever more in demand  because of the many challenges we face in shaping a world of peace  security  justice and prosperity for all.   With regard to international solidarity  34 years ago the dominant groups of the world promised to implement the noble commitment made by the international community to eliminate the poverty that undermines living conditions in poor countries  in particular through the regular allocation of 0.7 per cent of the gross domestic product of industrialized countries to official development assistance.  In the euphoric wake of the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989  that promise had received only a symbolic fulfilment when the leading powers predicted  in a premature burst of triumphalism  that budgets that had been devoted until then to the arms race would  as of then  be devoted to expediting poverty eradication. However  the current configuration of our world  deeply divided as it is between rich and poor  shows multiple signs of how those promises —which  when they were made  awakened great hopes for the rapid achievement of an international world of peace  effective solidarity and shared well-being — have not been fulfilled.  With regard to international peace  in spite of the significant reduction in the current number of armed conflicts  fears remain. Indeed  military expenditures have increased significantly in recent years to proportions that hearken back to the darkest hours of the cold war  times that we had hoped were left far behind us.   The legitimate war against blind and unacceptable terrorism  waged on several fronts since 2001  is unfortunately far from reassuring. The anachronistic Israeli-Palestinian conflict persists in spite of the welcome decision to seek a negotiated settlement of that dispute. Tensions related to nuclear weapons control darken the horizon of a lasting international peace. Hegemonistic urges to control the strategic resources of the planet are obvious in various instances  raising legitimate fears for the security of those countries that are vulnerable in military terms.   When it comes to combating global hunger  the current food crisis poses an urgent and pressing challenge that demands a rapid response at the national  regional and international levels. Beyond the emergency  solidarity-based movement that has taken shape  that serious phenomenon requires a global  long-term approach from us all. To that end  the international community as a whole must promote policies and strategies geared towards returning agriculture to the heart of our national and international concerns. Our ability to satisfy the food needs of the most vulnerable peoples and to preserve socio-political stability in those countries depends on it.   With regard to poverty reduction  the results remain mixed  unfortunately. Indeed  poor countries are foundering even further  due not only to their population growth and insufficient social investments  but also to the inadequate quality and inconsistency of official development assistance. In addition  all of that must be viewed against the backdrop of the all-too-timid engagement of their development partners and of global trade conditions that place them at a disadvantage.   Currently  halfway to the 2015 deadline  official development assistance is still not being allocated at the necessary pace. In spite of demonstrating their full resolve to take control of their destiny by enacting robust measures in terms of political  economic and financial governance  poor countries must make do with the drafting of new versions of poverty reduction strategy papers that are unlikely to be implemented because of the lack of sufficient and appropriate financing.    39 08-52265   Meanwhile  the populations of poor countries continue to increase and to grow younger. They grow impatient with the delay and slowness of their integration into globalization. Their social needs are growing and their institutional stability  prospects for democracy and likelihood of sustainable social peace are faltering. The picture is one of a vicious circle within which the leaders and peoples of poor countries are caught. They look to their partners for an extension of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative and the removal of the obstacles that impede the export of their products in order to enable their economies to escape marginalization in the global trade system.   In that context  the Guinean Government urges the implementation of the outcomes of high-level meetings with respect to the priority agenda of international development agencies. Those outcomes outline approaches and steps that could improve the living conditions of hundreds of millions of individuals  particularly in Africa  who feel the full impact of extreme poverty  illiteracy  endemic diseases  insecurity  economic marginalization and socio-political exclusion.   Elected in April 2008 in Dakar to chair the Leading Group on Solidarity Development Levies  Guinea devotes all its energies to consolidating initiatives in that field and to overseeing the design and implementation of programmes that will serve to supplement traditional financing sources. I appeal to Member States and to development partners to join us in that solidarity initiative in order to pool our collective efforts to fight poverty and achieve our common goals.   From this rostrum of international solidarity  I have the pleasure of calling on global leaders  in particular those of the wealthy and emerging countries  to increase their support for poor countries  as the community of humankind must preserve its meaning  human solidarity must show its effectiveness  and humankind must share the certain knowledge that lasting peace cannot be forged within the current asymmetrical divisions of our world.   More resolute than ever before to make proper use of the official development assistance that they will receive  the populations of poor countries are determined to emerge from the poverty afflicting them. Their young people want to make their parents and their countries proud by finding decent work at home. They do not want to get involved in clandestine immigration networks  nor do they want to deal with drug traffickers.  Encouraging results have been achieved in conflict prevention and in restoring  maintaining and building peace in the world  and in Africa in particular  in spite of the human tragedies taking place in Darfur. Our Organization deserves to be congratulated and encouraged for that. Indeed  significant progress has been achieved by Côte d’Ivoire on the path towards restoring peace and national reconciliation.   With regard to the Mano River Union  Guinea calls on the international community to continue to support the efforts of the member States of that organization in order to prevent them from relapsing into the cycle of doubt  insecurity and instability. We must also welcome the successful measures initiated and led by the Peacebuilding Commission to consolidate stability in Sierra Leone  Liberia and Guinea-Bissau.   In the Horn of Africa and in the Western Sahara  through the perseverance of the United Nations and the stakeholders in those crises  positive signs of settlement are emerging. We urge all the stakeholders in those crises to engage in dialogue and coordination  which  if they are to be effective  require  of course  respect for the commitments that have been made.   In the Middle East  it is obvious that resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict will require a regional solution based on the creation of an independent  sovereign and viable Palestinian State living side by side and in peace with Israel in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and the Quartet road map.   Moreover  Guinea reaffirms its unwavering commitment to the principle of a single and undivided China.  I would now like to address the situation in my country  which for the past two years has faced a serious economic and social crisis  triggered by a combination of internal and external factors  which I have just described. I am pleased to be able to say today that through a national patriotic upsurge  supported by the efforts of the international community  including the Economic Community of West African States  that situation is on the path towards normalization and improvement. A    08-52265 40  Government open to all stakeholders  comprising the opposition  civil society and the two sides of industry  has been established. That Government has drawn up and is currently implementing a minimum emergency programme that should pave the way for a relaunch of the country’s economic and social development process in the near future.   In spite of the pitfalls and unstable resources  the results obtained to date are encouraging. The institutional framework for governance is improving. The pace of the democratic process  in particular the preparation for legislative elections  is quickening. The independent national electoral commission is up and running. The political parties have received subsidies for election preparations. A comprehensive coordination movement involving all components of the nation is under way. The mining agreements are being revised with a view to protecting the interests of the country and  naturally  those of the investors themselves. Economic and financial governance is being strengthened  sanctioned by the adoption on 28 July 2008  by the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund  of the conclusions of the first review of the formal programme  which should lead our country to the completion point under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative.  Working together with all actors in the nation  the Guinean Government remains firmly committed to shouldering its full share of responsibility in tackling the huge challenges posed by HIV/AIDS  drugs  lack of security  terrorism  the illicit circulation of light weapons and the structural causes underlying clandestine immigration. The eradication of poverty  maintenance of peace  institutional stability and promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms lie at the heart of our national priorities.  Sixty-three years after the establishment of the United Nations  eight years after the adoption of the United Nations Millennium Declaration and at the midpoint towards the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals  my country  Guinea  believes in the future of a world of greater solidarity  justice and fairness  thus safer in the context of a true and fair partnership. A reformed  revitalized United Nations  adapted to new developments  remains the appropriate forum to meet the challenges that we all face.  Before I conclude  I am pleased to report that 2008 marks the fiftieth anniversary of both our country’s independence and its accession the United Nations. That gives me the opportunity to reaffirm to my country’s firm commitment  alongside the rest of the international community  to achieving the noble ideals of our Organization  and to supporting and respecting all its principles and purposes  which are the foundation of a true community of destiny.  "
"65",2706,"GMB",63,2008,"I bring to everyone here greetings from His Excellency Al Hadji Yahya A.J.J. Jammeh  President and head of State of the Republic of the Gambia.   The legitimacy of multilateralism  which lies at the core of the United Nations system  is being increasingly questioned. Yes  with the launching of the former Secretary-General’s report “In larger freedom: towards development  security and human rights for all” (A/59/2005)  a lot of reforms have taken place and are still taking place. However  the question is  “Is it enough?” One of the unassailable conclusions reached in that report is that “no reform of the United Nations would be complete without reform of the Security Council” (A/59/2005  para. 169). We have established a new Human Rights Council and the Peacebuilding Commission and have undertaken far-reaching management reforms  yet the reform of the Security Council is still being unnecessarily stalled for no justifiable reason. That delay constitutes a source of frustration for the citizens of this world  who are increasingly questioning the legitimacy of our decisions. The world is watching the unsatisfactory status quo with dismay.   In any event  the aspirations of the African people and their Governments to adequate representation on the Council cannot be ignored because they are legitimate and justified. The suggestion that reforming the Council’s working methods alone could constitute sufficient reform is not accurate.  A/63/PV.13 29 08-53122   My delegation has taken note of the High-level Panel’s report and the Secretary-General’s comment on United Nations system-wide coherence  as well as the concept paper on institutional options to strengthen United Nations work on gender equality and the empowerment of women. My delegation aligns itself with the position of the Group of 77 and China on that work in progress.  Our world is also going through a period of crises  ranging from the food crisis and the energy crisis to the collapse of financial markets and the collapse of trade talks. There is no country on Earth that is not affected by those crises. Too many repetitive high-level meetings  too many false promises and unfulfilled commitments continue to characterize our efforts to address the global crises. We in the developing world have received too many prescriptions from the international community and we have fastidiously followed them. The irony  however  remains that our partners are not fulfilling their side of the bargain in the way they should. It is our hope that the upcoming Follow-up International Conference on Financing for Development to Review the Implementation of the Monterrey Consensus  to be held in Doha this November  will result in the reversal of that trend.  We are asked to eliminate subsidies while our partners in the North continue to give huge subsidies to their farmers. We are opening up our markets while they continue to introduce subtle measures including tariff and non-tariff barriers to deny us effective market access. They commit to doubling overseas development assistance  but turn around and withhold the little that trickles in. When it trickles in  it becomes a media event. That is no way to end poverty. That is no way to end the food crisis. That is no way to end the energy crisis. Certainly  that is no way to address climate change  and it is no way to achieve the Millennium Development Goals.  Allow me to share some thoughts about the global food crisis. When the crisis struck earlier this year  no economy was spared. The food crisis was predictable because the international community over the past decade has neglected agriculture in the developing countries. In most developing countries  agricultural research and training institutions collapsed  largely because of underfunding. Research and development were outsourced to multinational corporations. Most of us in the developing world saw the collapse of our agriculture markets through competition from the heavily subsidized farmers of the developed world. World trade talks keep on failing  to the detriment of poor farmers in rural Africa and elsewhere in the developing world.  Our response to the food crisis followed the usual pattern of convening conferences and meetings and adopting blueprints that merely heal the symptoms. We need more than that. How many times have we met in Rome and elsewhere just to adopt the same commitments that we have already adopted over the years? Our farmers need agricultural inputs  such as machinery and fertilizers  to enhance their production capacity. We all know what is at stake. Let us honour our commitments in order not to repeat the dramatic events that stem from food shortages.   As we address the food crisis  we cannot underestimate the impact of skyrocketing energy costs on the incomes and livelihoods of our populations. Our economies are under enormous stress and our gains in economic growth and development are at risk of being completely eroded. We appreciate the efforts that a number of energy-producing countries are making to ease the impact of the crisis on net importing countries. Our delegation believes  however  that sustained efforts should continue to be made to stabilize the oil market. Beyond tackling the economic crisis that is impacting the world  we should also pay attention to the question of conflict resolution in various conflict areas.  One of the cornerstones of the Gambia’s foreign policy is the pursuit of peace and security. As a peace-loving people  it is our constant desire to contribute to the search for lasting peace wherever there is conflict. It is for those reasons that the Gambia actively participates in peace missions and promotes good-neighbourliness  friendship and cooperation throughout Africa and beyond.   I must register my satisfaction at the peace dividend that is being reaped today across Africa thanks to the commitment of African leaders to finding solutions to African conflicts. We are witnessing the resurgence of hope in Sierra Leone and Liberia after many years of consolidation of peace and security. It is my delegation’s fervent hope that the international community will not relent in extending to them all the financial  technical and material support they require to turn their societies around for the better. A/63/PV.13   08-53122 30   The Gambian delegation fully shares the agony of the Somali Government and people over the breakdown of law and order and the internal conflict that continues to plague that country. In that regard  I wish to salute the effort that the Government and the people of Ethiopia  the neighbouring countries and the African Union are making in trying to bring peace and security to Somalia.   It is the strong desire of my delegation to see a peaceful settlement of the conflict in Darfur. As a troop-contributing country to the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur  we humbly call on all the parties to iron out their differences at the negotiating table. Regarding the threat to indict President Al-Bashir of the Sudan  the Gambia wishes to register its full support for the position taken on the matter by the African Union  the League of Arab States and the Non-Aligned Movement.  The people of the Middle East are tired of living in a theatre of conflict. The Palestinian conflict has lingered for too long and the condition of ordinary Palestinians continues to deteriorate even after numerous accords and promises. General Assembly resolutions  Security Council resolutions and even the recent International Court of Justice advisory opinion on the situation are not being implemented. The Quartet and the international community seem helpless. We must ask ourselves: “How do we respond to the despair and lack of action that seem to characterize the peace agenda of the United Nations in that region? When will the two-State solution be achieved?” Unless we do something to break the logjam in the ongoing negotiations  lasting peace will remain elusive.  Iraq and Afghanistan continue to roil in conflict. The international community must give the Governments of those countries space to make decisions that are in the best interests of their peoples.   Allow me now to address some neglected issues of international justice. My delegation has always addressed the question of Taiwan in this Assembly from the point of view of justice  fairness and equality. Taiwan is a stable and prosperous democracy that is willing and able to take part in the work that the Organization does. How can one justify the exclusion of Taiwan from actively participating in the activities of United Nations agencies? Safeguarding the welfare of the 23 million Taiwanese through their participation should be accepted under the principle of universality. For example  although it has the world’s tenth largest shipping capacity  Taiwan does not have access to the International Maritime Organization. That adversely affects the progress of its shipping industry.   Furthermore  as the world’s eighth largest economy and twentieth largest foreign investor  Taiwan possesses significant economic strength and continues to share its development experiences with many developing countries through technical and humanitarian assistance. Taiwan is supporting the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals and other internationally agreed development goals. I therefore strongly believe that we should all agree to let Taiwan participate in the activities of the specialized agencies of the United Nations. That is a modest request that my delegation fervently hopes merits the Assembly’s objective consideration.  The perpetuation of the unjust extraterritorial economic embargo against Cuba has never made sense  does not make sense today and has no place in our community of nations. Its sole objective is to inflict unnecessary harm and suffering on a resolute people. The General Assembly’s persistent calls for its abolition have only met with indifference. At their hour of need  when hurricanes Ike and Gustav inflicted massive damage on the country  Cuba’s humanitarian call for the lifting of the embargo to enable it to purchase necessary humanitarian supplies has met with nothing but a cold response. There is no room for such action in the twenty-first century. The embargo must end.  I would like to address a number of social issues that are very high on the global agenda. In Africa  we are committed to combating the scourges of HIV/AIDS  tuberculosis  malaria and other infectious diseases. Over the years  African Governments have committed substantial resources to fighting those diseases. Yet  our health-care delivery systems remain under serious stress because of the flight of trained professionals to more advanced countries. That is considered to be positive migration  but we are being devastated by it. I think some serious dialogue needs to begin between our countries and beneficiary States on how to get fair compensation for such huge losses.  The other side of migration is what some call “illegal” migration  especially from Africa to Europe. It is a question that is tied to the problem of youth  A/63/PV.13 31 08-53122  unemployment in our societies and to the broader question of development. Over the years  we have tried to address the migration conundrum at various forums  but we need to come up with solutions that empower young people through job creation  skills and vocational training programmes in order to stem the tide. Governments must manage migration humanely. The human rights and welfare of migrants and their families should be upheld by all societies. My delegation would like to appeal to all Governments to do more to stamp out the increasing rise of intolerance  xenophobia and racism directed against migrants and their families.  Ours is a world of considerable opportunities and challenges. Let us collectively exploit the opportunities offered by our globalized world to tackle the challenges that face humankind. Together  we can do it. "
"66",2746,"GNB",63,2008,"It is with great pleasure that I extend my warmest congratulations to Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session. In electing him amidst this rather complex global scenario  the international community places confidence in his qualities as a statesman  a spiritual leader and a defender of the most disenfranchised.  For my part  I am convinced that the experience that Mr. d’Escoto Brockmann gained at a historic time and in the particular circumstances in the lives of the friendly people of Nicaragua will serve him well in analysing and better understanding the challenges we face in this  the first decade of the twenty-first century. I count on his wisdom and balance  in the conviction that spiritual force will always inspire him and help him preside over our deliberations with success. He can count on my personal support and on the cooperation of the delegation of my country  Guinea-Bissau.  Allow me also to thank his predecessor for the results achieved at the last session. I would also like to express our appreciation to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his dedication and for the spirit of innovation he has shown in fulfilling his duties. His report on the international situation (A/63/1) emphasizes the gravity of the major challenges the world is facing as well as the complexity of the reforms that are needed to improve the functioning and efficiency of the Organization and the working conditions for its staff.  We agree with him that in order to more efficiently solve the numerous problems of our planet  we need an organization which is less bureaucratic  capable of adopting new technologies and possessing sufficient financial means and competent and highly motivated staff. We support the efforts of the Secretary-General with a view to increasing the Organization’s capacity to maintain peace and to address global issues. We also support his proposal to introduce  in the Secretariat in particular  new working methods based not only on the recognition of individual skills  but also on an emphasis on teamwork.  The present international situation demands serious reflection about the cause of the present crisis which greatly affects our countries. The three main elements of the crisis — energy  food and international finances  to which we would add the disastrous consequences of climate change — call for a better coordination of our efforts in the pursuit of innovative  courageous and adequate solutions leading to the establishment of a new world order  one which is more just and equitable and which is capable of responding to the realities of an interdependent and globalized world.  The increase in oil prices has destabilizing effects on our economies. The cost of producing electrical energy in particular has become an unsustainable burden for the poor countries and a major obstacle to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.  In my country  Guinea-Bissau  for example  the lack of energy seriously compromises all socio-economic activities  particularly hospital care and the distribution of drinking water  which is essential for guaranteeing hygiene and public health. How can a poor country like ours face the unjustified increase in the price of oil? What means do we have at our disposal to face the adverse consequences of a system which has been poorly based on speculation and which has nothing to do with the law of supply and demand? Is it not the right time for us to think about creating a world fund to mitigate the effects that are jeopardizing our ability to reach the Millennium Development Goals? How can we invest in and improve our infrastructure in such vital areas as health  education and agriculture if we are continuously compelled to spend enormous resources from our already limited funding to purchase fuel?  Moreover  the tremendous increase in food prices on the international market and the hunger and malnutrition which could affect many countries  in Africa in particular  are also matters of great concern and impel us to take action and implement appropriate agricultural policies with sufficient financial means so that we can invest in the creation of modern and affordable means of production.  Saying that agriculture is a priority should not be a mere slogan. We need to be reminded that the right to food is a fundamental right and is enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  whose sixtieth anniversary we are celebrating this year. Every country should be able to guarantee food autonomy. We therefore need to examine and reformulate conditions for obtaining agricultural credits in particular.   5 08-51851   A food shortage can pose a serious threat to the peace and security of a country. At the international level  we need to seriously discuss how to improve our capacity to respond effectively to the food crisis by putting into practice new scientific knowledge and by applying technologies suited to the climate conditions of the various regions of our planet and to the social and economic realities of our respective peoples.  In an interdependent and globalized world  we have to strive to establish and ensure respect for rules capable of regulating the international  financial and trading system without impeding the free flow of capital. But the international financial system  which is already affected by serious distortions  cannot be based only on a quest for speculative profit and on unlawful behaviour  which can have enormous consequences  as is the case now in many countries  where thousands of families have financial difficulties  particularly in the area of housing credits. Unfortunately  the consequences of these poor practices are not limited to a few countries.  The international community must react to all of these challenges. But how can we succeed without close cooperation among all countries of the world? We need cooperation in order to face climate change and to mitigate the effects of natural disasters such as the terrible hurricanes which have caused so much destruction in countries in the Caribbean  such as Cuba and Haiti  and also in Houston  Texas.   Our main goal should be to foster dialogue in all circumstances — dialogue among the countries  peoples  cultures  religions and civilizations of the world. It is only through dialogue that we will be able to identify our differences and find solutions in our common interest.   We need dialogue and negotiation at the international level to prevent and solve conflicts  such as the conflict in the Middle East  and to preserve the lives of human beings in danger  in Darfur and in Somalia  for example. We need dialogue and negotiation to defend and protect the most vulnerable  in particular women and children  by promoting and ensuring respect for human rights  the principle of democracy and the rule of law.  At the national level  we need dialogue aimed at creating appropriate conditions for the consolidation of democracy through free  transparent and credible elections  as we intend to do in Guinea-Bissau on 16 November.   Finally  we should further dialogue and negotiations with the view to promoting a policy of inclusion that guarantees the active participation of all stakeholders  above all women and youth  and civil society in general  in building peace and political stability and in creating the necessary conditions for development.  Although confronted with complex international situations  the international community has ways of facing those challenges. However  real political will is needed from us all. The United Nations can play an even more decisive role in preventing and resolving conflicts  in protecting our planet and in creating better living conditions for millions of people. Thus we need a United Nations that is better organized  less bureaucratic and better suited to confronting those many challenges.  We reiterate our full support for the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  in the implementation of much-needed reforms for the greater efficiency  capacity to respond and credibility of the United Nations. We equally support the reform process undertaken by the Member States of our Organization in order to democratize the United Nations system  in particular the Security Council  the enlargement of which remains a priority for us all  considering the new economical and political reality of today’s world and above all the need to address the historic injustice done to the continent of Africa for more than 60 years."
"67",2785,"GNQ",63,2008,"First of all  on behalf of the people of Equatorial Guinea and the delegation with me today  I should like to congratulate Mr. D’Escoto Brockmann on his fitting election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session. His election bears   17 08-51845  witness to the trust and credibility with which all States Members of the United Nations view the sister Republic of Nicaragua. We wish him every success and assure him of our full cooperation during his time in office.  I would also like to pay tribute to the outgoing President  Mr. Srgjan Kerim  for the excellent work he carried out at a crucial time in the history of the United Nations.  The sixty-third session allows us a new opportunity to share our views on the common concerns of all peoples in the world. We would like to say how pleased we are to see that the agenda of this annual debate includes subjects such as the democratization of the United Nations system  including the necessary reforms in the functioning of the Security Council and the Bretton Woods institutions; funding for the development of Africa; the food crisis and world hunger; climate change; human security as part of international peace and security; and the fight against terrorism.  The world harboured the hope that after the cold war mankind would achieve peace and live more harmoniously together in greater solidarity. However  we are extremely saddened to note the differences separating the rich from the poor countries  causing hunger  poverty  war and destabilization. In other words  today we are facing new challenges that jeopardize the budding institutions of developing countries in many ways.   For that reason  it is necessary to adopt mechanisms and strategies that enable us to ensure that our experiences can provide a bridge to a new form of cooperation among peoples. Indeed  in the six decades of the existence of the United Nations  we have seen that only the establishment of a new  more open and respectful global framework for cooperation will lead to the stability  peace and progress of all nations.  We have seen that the use of force by the strong has not only failed to solve the problems affecting the people of the world today  but has made them worse. We know from experience that conflicts and threats to world peace arise from a patent lack of dialogue among the countries making up the international community. Not only do many peoples and nations continue to face old conflicts  but every day new tensions and threats to world peace emerge.   In addition to those challenges are the issues that are the focus of our debate  such as injustice  poverty  the energy and food crises  climate change  inequality and poor access to the education  health care and new technologies needed for poor countries to develop.   Thus  Equatorial Guinea believes it appropriate that the new strategy the world needs today must start not only with the reform of our multilateral cooperation institutions  but also with a change in the mentality and behaviour of those who today hold economic power  so as to achieve a manifestation of democracy that fosters dialogue and cooperation among peoples.  In the recent past  our efforts to bring about a better world have been based on the Millennium Development Goals  which were intended to strengthen international cooperation towards universal and sustainable development. Achieving those Goals requires  inter alia  the reform of the world economic system  based on respect for different development models  so that each may choose what is most historically  politically  socially and culturally fitting.   Clearly  that troubled global situation affects all countries to different degrees and with varying impact. In that regard  the African continent is the most vulnerable in terms of economic and social development  and it is not surprising that its peoples are more affected by the widespread crisis threatening the world.  That which is presented to us today as a world food crisis is not merely temporary but is one of the many paradoxes of our time. For it seems inconceivable that in an era of abundance the underdeveloped countries of the South are confronted by a deficit in a right so crucial to human beings  namely  the right to food. Statistics published by the Food and Agriculture Organization indicate that nearly 900 million men  women and children suffer from hunger  with almost 80 per cent of them living in developing countries.   The supposed food crisis and other current phenomena in our globalized world are the result of the impact of the neoliberal policies that have been applied on a global scale for more than four decades. I am speaking in particular about the prescriptions advanced by institutions of the international commercial and financial system  namely  the World Bank  the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade    08-51845 18  Organization. In fact  they act as the voice of their masters in erecting discriminatory barriers that impede our ability to produce and trade.  One of the consequences of the food crisis has been the no-holds-barred liberalization of trade imposed by those institutions. That has permitted the flooding of African markets with highly subsidized food products  which is destroying agriculture in our countries. In that regard  Africa today is a continent that produces and exports things that it itself does not consume  while at the same time it imports from the countries of the North things that it could produce for its own use but does not.   If there is any good in the food crisis it is the fact that none of the countries of the South  and especially those in Africa  has any interest in continuing to depend upon food imports in order to ensure the survival of its citizens  either as food aid or through an unfair trading system. In that connection  what Africa needs today is development based on solidarity and the strengthening of its socio-economic fabric. A large part of Africa’s fertile land is still not cultivated  but statistics on Africa’s productivity are among the lowest in the world. That is due to the exodus from the countryside and the few incentives available to farmers because of the high cost of agricultural inputs and the relative prices of agricultural products on the international market.   With regard to the New Partnership for Africa’s Development and the delay in its implementation  Equatorial Guinea would like to propose the establishment of an international steering committee made up of experts from both donor and African countries. The purpose of the committee would be to identify mechanisms and projects that could contribute to the economic integration of African countries. The committee would also be in charge of implementing projects and programmes at the continental  regional and subregional levels  including the programme to combat HIV/AIDS  malaria  tuberculosis and other diseases endemic in Africa; identifying and financing of energy resources in order to electrify countries in landlocked regions; building a trans-African network of roads and railways so that countries that are enclaves and without access to the sea can transport their goods; launching a satellite that ensures communications for Africa; establishing an African university to train our human resources; establishing industries in countries experiencing emigration to developed countries in order to create jobs for their workforce; and granting low-interest loans in order to promote development in Africa’s least favoured countries.   I should like to conclude my statement by recalling the commitment of the international community to preserve the environment and protect ecosystems that have an impact on climate change  which today poses a threat to humankind. Equatorial Guinea is among the countries of equatorial Africa making great efforts to preserve the forest ecosystems of the Congo River basin  which  along with the Amazon  serves as the lungs of humankind.   Moreover  Equatorial Guinea would like to reiterate its commitment to combating international terrorism and organized crime in all their forms and manifestations.   With regard to national policy  Equatorial Guinea is experiencing an unprecedented period of freedom and development. Our people are flourishing and developing in an atmosphere of peace  democracy and stability. We look forward to a future of well-being and justice for all our citizens.   From this podium  I would like to reiterate the commitment of my Government to promote and protect human rights. We do not need anyone to give us lessons about elections  or to attempt to usurp the sovereign will of the people of Equatorial Guinea.   Equatorial Guinea is proud to be part of the United Nations. We believe this universal Organization is today  and will continue to be  the sole option for strengthening peace and stability and for achieving development  to which we all aspire. "
"68",2831,"GRC",63,2008,"Sophocles said that all mankind is subject to error. We are gathered here in this Assembly in order to limit the scope of those errors and to ensure respect for the mandate of the United Nations. My Government fully agrees with the objectives and ideas expressed by President Nicolas Sarkozy as President of the European Union (see ).   There is much that remains to be done and many obstacles to be overcome: armed conflict  hunger  poverty  environmental degradation  terrorism  organized crime  human trafficking  lack of respect for human rights and the abuse of power. All these things threaten what we wish to build in the United Nations: a community of States that enjoys progress  peace and prosperity.   Add the economic crisis the world faces now to those scourges  and it becomes difficult not to see the future as dark and menacing. As the poet Yeats described  we live in a world where (spoke in English) “The best lack all conviction  while the worst are full of passionate intensity.” (spoke in French)  During this critical period  every country must make a choice: either to focus solely on its own limited interests and promote nationalistic ends in order to distract people’s attention from danger throughout the world  or to look outwards  to open its mind and borders and to commit to warning people that the only way to face threats successfully is to do so together.  The history of Greece and the character of the Greek people are such that we have chosen the second path. It was in ancient Greece that society for the first time developed those ideals that are cherished today by free people throughout the world: democracy  equality and individual rights. More recently  we have lived through several wars  poverty and deprivation. Nevertheless  we endured  and we have been able once again to grab hold of the ideas that we were the first to profess.  We have not forgotten  however  what it is like to feel fear and need. This is why we will continue to work closely with all States  organizations and institutions to ensure that all people can live in security and can prosper and thrive.  The United Nations must be at the helm of this effort. In order to play its role efficiently  the United Nations needs increased support from us all  particularly in its efforts to develop and improve. Discussions about Security Council reforms and the need to breathe new life into the General Assembly have been going on for far too long. We hope that  starting at this session  today  concrete measures will be adopted to reach our objective. (spoke in English)  This year we celebrate the sixtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Unfortunately  gross violations of human rights persist throughout the world  and we Member States need to redouble our efforts to reduce them. The Human Rights Council could be a powerful force in that struggle  and Greece has decided to become a candidate for membership for the term beginning in 2012. We ask for the Assembly’s support and trust.  Along with protecting human rights  the United Nations must strengthen its efforts to alleviate the bitter poverty that still grips many parts of the world. We need to increase trade for development  and we regret the lack of progress in the Doha Round. In 2000  we agreed on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  probably the most ambitious development project ever undertaken by man. In terms of time  we are halfway there. Yet a lot remains to be done. The progress achieved so far is jeopardized by higher prices  particularly for food and oil  and the global economic slowdown. Our success will be judged primarily in Africa.  We believe that one way to help jumpstart development in Africa is to involve women in the economy more extensively. Providing entrepreneurial    08-53129 22  opportunities to women at local  national and regional levels will allow them to strengthen their role in society  increase their involvement in education and ultimately allow them to play a more active part in decision-making. As the French social theorist Charles Fourier said more than 200 years ago  “The extension of women’s rights is the basic principle of all social progress.”  The challenge of climate change  if not addressed  threatens not only the MDGs but also the economic and social stability of our world. We have to achieve  in 2009  a new  truly global agreement with ambitious  binding mitigation targets. We also need a much stronger effort on adaptation  where there is a huge deficit between the needs and the actual financing provided. That deficit is exacerbated by the fact that no matter what we do  we are locked in for significant climate change in the next three to four decades  which is going to especially affect the less developed countries. It is an unjust reality that those that are least to blame for the creation of the problem are to suffer most.  Greece is moving to face this challenge. We have signed  this week in New York  agreements with the African Union and the Caribbean Community for the funding of adaptation projects  and we plan to do the same with the Alliance of Small Island States  providing a total of €20 million for the next four years. One might argue that this is just a drop in the adaptation bucket. It is  however  a drop in an empty bucket.  Migration is a critical element in the development of neglected regions  and the United Nations High-level Dialogue on International Migration and Development has taken the lead in dramatizing the link. By hosting the third Global Forum on Migration and Development in the fall of 2009  Greece aims to provide a platform on which to explore solutions and initiatives for the benefit of all countries and especially for the immigrants themselves.  As heartbreaking as the suffering of immigrants and refugees often is  nothing can compare to the misery involved in human trafficking. Young women who leave their homes in search of a better livelihood are exploited  brutalized and forced into a life of unspeakable depravity by the traffickers in human misery who are involved in the international sex trade. I say it is time for the international community to say “Enough!” I urge all the members of the United Nations to begin working together forcefully to put an end to this blight on human dignity.  Along with protecting the weak and vulnerable  the United Nations has the responsibility to act forcefully and to protect the world from the kind of fanaticism and extremism that cripples any social programme. Terrorism poses a major threat to the security of our countries  to the stability of our democratic societies and to the rights and freedoms of our citizens. Around the world  whether in Afghanistan or Pakistan  Iraq or Yemen  the international community must show its strong commitment to combating terrorism while protecting human rights and the rule of law.  On regional security  Greece is preparing to assume the chairmanship of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) next January. The OSCE — the world’s largest regional security organization — can be a forum for frank and fruitful talks on security issues and can contribute effectively to such crucial concerns as early warning  conflict prevention  crisis management and post-conflict rehabilitation. Finland  the current Chair  has made a major effort to promote positive discussions among the OSCE States  and Greece intends to continue that policy and try to resolve outstanding issues.  The crisis in South Ossetia has created a volatile situation that affects stability in all the South Caucasus and has exacerbated international tension. Greece’s position on that crisis is rooted in the principles that have always guided our foreign policy — peaceful settlement of disputes and respect for the sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity of States. In both the European Union (EU) and NATO  we supported the six-point agreement that helped end conflict in the area  but we are anxious to see measures that will alleviate the anger and mistrust that now pervade the region.  In the broader Middle East  the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is at the root of most of the problems  and the region requires a comprehensive and lasting solution. I think that we all agree that the peace process relaunched last year at the Annapolis conference has the potential to achieve tangible results and merits the strong support of all of us.  In Lebanon  we welcome the presidential election  the formation of the National Unity 43  23 08-53129  Government and the resumption of the national dialogue. Lebanon’s sovereignty and territorial integrity should be respected  in conformity with the relevant Security Council resolutions.  Turning to our immediate neighbourhood  Greece is committed to a South-Eastern Europe where all countries belong to the European and Euro-Atlantic families. We were as pleased to welcome Croatia and Albania to NATO a few months ago as we were to welcome Bulgaria and Romania to the European Union last year. We have been encouraged also by the recent developments in Serbia  a country which grows closer to Europe every day.  In the same spirit  we agree with our NATO allies and European Union partners that invitations to the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia should be extended when a mutually acceptable solution is reached on the name issue. Greece will continue to be guided by the letter and the spirit of Security Council resolutions 817 (1993) and 845 (1993) on that issue  and I want to take this opportunity to express our appreciation to the Secretary-General and his Personal Envoy  Mr. Matthew Nimetz  for their commitment and their tireless efforts to settle the dispute.  The new reality of Kosovo requires continued attention from the international community. The United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo has done a good job providing security for Kosovo’s population  and its successor  the European Union Rule of Law Mission Kosovo  should assume its responsibilities as soon as possible.  Beyond the Western Balkans  Greece continues taking fruitful initiatives in the spirit of international law and the United Nations Charter to broaden and strengthen cooperation with Turkey. We are convinced that modern Turkey  with a clear European orientation  will add to the stability of our region. We therefore support the European aspirations of Turkey as it moves to meet the prerequisites set out in the negotiating framework of the European Union. But words must be matched with deeds. The principles of good-neighbourly relations and peaceful settlement of disputes with other nations are essential preconditions. Yet 34 years after the 1974 invasion of Cyprus  a sovereign United Nations and European Union member State  Turkey continues to occupy over one third of the island’s territory with nearly 40 000 troops. That unacceptable situation is a flagrant violation of international law  a threat to the security and welfare of Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots alike  and a serious obstacle to the stabilization of the region.  Greece has consistently supported Cyprus in its natural and justified desire to see the withdrawal of all occupation forces as part of a settlement for its reunification as a bizonal  bicommunal federation with intercommunal equality  a single sovereignty  a single citizenship and a single international persona. Relevant United Nations resolutions and principles exist to provide the framework for a mutually acceptable solution.  We thus welcomed the recent decision by Cypriot President Dimitris Christofias and Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat to resume negotiations under the auspices of the Secretary-General. We believe that a viable solution can be achieved by the Cypriots themselves through negotiations between the two communities without artificial deadlines and arbitration. We shall continue to do everything possible to facilitate a settlement  and we hope that Turkey will also demonstrate flexibility and goodwill towards that end.  As is obvious to all of us  the United Nations is once again beset by a host of troubles that will require the patience of Job to endure and the strength of Hercules to confront. As individual States  we have no hope of marshalling the strength to contemplate  let alone battle  the dangers facing us. But together  through the United Nations  we can find the resolve not only to confront those awesome challenges but to subdue the threat that they pose for humankind. "
"69",2872,"GRD",63,2008,"I am honoured to join those who have spoken before me in congratulating the President on his election to guide the work of the sixty-third session of the General Assembly  and in commending his predecessor for his stewardship of the Assembly over the past year. I also take this opportunity to commend the Secretary-General and his staff for their continued dedication in advancing the work of the Organization.  The world has entered an era where the basis of international engagement is driven more by the trade in goods and services and the distribution of the    08-52265 44  ownership of technology than by notions of sovereignty. As a result  small vulnerable States like Grenada are being relentlessly pressed to justify their economic viability. That  along with globalization and other challenges  has negative implications for the stability of our countries. Against that backdrop  Grenada believes that its diplomacy must undergo fundamental change  not only to satisfy domestic expectations but also to enhance our chances for success.  Just over two months ago  the people of Grenada voted overwhelmingly for new leadership and a change of direction for our nation. We humbly offer our Government as an example of peace and reconciliation in action. We bring together people committed to service notwithstanding our politically turbulent historical background. In our country  we have managed to release the distrust and divisiveness that have existed for more than 30 years in order to embrace peace and reconciliation and move our country forward. We stand as an example of hope and encouragement to those who are still fighting and cannot let go of the blame  the hatred and the anger associated with the past.  We stand today as proof that peace and reconciliation are possible  that our collective hope for those world regions where brothers fight brothers and people die needlessly is not a fanciful or vain hope: it is a valid hope that can be realized. It is a hope that has materialized in our country as we move forward together  reconciled from a divisive past to serve our people and to serve our world through our participation at the United Nations. From that platform of reconciliation  we focus on and emphasize the strategic significance of partnerships in governance. Our aim is to build strong and meaningful relationships between Government  the private sector  trade unions and other groups within civil society.  Grenada believes it must play an active role in world affairs  since our own domestic agenda coincides with many aspects of the global development dialogue  particularly as it relates to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Substantial progress has been made in many of the targeted areas. Moreover  the plans and programmes presently being pursued will ensure that social and economic development does benefit all our people.  Grenada’s main strategy to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger focuses on expanding the productive sectors of the economy  particularly the agricultural sector. Emphasis will be placed on attracting young people to agriculture  stimulating the rural economy and providing for food security.   Grenada understands the importance of having a well-educated populace. We are pleased that the goal of achieving universal primary education has already been accomplished. We are now striving to ensure that each household has at least one university graduate by the year 2025.  Similarly  technical and administrative capabilities throughout the public service must be strengthened to support our developmental agenda. Grenada is convinced that we will not properly advance unless there are fundamental improvements in the development of our human resources. That is an area where international support is especially needed.  Grenada has made relatively good progress in the area of health care  especially in improving maternal health  decreasing the rate of child mortality and combating HIV/AIDS and other diseases. Our gratitude goes out to international donors and other partners associated with effective programmes in this area.  Global climate change represents a most pressing and serious challenge to the viability and the very existence of small island developing States. Climate change is not only an environmental or sustainable development issue; it is first and foremost a human issue. With the release of the fourth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  there is now scientific certainty that human activity is the main cause of global climate change. Thus  the opportunity to avoid irreversible damage to the climate system will be lost if urgent and definite actions are not immediately taken.  Small island developing States have contributed very little to the release of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Yet we are being forced to contend with the devastating effects of those emissions. We are faced with coral bleaching  sea level rise  salt water intrusion  water scarcity and increasingly severe weather events  all with very real financial and social costs for our already vulnerable economies.  The recent devastation wrought by four major hurricanes in the northern Caribbean highlights the   45 08-52265  serious problems we face as a direct result of climate change. Our solidarity goes out to the countries hardest hit  especially Cuba  Haiti  Jamaica and the Turks and Caicos islands. We call on the international community to respond appropriately to their plight.  In that regard  Grenada takes the opportunity to strongly voice its support for the Alliance of Small Island Developing States political declaration on the urgency of responding to climate change  which is slated to be adopted on Monday  29 September.  Members will appreciate why Grenada speaks passionately on this issue. We have had first-hand experience of the trauma  pain and economic loss associated with natural disasters. Four years ago  Hurricane Ivan literally destroyed our country. Thanks to the international community and  of course  to our resilient and resourceful people  we have since become more conscious of the imperatives of disaster preparedness and crisis management. As a consequence  we will continue to be at the forefront of activities to have this issue properly debated and appropriate action plans adopted and implemented. The leadership role we have played over the last several months  through the chairmanship of Alliance of Small Island States  is consistent with that mission.  Grenada welcomes Japan’s important grant-aid programme for environment and climate change under its Cool Earth Partnership initiative.  Another issue of utmost importance to Grenada is the protection of the Caribbean Sea  an issue which has been repeatedly spoken of in this forum. Indeed  Grenada and other Caribbean Member States derive tremendous economic benefits from those pristine waters  which are threatened by transhipment of nuclear waste and other hazardous materials. Grenada reiterates the call for increased attention to be given to this serious matter with a view to having our concerns adequately reflected in a stronger General Assembly resolution.  Grenada cherishes the democratic style of governance. We therefore pledge to contribute to any multilateral dialogue to promote and enhance the corresponding principles of transparency  accountability  consensus-building and respect for institutions and individual human rights. In that respect  we intend to implement  in the short term  several critical pieces of legislation  already passed by parliament  which are designed to bring about improvement in the rule of law.   Notwithstanding the atmosphere of peace and security prevailing in Grenada  our main task is to continue to enhance the daily livelihood of our people as we strive to achieve and sustain economic growth and to restore fiscal balance and debt sustainability. That challenge is compounded by unfavourable external factors including high energy costs  escalating food prices and the worrying slowdown in major world economies and financial markets.  Grenada is determined to pursue the construction of a new economy through the implementation of strategic initiatives. As we proceed with our development  we appeal to the international community for technical assistance and other forms of support. The usual role of United Nations bodies  including the Food and Agriculture Organization  the World Health Organization  UNESCO  the United Nations Development Programme and others  will be critical in the process.  No one in the developed world can deny the value of a small country like Grenada in the expansion of democracy and the fight against terrorism. Currently  environmental issues also demand urgent action on the part of all States. Those shared goals and values reshape relations between States. These issues underscore an urgent need for new platforms to address the issue of support for the developmental needs of States. Grenada believes that the realization of a global partnership for development is of urgent importance. Serious attention should be paid to addressing the special needs of the least developed countries in the areas of trade  debt relief and the environment.  It is Grenada’s hope that the sixty-third session will be filled with a spirit of camaraderie  goodwill  collaboration  equity  trust and confidence in our ability to improve the general well-being of mankind. It is our hope that the Organization’s reform will take place in such a way that the perceived dominance by some will not be a standard of inflexibility  but will give way to genuine dialogue and cooperation.  I can assure the Assembly that Grenada intends to pursue its external relations based on the principle of mutual respect. Thus  we will be an active participant in multilateral debates on current issues.  Grenada maintains its staunch and unwavering stance in the fight against terrorism  illicit drugs  weapons and human trafficking. We will continue to unconditionally support all initiatives that promote and    08-52265 46  enhance global peace and security. Grenada strongly condemns all violent acts by those who are bent on creating chaos and panic in regions around the world  and thus supports all efforts to bring the perpetrators to justice. Additionally  Grenada is committed to the full implementation of the recommendations adopted by the Caribbean Financial Action Task Force to combat money-laundering and terrorist financing.  Grenada is optimistic about the opportunities for wider and deeper engagement among Caribbean countries. We strongly believe that all countries should be allowed to develop without hindrance and undue pressure. Accordingly  Grenada calls on all countries to constructively engage Cuba at this historic juncture. Grenada is a friend both of the United States and of Cuba  and thus wishes to use this occasion to call on the former to use its diplomatic experience to assist the process of economic and social change now taking place in Cuba. Grenada contends that the stringent unilateral economic measures in place against Cuba will benefit no one and do not facilitate the world’s goal of achieving a global partnership of equals.  Additionally  Grenada calls on the United Nations to continue its vital role in assisting the African continent in realizing its development objectives. In keeping with the declaration of the recently concluded high-level meeting on Africa’s development (resolution 63/1)  we urge the Secretary-General to use his good offices to remind world leaders of their commitments for the betterment of the African people.  Similarly  the plight of Haiti  my fellow CARICOM neighbour  must be addressed with utmost compassion and urgency. Grenada recently pledged a modest monetary donation  and is proud to be a police-contributing country with the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti. In that vein  Grenada urges the other States Members of this Organization to do likewise.  Grenada urges that we capitalize on the spirit of cooperation and collaboration to assist the poor and more vulnerable nations to become and remain viable and to actively participate in a global process that needs the input of all nations of the world  big and small. In this regard  I wish to salute the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela for considerably easing some of the financial pressure inflicted on our fragile economy by the sharp increases in oil prices. Through the Petro Caribe Initiative  several Caribbean countries are able to buy oil from Venezuela on softer terms.  Grenada is convinced that the principles upon which this great organization was founded  as articulated in its Charter  should be given full vitality. That would certainly redound to our individual and collective benefit as we seek to confront the many challenges of this modern and complex era.  Grenada commends the Secretary-General for his outstanding leadership of this Organization. Finally  Grenada once again congratulates the President on his election to facilitate and direct the debate of this sixty-third session of the General Assembly. I assure him of our full support as he guides the process."
"70",2919,"GTM",63,2008,"It is an honour for me to represent my country  Guatemala  in this high international forum. It is an honour for me to represent a people who have fought for their well-being and freedom for decades  specifically the past 54 years. My Administration is an expression of precisely that desire  because  after all those years  governmental actions are now being prioritized around the human person  the concepts of solidarity and social cohesion and  especially  in the 254 days since I took office  attention to the poorest and most marginalized among our population  in particular the 23 indigenous peoples that constitute our nation.   First  I should like to commend Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann  whom we  with much Central American pride  see presiding over the General Assembly at its present session  following in the footsteps of a fellow Guatemalan  Mr. Emilio Arenales Catalán. I know that Miguel’s experience and life example will ensure the success of this session.   I also wish to thank the United Nations for assisting Guatemala in its peace process and for following up on it with the United Nations Verification Mission in Guatemala (MINUGUA) and  most recently  with the presence of the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG)  a unique mechanism that will help us combat impunity — indeed  we are the only country to have such a mechanism.   Participating in the present session of the Assembly are world leaders who will be remembered in 10 or 20 years’ time for having had the wisdom to emerge from the present crisis — a crisis regarding which  in certain areas and at certain times  there has been a marked absence of global solidarity. I join Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann in his appeal for solidarity. I believe that the great remedy for this crisis is global solidarity. We have globalized trade and information  but we have not gained the wisdom to globalize humanity or to globalize labour to ensure that migrants are not treated as criminals and that — like products  trade and money — they have freedom of movement across borders. Our migrants seek nothing more than the opportunities offered by globalization and the opening of borders. It was that very opening that worsened their poverty and encouraged them to abandon their communities.   That is why I am making a special appeal and proposal to the Secretary-General that we no longer try to resolve the problem of migration bilaterally; rather  we must do so as a bloc. For example  I should like to propose that the United Nations create a forum composed of former Presidents of countries of origin and countries receiving great numbers of migrants  such as the brotherly countries of El Salvador  Honduras  Guatemala  Colombia  Ecuador and Mexico. Together  in six months’ time  we could formulate a specific proposal to finally put an end to a situation that is a scourge for so many families  so many Guatemalans and many other nations.   I should also like to discuss the scourges of drug trafficking and organized crime  which greatly afflict our populations. Only 254 days after taking office  our Government has begun a comprehensive process of reforming the security forces. We have changed the high command of the army and the entire command of the national police so that we can fight impunity together with CICIG and the United Nations system. Thus  Guatemala can finally achieve the true  firm and lasting peace for which  with such hope  we signed an agreement here on 29 December 1996.   Everything that happens in the outside world affects us. Foreign manipulation and speculation related to oil and food affects us. As my good friend President Saca of El Salvador said earlier  our countries are accomplishing their national tasks. In 254 days  my Government has  through social cohesion  returned to the people of Guatemala what belongs to them under their Constitution: free education and health care — totally free  as stipulated in the Constitution. We have broken a paradigm. In Guatemala  it used to be forbidden to get sick after 5 p.m.  because the country’s health clinics closed at that time. Today  52 municipalities out of a total of 333 already have comprehensive health services. In addition  300 000 children now have renovated schools with teachers  desks and all the necessary equipment.   With determination  we can do what is required  but we need solidarity among everyone. We need and participate in Central American solidarity  which enables us to tell the world that the free market works.   29 08-51839  We have had a common market for 50 years  and we know that it works. But we also know that that common market requires social solidarity among ourselves.  I have always believed that solidarity is not giving what one has left over  but rather giving what someone else needs; it is very easy to give what one has left over. Giving what someone else needs requires will and solidarity. We are aware of — and have heard our colleagues’ statements about — this international crisis  but there is a much deeper crisis. The crises that the world’s leaders must face are the crisis of hunger  the crisis of discrimination and the crisis of poverty. It is the crisis of hunger that all the Governments present here today are fighting against  but that is also a global issue. We in Guatemala are a people of maize  but a few years ago they said it was bad business to plant maize and destroyed the production systems. Today  Guatemala imports maize.  I believe that now is the time for solidarity and true global security. Perhaps civil security is the easiest to achieve  despite the fact that my country is complex. Sovereignty of food  sovereignty of health  sovereignty of knowledge — these are more difficult to achieve.   We have planned to achieve solidarity  productivity  a regional spirit and governance. We have established a system of national dialogue that is enabling all the country’s social sectors to come to the negotiating table  to arrive at a true national understanding and to begin rebuilding a country that  for 54 years  was afflicted by marginalization  the cold war  hunger and bad Governments.   I am convinced that new times have come for Latin America. I am convinced that all our Latin American summits and meetings herald new times. We have our differences and individual characteristics  but Latin America has begun to look north  south and to the centre  to the Caribbean  and we see a continent with the possibility of stronger unity  of stronger horizontal South-South cooperation and North-South cooperation. Our neighbours  our dear Central America — we are peoples rooted in the region who want a strong and united Central America.  This Assembly could take a momentous turn for our future as a planet. Of course we are concerned by climate change  but we have to maintain our Mayan biosphere so that others can breathe while our communities are dying of hunger. That is solidarity. We give oxygen  but we receive technology. We give oxygen  but we receive solidarity. We give oxygen  and we receive the understanding of countries that we deserve a better fate on the basis of this international solidarity.   We have also promoted tax reform. It is no secret for many that tax reform in Guatemala meant problems and coups d’état. But now we have tax reform  with a good level of consensus. There is also commitment to transparency and to the quality of expenditures. In only 254 days 7 per cent of the national budget was directed to the poor  money that used to be and today would have been spent entirely on other things and without reference to the poor. Seven towns have begun to lower their maternal mortality indicators. Health centres are packed  because they now provide services and they are open. There are significantly more children in schools in the 45 towns that are priorities. This can be done  if there is the determination to do it.  Our security is perhaps the greatest while El Salvador  Colombia and Mexico are more successful in fighting drug trafficking. Guatemala pays the bills. That is why in this brief time I wish to thank my neighbours  Colombia  for the support that they have given us so that we can confront drug trafficking and organized crime on a regional scale. Our young people should not have to pay for the weaknesses of others. Our unassuming people and our indigenous people should not have to pay for the vices of others. I believe that if we work regionally things will go better.   I should like to acknowledge and reiterate our gratitude to the United Nations system for the peace in Guatemala that was sought during the eight years of negotiations  in which I had the honour to take part. Its follow-up with the United Nations Mission for the Verification of Human Rights and of Compliance with the Commitments of the Comprehensive Agreement on Human Rights in Guatemala (MINUGUA) and now with the presence of the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) makes it easier for us to take the difficult road towards the integration and development of Guatemala and towards equity in Guatemala.  I should like to share with members that the programmes for social cohesion that were learned and developed in Guatemala  but also acquired in friendly countries  are yielding results. The “My Family Makes Progress” programme is now affecting 40 000 families     08-51839 30  and the young people are going to school and to health facilities. The “Shopping Bag Solidarity” programme is yielding results in the urban areas  and “Open Schools” is reducing delinquency in the areas of higher risk in Guatemala City.  If we had the courage to globalize the economy we would now have the challenge  and almost the obligation  to globalize all of mankind. Such globalization would lead to comprehensive  global solidarity; it could be the way to save our planet. It could be that we save it by combining our successes and trying to avoid our errors. "
"71",2962,"GUY",63,2008,"I join with those who have spoken before me in congratulating General Assembly President d’Escoto-Brockmann on his election to guide the work of the Assembly at its sixty-third session.   As we meet this week  the global financial system is confronting its sternest test in recent memory. The current crisis is systemic in nature  historic in scale and global in reach. It comes at a time when the world economy is still wrestling with the most rapid escalation  and the highest real levels ever recorded  in the prices for fuel and food commodities. Together with the world’s belated attention to the devastating economic and social implications of climate change  those developments define the agenda before global institutions and national leaders today. They make the theme for this year’s debate both timely and necessary.  Given the gravity and urgency of the issues before us  we must be careful not to conduct this year’s debate in the customary rhetorical manner. Instead  we must resolve to translate the detailed analysis  lofty statements and good intentions for which the Assembly has become well known into concrete actions that the current circumstances demand of us  and on which history will judge us.  We must each  as countries approaching the podium to speak  be prepared to account for the pledges we have previously made. We must also be bold enough to embark on a project to achieve real change in the multilateral system. That change must be based on mandates that are relevant  institutions that are accountable and a context that is increasingly reflective of integration and interconnectedness.  Indeed  I would urge that the theme of the next General Assembly should emphasize accountability and coherence of action on the part of the developed world in matters related to aid  trade and development. Often  when taken together  the policies of those countries result in a significant net loss of welfare in the developing world and run counter to their declared intentions — for example  the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015.   23 08-51606   An episode that manifested itself merely two years ago as a moderate decline in the housing market in some parts of the United States  and that evolved into difficulties for that country’s sub-prime mortgage market  has now grown into a rapidly deepening systemic financial crisis of global proportions. Even if they are not fully integrated into the global financial system  small vulnerable economies such as Guyana will bear the full effect of those developments as demand for exports tightens  the cost of capital rises  foreign direct investment becomes scarce and tourist arrivals and migrant remittances decline. In short  economic growth and poverty reduction efforts will suffer a severe setback and the Millennium Development Goals will become even more elusive.  At the same time  crude oil prices rose by 148 per cent during the 18 months preceding July of this year. In turn  that has contributed to increasing prices for food commodities — in particular for such staples as cereals — rising in some cases by more than 200 per cent during the same period. While there have been some signs in recent weeks of those increases tapering off  and in some cases reversing marginally  the outlook clearly suggests that high prices for energy and food are here to stay.  Without a doubt  increased food prices provide an important opportunity and incentive to farmers and agricultural economies to increase production. However  they also present grave implications for access to food  in particular by the poor and  by extension  for key nutrition and health indicators among our populations.   The 2007 World Development Report shows that growth generated by agriculture can be up to four times more effective in reducing poverty than growth in other sectors. Yet the share of agriculture in official development assistance fell from 17 per cent in 1980 to just 2.9 per cent in 2006. Agriculture must therefore be given high priority in the international agenda as well as in national budgets.  It is also urgently necessary for large developed countries to re-examine ways in which current inefficient and distortionary trade policies  in particular subsidies that support inefficient domestic production and tariffs that protect against more competitive imports  can be restructured to reduce distortions in the global marketplace.  Given the impact that persistently high food prices into the future will have on the poor  the global community must commit itself to designing and funding appropriate safety nets to ensure improved access to food and the maintenance of basic nutrition.  In recent times  the Assembly has been deeply concerned about the consequences of climate change  and rightly so. But future generations demand that that concern be translated into rapid action. The climate change challenge will not slow down to meet the pace set by the United Nations. Our response must speed up to meet the pace of climate change.  The facts are straightforward. If we are to avoid catastrophic climate breakdown  we need to stabilize annual greenhouse gas emissions at about the equivalent of 2 tonnes of carbon dioxide per capita by 2050. Therefore  let the debate move on to how we make that happen  and not stagnate on a paralysing fear born from the magnitude of the problem.  There are some promising signs. The Kyoto Protocol has resulted in the emergence of a $60 billion carbon market  which is a welcome start. But although common sense dictates that those financial flows should be proportional to the problem being addressed  the bulk of that money stays within the developed world.  As a rainforest country  Guyana is particularly aware that there is virtually no capital flowing to address tropical deforestation — despite the fact that it causes 20 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions and  as analyses done by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  Nicholas Stern and others have highlighted  doing so is the most cost-effective abatement solution. That is because the Kyoto Protocol contains no significant incentives to slow the rate of tropical deforestation.  As leaders  we must set a clear direction for our negotiators as we send them to agree a post-Kyoto climate agreement  one that asserts a sense of proportionality in addressing the causes of climate change and ensures that all major mitigation options are pursued. We must also break the false debate that suggests that countries must choose between combating climate change and supporting national development. Instead  we need to forge new high-growth  low-carbon economies and make national development supportive of progress towards global emissions targets.    08-51606 24   Specifically  those of us who are leaders of rainforest countries need to understand that we provide services that are vital to the health of our planet and that  when we seek capital flows to compensate for that  we are not merely acting as passive poor countries looking for aid: we are providing a critical component of the climate solution and we should be leading the design of mechanisms as we forge a post-Kyoto climate agreement.  In Guyana  despite the fact that 85 per cent of our people live below sea level and are already suffering from changing weather patterns and rising water levels  we do not want to just complain about climate change. Instead  we want to partner with others to create a solution. As part of that  we are ready to discuss placing almost our entire rainforest in the service of the world if the right economic incentives are created and if that can be done in a way that neither trades sovereignty over our forest nor restricts the legitimate development aspirations of our people.  The African  Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries are currently negotiating an economic partnership agreement with the European Union (EU). That agreement may fundamentally affect development in our societies and jeopardize our future negotiating positions at the World Trade Organization (WTO). The European Commission has threatened to impose tariffs on our exports under the Generalized System of Preferences if we do not sign agreements that reflect the EU’s model of WTO compatibility  even though the model includes issues that have been removed from the WTO agenda — the so-called Singapore issues. Those agreements will also seriously prejudice our negotiations with other countries and may jeopardize the future of our integration movement.  The exploitation of the EU’s superior negotiating strength and the use of threats to get countries to sign are  ironically  how the EU hopes to start this partnership under the economic partnership agreement. What is particularly irksome is that we are incessantly lectured by the same group of countries to the effect that national consultations and working with civil society are essential hallmarks of good governance. Yet when the same civil society opposes the economic partnership agreement on the grounds that it is not sufficiently developmental in nature  we are told to ignore them — they are complainers. I wonder if the leaders of those countries know  or care  what is being done in their names. Even at this late hour  I wish to plead with the EU leaders to review those agreements before they irretrievably harm the good historic relations that have existed between the ACP and the EU.  That brings me to the matter of the much-needed reform of our multilateral institutions  which has been on the agenda for some time. However  it would be fair to say that it has progressed slowly and its results have been few and difficult to observe. I believe that the reforms must be pursued along certain predefined principles. First  the institutions must have new mandates that are relevant to the current circumstances  and they must have at their disposal tools to discharge those mandates effectively. Secondly  the institutions must have legitimacy and reflect an equitable representation of their membership. Thirdly  in the discharge of their functions  they must demonstrate flexibility and responsiveness. Fourthly  they must display the highest standards of accountability and transparency.   As I mentioned earlier  I believe that limitations in the mandate and functioning of the international financial institutions were a contributory factor in the current financial crisis. The mandate of the International Monetary Fund should explicitly be the preservation of systemic financial stability as a global public good. In addition  the use of passive surveillance as a general instrument and conditionality-based lending among the more vulnerable members have clearly proved to be ineffective. That is so not least because the incentives associated with conditionality-based lending are almost invariably never applicable to countries of systemic importance  and no mechanisms exist to encourage larger countries to respond to policy advice.  Likewise  the World Bank should have a revised mandate that focuses on certain key development challenges  such as protection of the environment  clean energy and certain aspects of poverty reduction  instead of trying to address every development challenge and undermining its own effectiveness. In addition  more needs to be done to democratize the institutions  to align the interests of the management and staff with those of the countries they serve and to make them more accountable to the membership.  Similarly  a more democratic and reformed United Nations Organization will be better placed to play a central role in the multilateral system in serving   25 08-51606  the interests of the international community as a whole  whether in relation to its peace and security mandates  the protection of fundamental rights or the promotion of development.  Within the Commonwealth  heads of Government have developed a set of principles and guidelines that should underpin reform of the international institutions. Among their recommendations is a call for a conference along the lines of Bretton Woods to lead the way in determining the future of the international financial institutions. I trust that those principles and guidelines will be fully embraced.  I wish this sixty-third session of the Assembly every success."
"72",3007,"HND",63,2008,"Mr. President  allow me to extend you the warmest and most heartfelt greeting of the people and the Government of Honduras. I would also extend this greeting to all nations and peoples represented here. I congratulate you  Sir  a distinguished representative of the Republic of Nicaragua who today is leading the Assembly. Your prestige as a man of peace and harmony and as a builder of dreams and utopias has been recognized throughout the world through the numerous prizes you have received  which honour the peoples of Central America.  Honduras currently holds the presidency pro tempore of the Central American Integration System  and I would like to recognize the work of the United Nations and use this opportunity also to recognize the determination of the Central American Presidents to bring about a process of Central American integration. As was recognized by the European Commission  the region of the world that is unifying the most and becoming the most integrated is Central America — after Europe  of course. That is part of an important process  because we are addressing on areas and sectors that are important for our society.  Francisco Morazán was a martyr who gave his life for the cause of Central American union and for liberal policies  opposing the enemies of independence and freedom. The peoples of Central America and of Honduras continue to fight for these causes. We continue to fight for unity as we seek to establish economic independence. In recent years  Honduras has achieved a sustainable growth rate of between 6 and 7 per cent  and we have been able to reduce poverty and have recognized the international and national importance of protecting the environment. Honduras has become a tourist destination in Central America  because of the beauty of its main Caribbean Bay Islands  such as Guanaja  Utila and Roatán.  However  today  all of those advances in our economy and in the fight against poverty are being put in jeopardy by the crisis and the international scale of the financial fraud that has been brought about by the big multinationals in the world. The serious events that today have dragged us into a food and energy crisis with high fuel prices  and the collapse of the financial systems  particularly here in the United States of    08-51839 2  America  have shown that what I and others Presidents are saying today are historic and irrefutable truths.  For example  in our countries  particularly in Honduras  poverty and inequality are continuing to grow more marked in our societies. The State continues to become weaker through privatizations and capital is concentrated in a few firms and a few hands  lessening capacity to produce and generate development for our people. In recent years  the unequal distribution of wealth and income has become ever more entrenched. In Honduras  less than 1 per cent of the population possesses 70 per cent of the national wealth. Barely 10 families with links to international capital control the main economic activities of the country  naturally impoverishing the rest of the population.  Over the last two centuries  our peoples and our region have resisted with heroism  dignity and stoicism the onslaught of the cruel system that governs us. Pope John Paul II himself came to call that capitalistic system savage  an immoral mercantile system that exploits men and women and turns them into mere commodities and numbers. The merciless and demonic laws of the invincible market only satisfy the wealth and power of the few  to the detriment of the great majority of our societies. They believe themselves infallible gods. They are like a sinister Proteus that plays cat and mouse with people. They act like Saturn  the Greek god who devoured his children out of fear that they would dethrone him. However  today  with that logic of the law of the market  his sons are devouring their creator in the very cradle of capitalism  in the great centre of Wall Street or the other hubs of speculative capital in the world.  To give an example  the international trafficking of drugs  arms and people are other scourges that prevent us developing peoples from achieving the economic freedom and independence to which our nations aspire. The submission of our poor countries to the economic choices of international capital is brutal and surprising. We can say that capitalism is devouring human beings in most parts of the world  and paradoxically it is now also devouring the very creators of that system. Here I shall mention two particularly salient examples. In Honduras  over the last 20 years  many small coffee producers have succeeded in increasing their exports from $200 million to almost $600 million. That involved 20 years of hard work. However  in the last 12 months  in barely a year  with the doubling of the prices of energy  oil  food  wheat and the main staples that we consume  we are now losing what we achieved in that period of hard work.  Another example is what has happened here to the mandate of the United Nations. In 2000  this Organization agreed that poverty should be reduced by at least 50 per cent in 15 years  which we know is not coming about. The goal of reducing poverty and the contributions that the international community pledged to the developing world are not being translated into reality. In contrast  by way of giving an example  for each dollar that the international community contributes to cooperation  it allocates 10 dollars to the arms race.  Another quite fantastic example to give today is what is happening with the bankruptcy of the big investment banks. Now people are racing to provide funds to those big banks. Logically  if we were to provide them with what is being proposed today to save those banking institutions that have created that speculative capital — a sum of $700 billion — with just a third of that amount we could reduce and immediately put an end to poverty in Africa  Asia or Latin America. That system is the true present-day King Midas  who tried to convert everything into gold and profit for one particular sector. We shall never be free under that system  and we know that we must not accept that condition of neo-slavery and neocolonialism through which  by its domination  it bends us to its purposes.  The question for us all is can that difficult situation being experienced today  particularly by the less developed countries  be saved. The answer is yes  we can save ourselves from that crisis. We can respond. First  the State must act  the State must operate again in terms of social commitment. Capital must be used so that it serves to build a genuinely fair society. The aim should not be to destroy the market but simply to construct a social market economy. Capital should exist  but with limits. Defining the limits of capitalism is important to put an end to its primitive laws of the jungle. The aim is not to eliminate entrepreneurship and the free market  but to check and regulate the abuses and to humanize and sensitize those who are in the driving seat.   We must support a genuine democratic system  not only in international bodies but also internally within our countries. We must reform false democracy  which uses different political means to legitimize that   3 08-51839  system of exploitation and injustice. It is a false democracy  in which men and women are seen merely as voters  as useful instruments employed only to distribute power  whose consciences are manipulated by the highest bidder in a political comedy in which those who possess wealth impose their mercantile irrationality on the larger group of those who are excluded from and marginalized by the system. We must reform that system  improve it and strengthen it so as to convert it into a genuine democracy. It is by the logic of political democracies that Governments are controlled and States manipulated  basic services are privatized and the whole of society is indoctrinated with an ideology of gain  egoism and individualism.  Imperialism as a system of domination of countries and of trade must disappear from the face of the Earth. The twenty-first century  and the peoples of the twenty-first century  should not have to pay for the excesses and brutality of the twentieth century.   We agree that property must exist  as it has a social function. Since the beginning of social organization in the world  property has always been granted within the framework of collective ownership. There must be the authority to intervene in speculative markets  as is happening now in the United States. Traders and their spokespeople do not have the right to direct society. The strategic areas of the economy must be at the service of the State and under its control to ensure that society never finds itself without food or medicine and that consumers are not robbed. Profits produced by work  wealth and capital should be better distributed in our societies among the real owners — workers  producers  capitalists  consumers and the State — in order to attain a common good.   The major transnational companies that produce medicines and chemical products should make available to developing countries the patents for technological discoveries that can improve living conditions for our citizens. This is a time for human solidarity.   We should end unfair competition in markets by eliminating subsidies in industrialized countries and removing tariff and non-tariff barriers. That would be a good message of the international community  a good intention at this time of crisis  for those peoples that were once their colonies  a message that we are no longer looked upon as mere game reserves but as brothers in humanity.   I am sure that the peoples of the world are able to come together to provide alternatives to a crude system that kills and destroys everything that does not adapt to its unmerciful laws.  Developed countries have a responsibility towards the peoples. Members know that very well. This afternoon we want to say  from this United Nations rostrum  that we are very grateful to the developed world  the industrialized world  for their cooperation with us at certain times. However  our peoples and our countries do not want donations. We have not come here to beg.   What we want is to be treated with equality and respect  and the right to opportunities and to participate. We do not want to be affected by the asymmetries in the economies and differences in developed countries. We do not want to have models imposed on us  models that only impoverish our nations. We do not want to be given lessons about how to manage our economies. We want to be given examples of solidarity and responsibility in the face of the major problems of nations  examples of how to distinguish between matters of importance to human beings and matters that are simply material. To developed countries we say that if they offer us aid  do not attach conditions to our acceptance of it. Do not insist that we accept a neoliberal model that is suffocating and exploiting our communities.   We cannot continue to measure development of countries by the profits of large companies. We must measure development by the access of young people to education and jobs  of children to food  of mothers to hospitals  of those who are ill to treatment  and of the undernourished to food.  We say to the countries of the Group of Eight (G8)  with all due respect  that that very important organization should expand its membership to include countries that represent the five continents  to include countries of the Americas  such as Mexico  Brazil  Bolivia or Cuba  or  from other areas  India. The G8 should increase its capacity for dialogue with  for example  Central America or the South American Common Market (MERCOSUR)  where there are so many societies that could contribute with ideas  for ideas are sometimes worth more than money.   The countries that cooperate should respect national systems and not impose their own aid reception mechanisms on us. They should respect the    08-51839 4  national priorities and systems that each country has developed in its programmes  the planning of Governments legitimately elected by the people.  Likewise  with all due respect to the European countries and to the United States of America  we wish to ask them to consider — as a gesture of goodwill and in light of the problems that we ourselves are suffering as a result of the financial imbalances that those countries caused — the rights of immigrants who are already on their territories. I would also like to recall that the peoples living in the lands of America and Europe were themselves once immigrants in those lands.  What does it cost to reunite migrant families and to begin to deal with their documentation  instead of deporting them? To immigrate is a human right  not a crime  and we should consider it in the context of respect for society. All of us want peace and harmony  and this is the best means of obtaining them.  The world is also concerned with the enlargement of the Security Council. Like other presidents who have spoken about this matter from this podium over the decades  we believe that there should be democratization at the very top of the United Nations  and the example should begin at home. That way we could discuss the real problems of humanity and find solutions.   We therefore need to establish a new pedagogy  a new way of education of our peoples  our children and future generations. We must cultivate  as is logical  genuine freedom for our nations  freedom of the press  freedom of movement  an honest freedom that gives the people the opportunity to know the truth about their problems without lies and manipulation.  The new manner of teaching that we are proposing to the General Assembly today could be promoted through the development programmes of the United Nations. We must begin to teach the value of solidarity among human beings  among countries and among the various organizations represented here. That teaching should demonstrate in a practical way that the centre of the world is not material possessions or money; the centre of the world should always be the human being — men and women  young people  children  the elderly  those beings with a soul and who are made in the image of the Creator of the universe.  In conclusion  I wish to take a moment to read a poem entitled  “Gold”  by the Honduran poet and writer Alfonso Guillén Zelaya  who described well through poetry the events we have addressed in the Assembly.  “Gold killed in men the native communion;  It divided the Earth and corrupted affection. Before that  hunger did not exist. Fruit grew in all places freely before this  Waters  hunting  the plains were free. As there were no owners  there were never thieves. Life was one of peace  of love and of gentleness. People were good  like blessings. But  Lord of the gifts  Your gifts are gone. We are now condemned to live without fortune   Everything that we have made  Our own clothing  with the gold of the stars and the silver of the moon.”  This is the Christian moral; it is the moral of the message today  tomorrow and forever  that we must accept the fact that this world is extremely materialistic and not very spiritual. It was the message offered when a tycoon approached the Master of Galilee and asked  Lord  how do I save myself? He replied: leave your possessions and follow me.   I would like to end with those thoughts on liberty  which is what our societies most need today. Let us ensure that the liberty advocated by our forefathers — Martí  Bolívar and Morazán — transforms the destiny of globalization so that we convert it into a globalization of solidarity  of justice and of harmony among the peoples. We must regain trust in the collective so that we can return to trusting in reason and say to the minority that they cannot be the reason for the State simply because of what they own. That alienating argument is unsustainable for the peoples of the world.   I fervently appeal this afternoon for us to secure votes for the freedom and peace of all peoples and nations of the Earth  for the principles expressed and ratified today in the sixty-third session of the General Assembly  because I firmly believe that a new world  another world  a better world is still possible. We have united to defend important matters of other countries. We have united to defend the positions of President Evo Morales in Bolivia so that a real social democracy can be established  as he has advocated. Based on those   5 08-51839  principles  we have signed the Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas — ALBA — and  based on those principles  we hope that the international community will also provide the international solidarity needed by Taiwan  which is asking for that solidarity.  We ask that God’s blessing for you all and for your families and your nations become a reality today  tomorrow and forevermore. "
"73",3032,"HRV",63,2008,"I would like first to congratulate Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session  as well as to thank Mr. Srgjan Kerim for the excellent work he did during his presidency of the General Assembly in the preceding year.  As we gather here once again to address the most significant issues on the global agenda  the General Assembly opening session reminds us of our shared vision of the United Nations as the embodiment of a family of nations.   It reminds us of the constant need for an effective multilateral effort to address global challenges  and to maintain and build peace in a range of conflict zones and post-conflict societies  searching for solutions within the rule-based international order  through the promotion of freedom  democracy  development and respect for human rights.  It also gives us the opportunity to take stock of our achievements  as well as to redouble our commitment to world peace and progress.  This is a commitment that Croatia and its people accepted even before our independence: a commitment to strengthen international cooperation through effective multilateral organizations for advancing peace and security  facilitating development and combating poverty  protecting our environment  eradicating diseases and promoting public health.  As a renewal of that commitment  we celebrate this year the 120th anniversary of the birth of the famous Croat  Dr. Andrija Štampar  a founding father of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the first President of the WHO Assembly. In his inaugural speech in 1948  Dr. Štampar clearly stated that the   11 08-52265  Organization should become a pioneer of world peace and promote understanding among nations.  Dr. Štampar’s words are also true for the broader family of United Nations institutions. His words are a testimony to the lasting commitment of Croatia and its people to the promotion of peace through international cooperation.  Since our independence  Croatia’s leaders have come every year before this Assembly to renew this solemn commitment. Even in the most difficult of times  when our own existence was in peril and collective security guarantees vanished  we still came to New York to express Croatia’s adherence to the values enshrined in the Charter.  Croatia has come a long way since those testing days of struggle. Yet our determination in pursuing the Charter principles has remained intact.  We have developed a stable democracy and a growing economy  but we have not forgotten those brave men and women who struggled for and achieved our independence  as well as those men and women of goodwill who  under the flag of the United Nations  assisted us in our time of need.  With that conviction and determination  with that sincere sense of gratitude and a genuine vocation for cooperation  I come today before the Assembly to share with it Croatia’s views on the most pressing and relevant issues for our international community.  On this occasion  though  Croatia is for the first time in a position to address these issues from a different angle — that of an elected member of the Security Council. Membership of the Security Council is not only a great honour for Croatia  but also a great responsibility we have been preparing for in recent years. (spoke in French)   Over the past decade  Croatia has completed a transformative journey that may without exaggeration be described as impressive. Since the war-torn early 1990s it has emerged as an anchor of stability  security and cooperation in South-East Europe.   Croatia is today at the doorstep of the European Union. We are determined to conclude the accession negotiations in 2009  thus completing a demanding process of profound political  economic and social reforms.  Our European vocation has guided us in the testing period of our transition  and it will continue to guide us once Croatia becomes a full member of the European Union. (spoke in English)  We attach equal importance to our membership of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)  and we look forward to the celebration of our accession to the alliance at the next summit in spring 2009  which will also mark NATO’s sixtieth anniversary.  Through reforms  we have successfully turned our country from a consumer to a net contributor to international peace and security. Today  Croatian forces are engaged in 13 United Nations peacekeeping operations in four different continents. Our men and women in uniform also serve in the NATO-led operation in Afghanistan and the European Union operation in Chad  in accordance with the relevant Security Council resolutions.  In all these conflict areas  our service men and women have proved their dedication and professionalism. However  probably their most valuable contribution is their ability to share with the local population Croatia’s own experience in overcoming the consequences of war and taking the road of reconciliation  cooperation and development.  As a member of the Security Council  Croatia will continue to work as a responsible and dedicated partner in the common effort to maintain and build peace through the promotion of human rights and democracy  the fight for the eradication of poverty and injustice  and the advancement of effective multilateralism.  In this Croatia will be guided by a sense of responsibility  solidarity and good faith. We hold that effective multilateral action  including with regional organizations  is our best guarantee in safeguarding these values.  While we see progress in advancing these values in some troubled areas of our world  such as Afghanistan  Iraq and the Middle East  we have also witnessed other conflicts arising  such as in Georgia.  In this respect  we welcome the six-point agreement brokered by the European Union presidency and President Sarkozy in August  as well as the implementing agreement from September.    08-52265 12   We are also aware that the failure to address these issues in a multilateral context of cooperation could lead us into old paradigms of confrontation. At the same time  the lack of audacity to confront them could endanger the democratic gains obtained with the end of the cold war. These gains should be preserved  as they themselves derive from the fundamental principles emanating from the Charter.  We should not forget that the United Nations stands for the common fundamental values of freedom  equality  solidarity  tolerance and respect for human rights. In this regard  the suffering of the people of the Sudan  particularly in Darfur  and the suffering of the people in Somalia and Myanmar are also stark reminders of the gap between the goals this Organization has set and the realities on the ground.  My country welcomes joint international efforts to address the question of flagrant violations of international humanitarian law and human rights through established international mechanisms and institutions like the International Criminal Court (ICC). The ICC provides a vital recourse to justice in situations where national Governments cannot or will not address these issues themselves.  Human rights and the rule of law are essential building blocks for a more peaceful  just and prosperous world. This year we are marking the sixtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. As a member of the Security Council  my country is dedicated to advancing these rights to those most vulnerable in conflict: civilians  notably women and children.  We are pleased that this year the Council adopted a strong and action-oriented resolution addressing the disturbing practice of sexual violence as a method of warfare.   We also continue to work on advancing the cause of preventing children becoming part of armed conflicts  believing that the realities on the ground require stronger Council involvement. For this and many other reasons  Croatia has decided to present its candidature for membership in the Human Rights Council for the period 2010-2013.  We live in a world that has significantly redefined the traditional notion of threats to international peace and security. In an increasingly interconnected world  global threats are taking many forms.  Terrorism  poverty  disease  climate change  environmental degradation and rising food prices command that we work together  as only a common vision and collective action  implemented in the spirit of solidarity and responsibility  can counter these challenges.  Terrorism attempts to undermine the core values of the modern world and poses a serious challenge to our security  the basic principles of democratic societies and the rights and freedoms of our citizens. Terrorist acts are criminal in nature and cannot be justified under any circumstances. Croatia appreciates and fully supports all efforts in the global struggle against terrorism  within the United Nations system and beyond.  Since the beginning of this year  my country has been chairing the Security Council Counter-Terrorism Committee  which was established in the immediate aftermath of the devastating terrorist attacks against the United States and the whole democratic world on 11 September 2001. We have assumed this responsibility with the utmost seriousness and are working towards moving the Committee forward by focusing on concrete results and achieving realistic objectives.  I would also like to reiterate the importance Croatia attaches to the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy as one of the primary international documents in the global fight against terrorism. Croatia is also active on the regional level  presiding over the Committee of Experts on Terrorism (CODEXTER) within the Council of Europe.  In overcoming global threats and challenges  initiatives such as the Alliance of Civilizations can also act as a stimulus  augmenting mutual respect  understanding and cooperation among States and peoples across cultures and religions. As the Alliance’s main goal is to counter intolerance  religious fundamentalism and extremism  Croatia is pleased to be a part of this ever-growing group.  Our dialogue and cooperation should also be directed with more emphasis at combating poverty and establishing a global partnership for development. In this regard  my country welcomes the Secretary-General’s leadership in calling for action to make progress for the poorest of the poor  the so-called bottom billion.   13 08-52265   We also believe that it is essential for Governments to support the delivery of commitments made  with the aim of getting the Millennium Development Goals back on track. Specific arrangements between donor and recipient countries on the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals should be put into action through a human-centred approach to the key themes of the Goals  or more precisely health and education  the environment and the eradication of poverty.  In this sense  we recognize the importance of mobilizing financial resources for development  as well as their effective use in developing countries. The Monterrey Consensus remains the foundation of the global partnership for development  and Croatia believes in a positive outcome of the review conference to take place in Doha later this year. In this context  Croatia will honour the obligations and figures established pursuant to its status as a candidate for membership in the European Union.  Through its transition process Croatia has emerged from being a recipient country to being a country whose own experience and resources have enabled it to become an international donor. As a contributor to various United Nations funds and programmes  Croatia has confirmed its capability to support the activities of the United Nations in numerous fields  and will continue to do so through sharing our experiences and assisting those in need.  However  while Croatia increases its contribution to global progress and takes a more assertive role in the international arena  it also remains active in  and committed to  fostering stability in South-East Europe. Our membership in the Security Council and our advanced phase of integration in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the European Union has not led us to turn our back on our neighbours. On the contrary  it has enabled us to redouble our efforts in preserving stability and maximizing the benefits of peace.  Through initiatives such as the establishment of the Regional Cooperation Council (RCC)  headquartered in Sarajevo and with a top Croatian diplomat  Mr. Hido Biscevic  as its first Secretary General  we have actively contributed to regional stability.  However  there is still unfinished business in our neighbouring region. Let me mention one example: Bosnia and Herzegovina. The foundations for stability in that country reside in respect for equal rights for all three constituent and sovereign people: Croats  Bosniaks and Serbs.  The Republic of Croatia stands ready  along with the international community  to support and assist Bosnia and Herzegovina  as well as all the other countries in the region  through an active policy of cooperation.  Such cooperation paves the way for long-standing security and prosperity in South-East Europe. And in that way Croatia will continue to back the Euro-Atlantic aspirations of all its neighbours. In that way my country will renew its determination to foster peace  democracy and tolerance  thus honouring our commitment to the Charter.  Last April  in this very Hall  His Holiness Pope Benedict XVI reminded us that:  “The founding principles of the Organization — the desire for peace  the quest for justice  respect for the dignity of the person  humanitarian cooperation and assistance — express the just aspirations of the human spirit and constitute the ideals which should underpin international relations.” (A/62/PV.95  p. 3)  We should always remember these ideals as we continue to work together on exploiting the full potential of the United Nations in creating a more peaceful  prosperous and democratic world."
"74",3077,"HTI",63,2008,"Just one year ago (see A/62/PV.6)  I recalled before this Assembly that I was bringing the words of a people who for 200 years have experienced extreme suffering as a result of all kinds of material privation and complete vulnerability in the face of natural risks and disasters.  At that time  I hardly thought that I would find myself here again one year later against the backdrop of the image of hundreds of children  women and the elderly swept away by floodwaters  hundreds of thousands of citizens suddenly finding themselves without shelter  tens of thousands of tons of agricultural harvest destroyed in a few hours  not to mention the incalculable damage to basic infrastructure such as communication networks  art works  irrigation systems  the electricity grid  the water system and other structures.   I am pointing out that those catastrophic events occurred just four months after the first angry demonstrations of the population against the explosion in food prices  reactions that would be repeated on an almost global scale  as though to express a collective cry of the poor regarding what was happening beyond just a global food crisis  as the rejection of an order for which the poor had too long been the only ones to pay the cost.  The damage caused four consecutive hurricanes in less than two months has set Haiti back several years. Those hurricanes sorely test our capacity to resist  particularly when it must be borne in mind that all those victims  and their families  and all those businesses  large or small  have to fend for themselves while they wait for the State  and the State alone  to help them to get back on their feet or return to business. There are no adequate market insurance systems to compensate for the losses arising from that enormous damage.   I cannot thank the Secretary-General enough for the great outpouring of sympathy that the United Nations system has shown towards the people of Haiti following those disasters. I can hardly express sufficient thanks for the mobilization organized by the United Nations agencies on the ground to bring help to the most vulnerable and assist the affected families to tackle the most urgent problems.  How can I thank the many friendly countries that so quickly mobilized their own resources and logistics    08-52272 4  to come to the aid of the Haitians? How can we express our gratitude in the light of those expressions of compassion and the numerous initiatives of solidarity coming from civil society and the private sector in those same friendly countries?  Just as dark clouds have a silver lining  how could I not recall that huge solidarity movement from within even our country  involving civil society and non-governmental organizations  not to forget  of course  the millions of Haitians living abroad  in an unprecedented mobilization  all striving to work together in synergy with the local authorities and specialized agencies of the central Government.  Despite the suffering that the Haitian people are enduring today because of the cumulative effect of the disasters that befell them  I cannot help turning my thoughts to our neighbours  countries such as Cuba  the Dominican Republic  Mexico  our brother nations in the Caribbean Community and even some States on the southern coast of the United States that have also suffered considerable damage as a result of those first hurricanes of the season — and I stress  the first hurricanes of the season. How can we not remember either the sight of the disasters that have struck India  Bangladesh and other regions of the Asian continent?   However  beyond those calamities that we could  quite easily  attribute to nature  how can we ignore other disasters for which we humans are directly responsible through war and the destruction that we bring about with such determination in various areas of the world? To all citizens of those countries affected by the violence of men and by natural disasters  to their families and their representatives here at this Assembly  on behalf of the Haitian people I address my best wishes for courage in their reconstruction efforts and in their quest for peace and happiness. And I can assure them of our feeling of solidarity and fraternity in that effort.  While I salute that huge wave of generosity towards my country and am grateful for that solidarity  recognizing it was necessary for the immediate needs of those affected  I cannot fail to draw attention to the concerns that it raises for Haitians. I am worried because I know how deep-rooted our problems are. I am concerned because I am apprehensive about the time when that solidarity  exhausted in the first wave of humanitarian compassion  will leave us  as always  alone — really alone — in the face of new disasters  to see as if in a ritual  the same mobilization exercises.  I am concerned because the Haitians risk finding themselves alone in ensuring the only real task that needs undertaking today: that of rebuilding the country. We must rebuild its production capacity and social fabric and give our young people a new dream  the poor new hope  and our citizens of all political leanings and all social strata new confidence. We need a reconstruction project thought out in a systematic approach and able to count on genuine solidarity to mobilize the necessary resources for its implementation.  That is why we are sceptical with regard to imported food aid and the traditional way in which it is carried out. We have to break this paradigm of charity in our approach to international cooperation  for charity has never helped any country to emerge from underdevelopment.  The Native Americans that lived in our country and the Africans that replaced them helped a large part of humanity to amass its current wealth. We are simple workers who have been moulded by hard labour and blessed with a keen sense for commerce and creating businesses.   If the international community wants to do something useful with Haitians  that would be to help us use our potential. The liberalization of trade can be beneficial to humanity  particularly to the poor  who have the ability to produce for a greater market. But this liberalization must be done without hypocrisy or duping anyone. It must be carried out on the basis of clear  transparent rules that are the same for everyone  and the powers that promote them must begin by respecting those rules themselves.  Setting up and maintaining genuine productive capacities and trading under fair conditions are the initial conditions that would enable poor people to escape from the chains of poverty. The day when development aid aligns itself with these criteria  the fight against poverty and hunger will really turn a corner in this world of ours.  We will then see that the poor are not as poor as all that. We will see that they have available to them assets that political parties  institutions and cooperation programmes are not sufficiently making use of. We all realize that the lands and the unregistered houses the   5 08-52272  poor possess and the informal businesses they are involved in are also capital that can legitimately circulate in the economy and participate in the creation of new wealth.  This system simply has to be formalized. And we have to give property title to those who own those lands and those houses. We also have to formalize this trade. I have begun discussions with some of our partners to move quickly to a thorough evaluation of new needs created by the damage to our infrastructure with a view to developing a comprehensive reconstruction plan  which will serve as the conductor for cooperation efforts with our country.   Last Tuesday  on the occasion of the opening of the general debate of the sixty-third session of the General Assembly (5th meeting)  I listened very carefully to the opening statement of the President. The creation of the United Nations was an important conquest in the history of mankind’s struggle to find a remedy for poverty and to build a world of peace based on equality and respect for everyone’s rights. The Organization remains the privileged place for debating the problems of our world and for allowing the voices of the poor and of those left behind to be heard. We cannot allow its work to be hindered by its inability to take into account the voice of the majority. We cannot allow its agencies to exist only for themselves  relegating to second place their primary mission of service.  I agree with the President that our Organization needs profound reform so that it becomes more effective  more transparent and genuinely democratic. If it fails to accomplish this  the United Nations risks being resented by the small and derided by the big. We do not need that in these difficult and uncertain days  when our planet is being put to a severe test by a combination of crises of all kinds  multidimensional crises whose solution will depend on our collective capacity to deal with them effectively  equitably and with solidarity.  The announced high-level dialogue on the democratization of the United Nations  if approached with courage and determination  will put us on the road to changing its structures and its way of functioning. Such reforms can only be a source of inspiration and a model for small countries  stricken like us by long-standing difficulties  for ending institutional fragility and arriving at political stability and a fully functioning rule of law.   This Assembly is among those to whom fate has entrusted the destiny of our planet. The world that is being remoulded around us is a world in which wealth and poverty can no longer be confined within closed spaces  separated by impassable borders. Climate change has no borders. Viruses and diseases are elusive undocumented visitors. The hunger of the poor is a threat and will continue to threaten the happiness of the rich.  The question that we have to collectively ask ourselves today is this: will we perish together because we were not able to take up our mission together with courage  or will we agree to mobilize for a new plan for humanity under a new form of governance  one that is responsible and based on solidarity  in order to save our beautiful planet  and to give our children the opportunity to build a better world? "
"75",3123,"HUN",63,2008,"At the outset  allow me to congratulate you  Mr. President  on your election. In fulfilling your challenging tasks during this session  you may rest assured of the support and cooperation of the delegation of the Republic of Hungary. I also wish to salute your predecessor  Mr. Srgjan Kerim  representative of the Eastern European Group  who served us with distinction and dedication.  The challenges we have to face daily in an increasingly globalized world require answers based on the principle of universally accepted values and the practice of flexible adaptation to swift changes in our environment. That need is reflected in the new external relations strategy adopted by the Hungarian Government at the beginning of this year. Our strategy  policies and actions demonstrate our commitment to upholding the rule of international law  to giving priority to effective multilateralism  to spreading the culture of cooperation and the peaceful settlement of international disputes  and to working towards preserving a liveable and sustainable environment for future generations. Hungary’s geographic position and its expertise in democracy building  good governance  promoting the rule of law and human rights  disarmament and non-proliferation will serve as a good basis for our effective contribution to the work of the Organization.  Skyrocketing energy prices  food and financial crises and commodity speculation are endangering the results we have attained so far towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). A coherent and coordinated response is needed to reverse that process. As an emerging donor country  Hungary firmly believes that the international community cannot use the difficulties we all face as an excuse not to do the utmost to achieve the MDGs.    08-53129 8   We are firmly dedicated to broadening the outreach of our foreign policy to the developing countries of Africa  Asia  Latin America and the Caribbean. International development cooperation and assistance are a growing segment of our foreign policy. We are strongly committed to intensifying our efforts in the years to come. We are therefore gradually increasing our official development assistance  concentrating primarily on those activities where Hungary has comparative advantages  especially in the areas of agriculture to combat famine and poverty through the introduction of modern growing facilities  animal husbandry technologies  forestry and fisheries programmes  water management  developing health services and promoting good governance.  Every day we are ruining our environment through the intensive pace of development and the emission of greenhouse gases. To address that challenge  we need a more effective institutional framework that includes clear political guidance; adequate  stable and predictable funding; a strong scientific base; and improved assessment of activities and emergency response institutions. Hungary fully agrees that the matter is urgent and hopes that the ongoing deliberations on the future of the United Nations Framework Climate Change Convention and the Kyoto Protocol will lead to concrete results in the coming year.  This year we mark the sixtieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  as well as 15 years of the existence of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. Over the past 60 years  humankind has made extraordinary progress in the promotion and protection of human rights. Our job is to work hard for the full implementation of human rights treaties. Our expectations were fulfilled on 3 May of this year when the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities entered into force. Hungary became the second Member State to ratify the Convention and its Optional Protocol. We hope that it will be universally accepted in the near future.   We strongly supported the establishment of the Human Rights Council and we are determined to continue to do so. In our view  the time has come for the Council  as well as for all of us  to redouble our dedicated efforts to make the work of the Human Rights Council more efficient.   Following the adoption of a consensus resolution by the Council last September  the Forum on Minority Issues will hold its first session at the end of 2008. I am personally very proud that the first Forum session will be chaired by a fellow Hungarian  Ms. Viktória Mohácsi  a member of the European Parliament. I hope that  under her guidance  the Forum on Minority Issues will be widely recognized  efficient and results-oriented.  We firmly believe that a lasting solution to current challenges cannot be achieved without the effective involvement of women in all aspects of international cooperation. I would like to state that Hungary fully supports the initiative to undertake a comprehensive review of the implementation of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) by 2010  and I am confident that the United Nations should play a leadership role.   The United Nations and the European Union — together with Governments  non-governmental organizations and other international organizations around the world — have made tremendous efforts to promote international cooperation in the area of the prevention of genocide and mass atrocities. However  the steps taken thus far still fall short of preventing the many dreadful crimes against humanity. As a Member of the United Nations and the European Union  Hungary is fully committed to the idea of preventing genocide and is ready to take specific steps to that end. We have decided to prepare a feasibility study on the establishment in Budapest of an international centre for the prevention of genocide and mass atrocities. In our view  it should be an independent institution with the aim of contributing to international efforts to prevent the occurrence of genocide.  The most important outstanding issue in the area of counter-terrorism  is the full and speedy implementation of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy (see resolution 60/288)  for which Member States have the main responsibility. Concluding a comprehensive convention on international terrorism also remains a high priority for the Republic of Hungary  and we fully support the work of the Ad Hoc Committee in that regard. We hope that we will be able to finalize the drafting of a comprehensive convention on international terrorism during the sixty-third session.   9 08-53129   In spite of the many security and political challenges that still persist in Afghanistan  we acknowledge and appreciate the achievements of the international community and the enormous work that has been done so far to bring about tangible improvements in the everyday lives of the Afghan people. In that process  the United Nations Mission in Afghanistan remains instrumental  especially in the preparation and conduct of the upcoming presidential and parliamentary elections in 2009 and 2010. Hungary remains committed to helping Afghanistan to rebuild following many years of war and to create a State that is safe  stable and democratic. We are committed to continuing our military assistance as a leading nation in the Provincial Reconstruction Team in the northern part of the country  as well as to expand our development activities in Afghanistan.  Contributing to peace and stability and achieving prosperity have constituted a cornerstone of Hungarian foreign policy in the Western Balkans for many years. We continue to believe that that goal is best served by actively supporting the integration of the region into Euro-Atlantic structures. As we all know  on 17 February  Kosovo declared its independence. A number of United Nations Member States recognized that independence  including Hungary. We deem it of crucial importance that a resolution of the Kosovo Assembly and its new constitution fully committed Kosovo to democracy  the rule of law  the protection of Serb communities and other minorities  the protection of cultural and religious heritage and the international presence. Without a stable Kosovo there can be no stability in the Balkans. In that context  we welcome and support the continued presence of the international community on the basis of Security Council resolution 1244 (1999). We also remain committed to contributing to the stability of Kosovo through the European Union Rule of Law Mission  the International Security Force in Kosovo and an international civilian office as part of the international presence.  Hungary fully supports the efforts of the international community and various institutions to implement the peace agreement in Georgia. Hungary strongly believes in the peaceful settlement of conflicts. The use of military force to settle territorial disputes represents a dangerous precedent that can have further implications in the whole region and beyond. Any further steps and negotiations must be based on full respect for Georgia’s sovereignty  territorial integrity  internationally recognized borders and democratically elected leadership. It is of crucial importance that all parties agree on a unified interpretation of the agreement. We fully support  and we are ready to participate in  the planned missions of the different international institutions  such as those of the EU and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe  in resolving the conflict and monitoring the implementation of the peace agreement. Hungary has offered humanitarian assistance  and we are studying further possibilities to assist Georgia.  Hungary attaches great importance to the comprehensive process initiated at the Annapolis Conference  convened by the President of the United States of America  in order to settle the Middle East conflict. Since Annapolis  there have been regular meetings between Israel and the Palestinian National Authority. We hope that the peace process will lead to the resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the normalization of Israeli-Arab relations.  The Iranian nuclear programme continues to be a matter of serious concern for my Government. Iran has failed to provide the international community with credible assurances as to whether its nuclear projects are in line with its international obligations. We deeply regret that the leadership of Iran has refused to abide with the relevant Security Council resolutions. Only full and unconditional compliance with the demand to suspend its enrichment-related and reprocessing activities can pave the way for the re-establishment of confidence in the peaceful nature of the Iranian nuclear programme and open up prospects for intensified economic and political cooperation. We hope that Iran will change its present course of confrontation and opt for constructive dialogue with its partners.  After five years of conflict  Iraq is showing clear signs of recovery for the first time. With the help of the international community  Iraq is achieving major milestones in the reconciliation and reconstruction process. Hungary welcomes the fact that the improved security situation allows for the establishment of a withdrawal schedule  assuming that a fundamental change in the capability of the Iraqi Government to take control provides grounds for a long-term settlement of the crisis.  Due to the conflict raging in Darfur  which is one of the most worrisome on the African continent  the situation in the Sudan and neighbouring countries is    08-53129 10  still unpredictable and explosive. Hungary welcomes the extension of the mandate of African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur until 31 July 2009. It is essential that the mission be fully deployed by the end of the year. The establishment of criminal courts in the region paves the way towards a solution of the crisis in Darfur. Nevertheless  we should continue to follow the fragile peace process closely.  We are convinced that  in order to address the various challenges of the twenty-first century  the international community needs a strong  reformed and well-functioning United Nations. Progress has been made in all areas of United Nations reform in the past two years  with some new bodies becoming operational. In other areas we need further consultations and negotiations with Member States in order to achieve a lasting solution. Hungary is ready to contribute to those negotiations. We welcome the recent decision of the General Assembly to start the intergovernmental negotiations on the reform of the Security Council during the sixty-third session.  In conclusion  Hungary is strongly committed to work with you  Mr. President  during the sixty-third session of the General Assembly in attaining the objectives of the United Nations. "
"76",3170,"IDN",63,2008,"May I first congratulate Mr. D’Escoto Brockmann on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session. I am sure that he will lead our deliberations with great wisdom and skill. I also wish to congratulate his predecessor  Mr. Srgjan Kerim  for ably guiding our sixty-second session.  It is timely and wise that we focus our deliberations on the global food crisis and on the democratization of the United Nations. While those two issues appear to be vastly different  they have more to do with each other than meets the eye. For democracy means nothing if a part of humankind is well fed while a larger part of it goes to bed hungry every night. Human equality is a mirage in any country where a part of the population struggles against obesity while a larger part of it wonders where the next meal is coming from.  I do not exaggerate. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations  food prices will remain high for the next three to five years. Rice stocks are falling to their lowest level since the mid-1970s. Wheat stocks are sinking to their lowest since 1948. Compounding the situation is the explosive growth of the world population.  There is a huge unfilled demand for food. Food riots have already erupted in parts of the Middle East  Africa  Asia and the Caribbean. In 33 countries  especially those with fragile States  there is a real and present danger of social and political unrest because people are hungry. We must vigorously address the problem of global food insecurity. Otherwise  peace is at risk in the developing world and in pockets of poverty in the developed world. What the world needs today is a new Green Revolution — a Green Revolution that this time embraces the entire developing world  especially Africa. Developing countries must now put agriculture  especially food production  back into the core of their development agenda. For their part  the developed countries must put agriculture and food production into the core of their trade and aid programmes.  In that regard  the experience of Indonesia may be instructive. It is not easy to feed a population of 230 million  the fourth largest in the world  but there are no food riots in Indonesia. Last year  we had a surplus production of rice. We used that surplus to bolster our national stockpile. That has contributed to national stability. This year  we expect another surplus of 5 per cent  which brings production to 36 million tons. We are going to export part of that as our contribution to global food security.  We can do that because we have vastly improved our rice productivity by providing our farmers with microfinancing  improved seed varieties  cheap but appropriate farm technology and affordable fertilizers. We have thus developed some experience and expertise that worked for us and can work in other developing countries. We will continue to share those in the spirit of South-South cooperation.  Food security is a cause in which everyone must be involved. In that light  I firmly believe that this General Assembly of ours is called upon to take a number of concrete measures.   First  we can task the World Bank and the relevant United Nations bodies to develop ways and means of helping national Governments to spend more on agriculture and on rural infrastructures to empower small farmers.  Secondly  let us ensure that the appropriate United Nations bodies link up with regional mechanisms for food security  such as common food reserves and early warning systems on regional food    08-53129 16  crises. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations has such an arrangement and so do other regional arrangements. The United Nations can serve as the hub  while the regional arrangements serve as the spokes of a global wheel for food security.  Thirdly  let us establish the framework for a global partnership on food security. We should ensure that the World Trade Organization Doha development negotiations reach a conclusion that supports increased food production. Let us make use of the forthcoming review of the Monterrey Consensus on financing for development as an opportunity to devise ways to fund the Green Revolution.  Let us be mindful  however  that agriculture does not always lead to a food harvest. It is even possible that an imprudent rush to produce biofuels will lead to a severe reduction of the food supply. It is true that by switching from fossil fuels to biofuels  we can cushion the impact of the skyrocketing of the world price of oil and thereby address the energy crisis. It is also true that  by making that switch in fuels  we reduce greenhouse gas emissions and thereby address the challenge of climate change.   It would be unwise and reckless  however  to address two crises by aggravating a third. We cannot allay the energy crisis and the crisis of global warming by deepening the global food crisis. That will only worsen the plight of humankind  but we can carry out a broad range of rational and coordinated policies and initiatives that address those crises systemically. We can address the energy crisis by developing all alternative sources of available energy  which will help mitigate global warming.  Moreover  in the next 16 months we can advance the climate change agenda through the Bali Road Map  all the way from Bali to Copenhagen through Poznan. Indonesia is fully committed to that process. After hosting the Bali conference that produced the Road Map  we have joined the troika of host countries to give the process a push among world leaders. By 2009  we should produce an ambitious post-2012 global climate regime that will contain global warming to within two degrees Celsius in the next 20 years. But even before the process is concluded in Copenhagen  we in Indonesia are partnering with other countries to enhance our topical forests and coral reefs in an effort to reduce carbon emissions.  Even as we face the challenge of global warming in the physical world  we must also deal with the reality of a global chill in the politico-security field. Symptoms of that chill are the military tensions that have arisen in Eastern Europe.  There is also a new arms race. There is more military spending now than there was at the end of the cold war. Moreover  the conflicts and tensions of a year ago are still with us. The dream of establishing a Palestinian State by the end of this year has virtually crumbled. The Iraqi and Afghan conflicts keep raging on. North Korea  the subject of so much uncertainty today  is backsliding from its commitment to dismantle its nuclear weapons programme. The nuclear issue in Iran remains unresolved.   In the face of those conflicts and tensions  the Security Council should have been more decisive. That the Council has failed to resolve them is a cause for concern. Of the issues that the Council has failed to resolve  two are of great concern to Indonesia  namely  those recent cases that directly infringe on the principle of the territorial integrity and political independence of States  both involving external intervention that led to the secession of a part or parts of a State. Both cases involved major Powers.  It is of the greatest importance to Indonesia and  I believe  to many developing countries that those recent cases do not set an ill-advised and dangerous precedent. Developing countries in the midst of nation-building and State-building would be extremely vulnerable to such precedents. The danger is that it takes only one misstep to kill principles that have been enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations  such as the principle of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States. If we kill those principles  we have killed the ideal that holds the United Nations together.  The sovereignty of States must be preserved if there is to be a democratic spirit in international relations. That idea is essential because  without democracy  a world organization like the United Nations cannot be effective. Indeed  the failure of the Security Council to come to grips with recent challenges to global security is due largely to the fact that it is not democratic enough.  To make the Council more democratic  the use of the veto power of the permanent five must be regulated. The misuse of the veto by any one permanent member should no longer be allowed to   17 08-53129  paralyse the entire Council. Democratization of the Council also means an equitable distribution of its membership  not only in terms of geographical representation  where we already have imbalances  but also in terms of constituencies. Hence  the world’s major civilizations should be proportionately represented. The world’s community of 1.1 billion Muslims must be represented on the Council if it is to be truly democratic.  The need for democratization is also deeply felt at the regional level. In the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)  I am pleased to say  we have responded to that need. The cause of democracy is gaining ground in the region as we transform ASEAN from a loose association into a true community that is firmly committed to the promotion of democracy and human rights. All members  without exception  strongly share that commitment.  It is in that spirit that Indonesia is launching the Bali Democracy Forum this December. It will be not an exclusive forum among democracies  but an inclusive and open forum for the countries of Asia to share their experiences and best practices in fostering democracy. A true democracy is always homegrown; it is never anything that is imposed from outside.  Meanwhile  we in Indonesia continue to tend to our young democracy. We are seeing to it that democracy takes root  not only by holding free elections  but also by working hard to provide good governance  to sustain a system of checks and balances among the three branches of Government  and to strengthen the roles of the mass media and civil society in our national life. Thus we pursue the democratic ideal: democracy at the level of the United Nations  democracy at the regional level and democracy within the nation.  At each of those levels  we hope to see nations and people taking control of their lives and taking part in the decision-making processes that shape their future. The realization of that ideal will give full meaning to the first three words of the Charter of the United Nations. Indeed  “We the peoples” is what democracy is all about. "
"77",3217,"IND",63,2008,"May I first congratulate you  Sir  on your election as President of the Assembly at its sixty-third session. I am sure that your wisdom and vast experience will guide us as we deliberate the many challenges that the world faces today.  The United Nations is the embodiment of our faith in the benefits of collective action and of multilateral approaches in resolving global issues. At the 2005 World Summit we pledged ourselves to an agenda for early and meaningful reform of the United Nations. However  we must acknowledge frankly that there has been little progress on the core elements of the reform agenda.  We need to make more determined efforts to revitalize the General Assembly to enable it to fulfil its rightful role as the principal deliberative organ of the United Nations system. The composition of the Security Council needs to change to reflect contemporary realities of the twenty-first century. Only a truly representative and revitalized United Nations can become the effective focal point for the cooperative efforts of the world community. We need to expeditiously hold negotiations towards this end.  Globalization has contributed to ever-widening circles of prosperity  and we in India have also benefited from it. But its benefits have not been equitably distributed. Ensuring inclusive growth within nations  and inclusive globalization across nations  is a central challenge facing us all.  The development gains that many countries have made are today threatened by a possible food crisis  a global energy crisis and  most recently  unprecedented upheavals in international financial markets.  The net impact of these problems is that both the industrialized economies and the developing economies face inflation and a slowdown in growth after several years of robust expansion. Industrialized countries can afford periods of slow growth. Developing countries cannot. There is therefore an urgent need for coordinated action by the global community on several fronts.  The explosion of financial innovation unaccompanied by credible systemic regulation has made the financial system vulnerable. The resulting crisis of confidence threatens global prosperity in the increasingly interdependent world in which we all live. There is  therefore  a need for a new international initiative to bring structural reform in the world’s financial system  with more effective regulation and   9 08-52265  stronger systems of multilateral consultations and surveillance. This must be designed in as inclusive a manner as possible.  The world food crisis is the cumulative consequence of the neglect of agriculture in the developing world  exacerbated by distortionary agricultural subsidies in the developed world. Diversion of cultivable land for producing biofuels is compounding the problem.  The world needs a second green revolution to address the problem of food security. We need new technologies  new institutional responses and above all a global compact to ensure food and livelihood security. This will require transfer of technology and innovation from developed to developing countries. India is very keen to expand cooperation with Africa in Africa’s quest for food and livelihood security for its people.  Trade liberalization in agriculture can help  provided it adequately takes into account the livelihood concerns of poor and vulnerable farmers in the developing and least developed countries.  It is feared that many of the conflicts of the twenty-first century will be over water. We must therefore reflect on how to use this scarce resource most efficiently. We need to invest in new technologies and new production regimes for rain-fed and dryland agriculture and explore cost-effective desalination technologies.  Poverty  ignorance and disease still afflict millions and millions of people. The commitment to achieve the ambitious targets set as part of the Millennium Development Goals was an acknowledgement by the international community that global prosperity and welfare are indivisible and that affluence cannot coexist with pervasive poverty.  Unfortunately  solemn commitments made for the transfer of financial resources from the developed to the developing world have remained largely unfulfilled. The commitment of developed countries to move to the target set long ago of 0.7 per cent of gross national income as official development assistance needs to be honoured as a matter of priority. In this context  special efforts have to be made to address the concerns of Africa for adequate resource flows to support its development.  Poverty alleviation and livelihood security are closely linked to energy security. We need a much greater measure of predictability and stability in the oil and gas markets. We need to think of ways and means  such as early warning mechanisms  to help countries cope with oil shocks.  We must put in place a global cooperative network of institutions of developed and developing countries engaged in research and development in energy efficiency  clean energy technologies  and renewable sources of energy.  India is registering rapid economic growth  and has combined it with declining energy intensity of its economy. However  our total demand will keep increasing  and we are actively looking for all possible sources of clean energy.  The opening of international civil nuclear cooperation with India will have a positive impact on global energy security and on the efforts to combat climate change. This is a vindication of India’s impeccable record on non-proliferation and testifies to our long-standing commitment to nuclear disarmament that is global  universal and non-discriminatory in nature. The blueprint for this was spelled out by Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in this very Assembly 20 years ago.  I reiterate India’s proposal for a nuclear weapons convention prohibiting the development  production  stockpiling and use of nuclear weapons and providing for their complete elimination within a specified time frame.  Climate change can be overcome successfully only through a collaborative and cooperative global effort.  We support the multilateral negotiations now taking place under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The outcome must be fair and equitable and recognize the principle that each citizen of the world has equal entitlement to the global atmospheric space.  I believe that the pursuit of ecologically sustainable development need not be in contradiction to achieving our growth objectives. As Mahatma Gandhi once said  “The earth has enough resources to meet people’s needs  but will never have enough to satisfy people’s greed.”     08-52265 10   India has unveiled an ambitious national action plan on climate change. Even as we pursue economic growth  we are committed to our per capita emissions of greenhouse gases not exceeding those of the developed countries.  The growing assertion of separate identities and ethnic  cultural and religious intolerance threaten our developmental efforts and our peace and stability. It is vital that we strengthen international cooperation to combat terrorism and to bring the perpetrators  organizers  financers and sponsors of terrorism to justice. We should conclude expeditiously the draft comprehensive convention on international terrorism.  In this context  the situation in Afghanistan is a matter of deep concern. The international community must pool all its resources to ensure the success of Afghanistan’s reconstruction efforts and its emergence as a moderate  pluralistic and democratic society.  We welcome the return of democracy in Pakistan. We are committed to resolving all outstanding issues between India and Pakistan  including the issue of Jammu and Kashmir  through peaceful dialogue.  We also welcome the coming to power of democratically elected Governments in Nepal and Bhutan. We seek to expand areas of cooperation with all these countries to deal with the challenges of sustainable development and poverty eradication.  The United Nations is a living symbol of pluralism. It has weathered many storms. It is the vehicle through which our combined will and efforts to address global challenges must be articulated and implemented. Unless we rise to the task  we will bequeath to succeeding generations a world of diminishing prospects. "
"78",3263,"IRL",63,2008,"Mr. President  let me begin by warmly congratulating you on your election. You have my very best wishes for a successful term in office.  This is my first opportunity to address the General Assembly as Ireland’s Foreign Minister. It is a great honour and privilege to do so. Ireland believes strongly in the purposes  principles and potential of the United Nations. Formed in the shadow of global war  the United Nations embodies the idea of our common humanity. We have a shared interest as well as a moral obligation to act on that common humanity in the world.  In this new century  when we speak of the international community  it cannot be as a vague platitude or as a faceless scapegoat. Global challenges confront us: climate change  economic turbulence  food and energy crises  HIV/AIDS and terrorism  among others. We can either be an international community passively divided and at the mercy of those forces  or we can be a community  in the true sense  of active participants united by our sense of mutual solidarity  our common sense of justice  our common desire for a better and peaceful future and a shared commitment to international law and the human rights of all.  The United Nations is the indispensable framework for realizing the potential of that community  as it has shown again and again. Ireland is proud to have played its distinctive part in that history and we are absolutely committed to playing a full part in its future. And let us be clear — the challenges we face have intensified in the past year.  Over the past period  we have witnessed the potential fallout from the financial crisis for all countries and not least  of course  for developing countries. The depth of their concerns has been heard from this rostrum. We have all failed as yet to reach agreement on a balanced world trade deal. Rising fuel and food prices have exacted a particular toll on the world’s most vulnerable and poor. The effects of climate change  likewise  are placing a disproportionate burden on those least equipped to cope. More than halfway towards the 2015 target date for the Millennium Development Goals and despite significant progress in some areas  we have not made enough headway towards meeting them. The United Nations must continue to take the lead in those efforts  while each of us as political leaders must recognize our duty to take effective action in support of goals that are only increasing in relevance and urgency.  The world needs a strong and effective United Nations  and that is why  as a committed Member State  Ireland has long supported efforts to reform and    08-53141 2  improve its operation. I very much welcome and appreciate the priority that Secretary-General Ban has attached to that task. As he said when he took up office  “the true measure of success of the United Nations is not how much we promise  but how much we deliver for those who need us most” (A/61/PV.31  p. 9). Every Member State must play its part in ensuring that it can fulfil its role. Ireland is therefore proud of the contribution it has made to the reform process.  Most recently  we were pleased to work closely with our good friend and colleague  Tanzania  in facilitating consultations on greater system-wide coherence in the United Nations  a vitally important part of the reform agenda. I would like to take the opportunity to express my deep appreciation of the constructive spirit in which Member States and United Nations agencies and staff approached the consultation process  chaired by Ambassadors Kavanagh and Mahiga. Their report was welcomed in the consensus resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 15 September. A lot  of course  remains to be done. We should not shy away from issues just because they are difficult to tackle.  Taking forward the reform agenda does not  of course  mean losing sight of the real strengths and achievements of the United Nations  especially in peacekeeping. This year marks the fiftieth anniversary of the first occasion on which personnel of the Irish Defence Forces wore the blue beret. In the five decades since  they have worn it with pride and distinction. I would like to take this opportunity to offer them and those with whom they have served my deepest personal gratitude.  Of course  as the world continues to evolve  so will our approach to peacekeeping. Regional organizations  such as the European Union  can and should be expected to play an increasingly prominent role in undertaking Security Council-mandated operations. I am particularly pleased that one such mission  the EU military operation in the Republic of Chad  is under the very effective leadership of an Irishman  Lieutenant General Pat Nash.  Last year  my predecessor expressed the hope that  after almost 40 years  it would no longer be necessary for Irish ministers to brief this Assembly on the search for peace on the island of Ireland. I am pleased to confirm that the task we now confront in Ireland is no longer building peace  but securing and underpinning it for the generations to come. Our history has  however  made us particularly conscious of the huge human cost of conflict and the moral obligation we carry to prevent and to resolve it. We in Ireland owe a debt of gratitude to all in the international community who lent their support to our search for peace. In that search  we were genuinely part of a community — concentric circles of other nations and international actors that provided goodwill and momentum  moral support  concrete assistance  independent mediation and facilitation when needed. Anchoring the process was a central partnership between the British and Irish Governments. So we know the good that can be done and we now feel a special duty to try and repay some of that debt in kind.  That is why my Government has established a conflict resolution unit within my ministry as a channel through which we can make our contribution. Its aim is to complement the work of others  especially that of the United Nations. It will  in part  draw on the lessons we have learned from our own experiences. As part of that work  Nuala O’Loan  formerly the Police Ombudsman in Northern Ireland  who played a significant personal role in building confidence in the new policing arrangements there  is now serving as our Special Envoy to Timor-Leste.  Ireland’s commitment to peacekeeping  peacebuilding and conflict resolution extends to removing not only the causes of conflict  but also the means. Creating a secure and stable world demands effective arms control and disarmament and the elimination of nuclear weapons. Ireland was very proud last May to host the diplomatic conference that delivered the Convention on Cluster Munitions  an historic agreement to ban the production and use of those pernicious instruments of war. The Convention is strong and ambitious. Each State party undertakes never  in any circumstances  to use  develop  produce  acquire  stockpile  retain or transfer cluster munitions  or to assist any other party in doing so. It is comprehensive and it provides for no exceptions. It sets new standards for assistance to victims and also  importantly  for clearing affected areas. I would once again like to express the deep appreciation of my Government for the constructive approach taken by Member States. Without it  such a significant step forward could not have been taken. The Convention will open for signature in Oslo in December  and   3 08-53141  Ireland will be among the first signatories. I strongly urge all Governments to do likewise.  Peace and security must be accompanied by a firm commitment to the protection and promotion of human rights. That remains at the very core of the United Nations mandate. In this  the sixtieth anniversary year of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  we must act with renewed determination to make its promises a living reality for all of our people. That means improving the United Nations capacity to tackle abuses effectively whenever and wherever they arise  ensuring a strong and vigilant Human Rights Council.  This is also the tenth anniversary of the adoption of the Rome Statute establishing the International Criminal Court (ICC). It has already carved out a vital role for itself in bringing an end to impunity and in demanding that the rule of law be upheld. Ireland remains strongly supportive of the ICC and its mandate  and urges all Member States to cooperate fully with its work.  Eradicating world hunger and ending poverty is one of the most urgent tasks we face. Realizing the vision of the Millennium Development Goals is a great challenge  but it can be met. I am very proud that Ireland is now the sixth largest aid donor in the world in terms of gross national product percentage. It is  I believe  a reflection of our values of solidarity and respect for human dignity. As a committed member State  I am also gratified that the European Union and its member States continue to be the world’s leading donor  accounting for some 60 per cent of the world’s official development assistance.  In support of our efforts to secure the Millennium Development Goals  Ireland established a hunger task force to determine the most effective contribution we can make to tackling the root causes of hunger  particularly in Africa. Comprising 15 renowned international experts  its report was launched by our Prime Minister  Taoiseach Brian Cowen  last week with the participation of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. The report has highlighted three particular areas for focus. First  we need to improve small-holder productivity in Africa; the agricultural sector has been neglected for too long. Secondly  we need increased focus on maternal and infant undernutrition; a bad start makes life an uphill struggle from day one. Thirdly  the report states clearly that we do not need new commitments  but rather delivery on the ones we have already entered into. Those important messages will guide our work in the period ahead.  Let me turn now to the situation in the Middle East. The first Irish peacekeepers 50 years ago were deployed to serve with the United Nations mission in Lebanon. It is therefore a particular source of sadness to me that  despite the great efforts that have been made down the years  we do not yet have lasting peace in the Middle East  especially between the Palestinian people and Israel.  I commend the efforts of all of those who are prepared to take the political risks necessary to turn that situation around. In particular  I welcome and support the dialogue that President Abbas and Prime Minister Olmert have engaged in under the auspices of the Annapolis process. I hope that what they have achieved together in their talks can be built upon in the immediate period ahead  and that it will result in what we all wish to see — a just agreement  a lasting peace and a more prosperous future for their people.  Improving conditions on the ground in the Palestinian territories  including  very importantly  the economic and social situation  would  I believe  make a significant and critical contribution to creating the right context for talks to succeed. In that regard  I have called many times for an end to the construction of illegal settlements not only because it is right to do so  but also because it would send a strong and welcome signal of good faith at a difficult and uncertain time. Israel needs urgently to listen to the voice — the concerned voice — of the international community on the settlement issue.  The situation in the Sudan and the tragic suffering of the people of Darfur urgently demand our attention. I strongly urge the Sudanese Government and the rebel groups to return to the negotiating table and to engage seriously with Chief Mediator Bassolé. The African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur must be allowed to deploy fully and speedily  and a secure environment must be created to allow the humanitarian community to carry out its important work. A culture of impunity cannot prevail. Those responsible for human rights abuses in Darfur must be brought to justice. The Government in Khartoum must face up to its responsibilities to protect its citizens  to provide security and to ensure justice is done.    08-53141 4   In Zimbabwe  the recent agreement to form a power-sharing Government is a moment of opportunity that must be seized. The people of Zimbabwe  who have suffered for far too long  deserve a new beginning and look to their leaders to provide it. Their leaders must not be found wanting. I look forward to the delivery of genuine power-sharing  of real political and economic reform and of the creation of a more open and free society.  In Burma  we continue to stand with the people in their demand for greater democracy and human rights  and we renew in particular our call for the immediate release of Aung San Suu Kyi and her fellow political prisoners. It is gravely disappointing that the ruling military junta has not engaged seriously with the good offices mission of the Secretary-General  or responded in any meaningful way to the concerns of the international community. International pressure must be maintained on Burma’s leaders  including  and in particular  by the countries of the region.  Ireland has watched with great distress the recent conflict in Georgia  including the evidence of the use of cluster munitions against civilian populations. We warmly applaud President Sarkozy and the French presidency of the European Union for their efforts to secure a settlement. The European Union is deploying a monitoring mission to Georgia to work alongside United Nations observers  to which Ireland is proud to be contributing. We now need to see the full honouring of commitments entered into  including the full withdrawal of military forces by early October. I also urge Russia and Georgia to engage constructively and in good faith in the discussions scheduled to begin in Geneva on 15 October.  In closing  I would like to return to where I began today. As Ireland’s Foreign Minister  I come here to reaffirm our strong attachment and loyalty to the United Nations. Whether we wish it or not  we are being united every day more and more by the common challenges we all face. The principles and the work of the United Nations have never been needed more. Its principles give us a firm foundation. Continuing reform will give us even stronger tools. What remains to be proven is our collective will to use them.  The vision shared by all our peoples of a peaceful and secure world  with justice  human rights and dignity for all  can be realized only in cooperation with others of like mind. For Ireland’s part  we are determined not to be a passive member of that formal community of nations.  With the support and the help of others  the foundations of a future of peace have  as I have reported  been laid on the island of Ireland. We are now determined to honour that debt and continue a long tradition of active engagement in the world by contributing our energy and our initiative where we can make a difference. It is only through such a commitment by each of us and through this body that we can make the international community more than the sum of its parts  more than the sum of its fears  and instead make it what it was meant to be when the United Nations was established — the sum of all our hopes.

"79",3310,"IRN",63,2008,"I am grateful to the Almighty for granting me another opportunity to be present at this world Assembly. In the past three years  I have talked to the Assembly about great hopes in the bright future of human society and about some solutions for achieving sustainable peace and expanding love  compassion and cooperation. I have also talked about unjust systems governing the world; pressures exerted by some Powers seeking to trample the rights of other nations; oppression imposed on the majority of the global community  especially on the peoples of Iraq  Palestine  Lebanon  Africa  Latin America and Asia; about challenges we are faced with  such as efforts to shatter the sanctity of families  destroy cultures  humiliate lofty values  neglect commitments and expand the shadow of threats; as well as about the arms race and the unfairness and inability of the systems governing world affairs to reform the status quo.   9 08-51606   With the emergence of various new developments  the debility of existing mechanisms has been revealed even more starkly. However  at the same time an encouraging trend  originating in the thoughts and beliefs of peoples  has blossomed and become stronger. Against the backdrop of the despair caused by the new developments  that trend has ignited a glimmer of hope in the hearts of men for a brilliant  desirable and beautiful future.  Today  I would like to talk to the Assembly about the main reasons behind the conditions ruling the world and the means to address them. Of course  the Assembly is already aware of what I am talking about  but I think it is necessary to remind ourselves. It seems that the roots of problems lie in the way one views and perceives the world and humankind  as well as in the important issues of freedom  obeisance to God  and justice. The world  humankind  freedom  obeisance to God  and justice have been of the utmost importance to humans throughout history.  God Almighty purposefully created the world. The world is the bedrock for the evolution and growth of a creature called man  and the laws governing the world and all other creatures are at the service of humankind’s quest for loftiness. The world should provide the needed opportunities for the fulfilment of the purpose behind humankind’s creation. No phenomenon  creature or  indeed  anything has been created in vain. Together they all pave the way for the flourishing of humankind in a complex and purposeful system  and they are each one of the signs of God Almighty. All are His creations and He is the sole creator and ruler of the world. All existence  including power  knowledge and wealth  comes from Him.  With regard to humankind  God created the world for humans  and humans for Himself. He created humans from mud and in the soil  but He did not want them to remain in the soil or with animal instincts. He kindled the light of guidance in their souls and asked them to rise from the soil to the heavens and to Him with the help of wisdom  prophets and perfect men.  The world will ultimately disappear  but God has created humankind for eternity and has made it a manifestation of Himself. Creativity  mercifulness  kindness  knowledge  wisdom  zeal  compassion  splendor  justice  bounteousness  generosity  greatness  love  glory  dignity  forgiveness  insight  kingship and all other goodness and beauty are attributes of God. God did not create humans for aggression  bloodshed  rancour  selfishness and destruction. He made humans His vicegerents on Earth and has asked them  on the one hand  to make Earth prosper by using their God-given potentials  to prepare the ground for the growth of divine attributes in all humans and to provide all with a life full of beauty  amity  freedom  justice and goodness; and  on the other hand  in pursuance of that path  to prepare for a prosperous  everlasting life endowed by God’s mercy. God has obligated humans to live divinely and socially  for it is only through social life and interactions with others that divine attributes can emerge.  With regard to obeisance to God  God Almighty has tied the perfection and true freedom of humans to the devotion and obedience to Himself. True freedom and obedience to God are in balance  and in fact are two sides of the same coin. Obeisance to God means confessing to monotheism  obeying His commands  and being free from ungodly worship. Obeisance to God means the acceptance of the absolute truth  the absolute light and the absolute beauty. Obeisance to God means abandoning selfishness  animal instincts  power-seeking and aggression and surrendering to righteousness  justice  love and perfection.   In that way  humans can achieve their true freedom and flourish. They can grow and manifest divine attributes  have affection for others  stand up for justice  fear no power or threat and defend the oppressed. In such an environment  one’s freedom will not impinge on any others’. Contention and conflict are characteristic of materialistic freedom and animal instinct. The essence of all divine religions and obeisance to God and true freedom is disassociating from oppressors and instead obeying and worshiping God.  God is omniscient and knows all that is revealed or kept secret  and He is kind and merciful. All creatures are humble before Him and resign themselves to His will. God is alive and is the Creator of the universe and all life. God loves His creatures and desires nothing but goodness  blessings and perfection for them  and is against bullying  injustice  selfishness and domination.  With regard to justice  it is the foundation of the creation of humankind and the whole universe. Justice is tantamount to placing every phenomenon in its own place and providing humans with opportunities to    08-51606 10  actualize all their divine capabilities. Without it  the order of the universe will collapse and the opportunity for perfection will fade away. Without justice  it would be impossible for human society to taste real peace  beauty  joy and happiness. Justice is the main pillar of social life  and without it social life cannot continue or grow.  Humans need to know God in order to realize a prosperous society in this world as well as to strive for a beautiful eternal life. To that end  they first have to know themselves and strive for loftiness in themselves and their societies. However  as long as the world is construed as closed  limited and aimless; as long as eternal life is considered imaginary and illusory  while the afterlife and the judgment day  as well as reward and punishment  are thought of as fictional and unreal; as long as morals and commitment to them are called backwardness  while immorality  lies  deceit and selfishness are considered desirable and humans are limited to a materialistic life in this world; as long as attempts are made to replace obedience to God and following His prophets and true freedom with servitude to materialistic tendencies  animal instincts and the oppression of others  while contention reaches its pinnacle; as long as the aggressors  because of their financial  political and propaganda powers  not only escape punishment but even claim righteousness; and as long as wars are started and nations enslaved in order to win votes in elections  not only will the problems of the global community remain unsolved  but they will be increasingly exacerbated.  Let us look at the situation in the world today.   Iraq was attacked under the false pretext of uncovering weapons of mass destruction and overthrowing a dictator. The dictator was toppled and weapons of mass destruction were not uncovered. A democratic government is established by the votes of the people  but after six years the occupiers are still there. They insist on imposing colonial agreements on the people of Iraq by keeping them under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter. Millions of people have been killed or displaced  and the occupiers  with no sense of shame  are still seeking to solidify their position in the political geography of the region and to dominate oil resources. They have no respect for the people of Iraq and they disregard any dignity  rights or status for them. The United Nations is not capable enough to solve the problems and to stop aggression  occupation and imposition.   In Palestine  60 years of carnage and invasion is still continuing at the hands of some criminal and occupying Zionists. They have forged a regime by collecting people from various parts of the world and bringing them to another people’s land by displacing  detaining and killing the true owners of that land. With advance notice  they invade  assassinate and maintain food and medicine blockades  while some hegemonic and bullying Powers support them. The Security Council cannot do anything and sometimes  under pressure from a few bullying Powers  even paves the way for supporting those Zionist murderers. It is natural that some United Nations resolutions that have addressed the plight of the Palestinian people have been relegated to the archives unnoticed.  In Afghanistan  the production of narcotics has multiplied since the presence of NATO forces began. Domestic conflicts continue  terrorism is spreading and innocent people are bombarded on a daily basis in streets  markets  and schools and at wedding ceremonies. The people of Afghanistan are the victims of the willingness of NATO member States to dominate the regions surrounding India  China and South Asia. The Security Council cannot do anything about it because some of those NATO members also happen to be the major decision-makers in the Council.  In Africa  there are efforts to re-establish the relationships of the colonial era. By starting civil wars in large countries  including the Sudan  the disintegration of those countries is planned in order to serve the interests of some corrupt Powers. When there is national resistance  the leaders of the resistance are put under pressure by legal mechanisms created by the very same Powers.  In Latin America  people find their security  national interests and cultures seriously endangered by the menacing shadow of alien domineering Governments  and even by the embassies of some empires.   The lives  property and rights of the people of Georgia  Ossetia and Abkhazia are victims of the tendencies and provocation of NATO and certain Western Powers and the underhanded actions of the Zionists.  The never-ending arms race  the proliferation and stockpiling of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction  and the threats to use them and the   11 08-51606  establishment of missile defence systems have made the situation unstable.  With regard to Iran’s peaceful nuclear programme  despite the inalienable right of all nations  including the Iranian nation  to produce nuclear fuel for peaceful purposes  and despite such facts as the transparency of all Iranian activities and our country’s full cooperation with the inspectors of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the Agency’s repeated confirmation of the fact that Iran’s activities are peaceful  a few bullying Powers have sought to put hurdles in the way of the peaceful nuclear activities of the Iranian nation by exerting political and economic pressure on Iran and threatening and pressuring IAEA. Those are the same Powers that produce new generations of lethal nuclear arms and possess stockpiles of nuclear weapons that no international organization is monitoring. Moreover  the tragedies of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were perpetrated by one of them.  Indeed  they are not against weapons  but they oppose the progress of other nations  and tend to monopolize technologies and to use those monopolies to impose their will on other nations. However  it is very natural that the great Iranian people  with their trust in God  with determination and steadfastness and with the support of their friends  will resist the bullying and have defended and will continue to defend their rights. The Iranian nation is for dialogue  but it has not accepted and will not accept illegal demands. The time has come for IAEA to present a clear report to the international community on its monitoring of the disarmament of those nuclear Powers and their nuclear activities  and for a disarmament committee to be established by independent States to monitor the disarmament of those nuclear Powers.  Theories of development that are in line with the hegemonic system and not in accordance with the true needs of humankind and human societies have become repetitive and bland tools for assimilating economies  expanding hegemonic domination and destroying the environment and the social solidarity of nations. There is no end in sight to this. Poverty  hunger and deprivation are hurting more than one billion of the world’s population and have dashed their hopes for a decent life.  The dignity  integrity and rights of the American and European people are being played with by a small but deceitful number of people called Zionists. Although they are a miniscule minority  they have been dominating an important portion of the financial and monetary centres  as well as the political decision-making centres of some European countries and the United States  in a deceitful  complex and furtive manner. It is deeply disastrous to witness that some presidential or premier nominees in some big countries have to visit those people  take part in their gatherings and swear their allegiances and commitment to their interests in order to attain financial or media support.  That means that the great people of America and various nations of Europe need to obey the demands and wishes of a small number of acquisitive and invasive people. Those nations are spending their dignity and resources on the crimes  occupation and threats of the Zionist network against their will.  All that is due to the manner in which the immoral and the powerful view the world  humankind  freedom  obeisance to God and justice. The thoughts and deeds of those who think they are superior to others and consider others to be second class and inferior  who intend to remain out of the divine circle and to be the absolute slaves of their materialistic and selfish desires  who intend to expand their aggressive and domineering natures  constitute the roots of the problems in societies today. They are the hindrances to the realization of material and spiritual prosperity and to security  peace and brotherhood among nations.   I explicitly state that the Iranian people and the overwhelming majority of peoples and Governments are against those deeds and perspectives of the world-domineering Powers. The establishment of justice requires people who have achieved moderation and justice inside themselves  restrained their domineering attitudes and actualized their attributes of self-sacrifice and are at the service of humankind. The complete and full-scale manifestation of such characteristics can happen only under the rule of the righteous and perfect human being who is obedient to God and who is promised by the divine prophets.  Of course  with the grace of God Almighty  a hopeful trend is flourishing in the heart and soul of human societies. The universal eagerness for justice  purity  love for others  monotheism and the quest for perfection is clearly and increasingly on the rise. A universal resistance to the acquisitiveness  aggression and selfishness of the bullying Powers is being formed.    08-51606 12  Today  the bullying Powers’ thoughts  practices and strategies are rejected by nations and Governments  and all are seeking to establish new human relations based on justice  with a view to attaining prosperity  perfection  security and sustainable welfare. That is the very auspicious phenomenon that all the traditions of creation and the ruling laws of the universe emphasize and support.  Today  the Zionist regime is on a definite slope to collapse  and there is no way for it to get out of the cesspool it and its supporters have created. The Islamic Republic of Iran  while fully respecting the resistance of the oppressed people of Palestine and expressing its all-out support for it  submits to the Secretary-General of the United Nations its humane solution  based on a free referendum in Palestine to determine and establish the type of State in the entire Palestinian lands.  The American empire in the world is reaching the end of its road  and its next rulers must limit their interference to their own borders. Today  the thought of hegemony quickly becomes a demerit.  I should now like to say a few words to expansionist Governments ruling global relations. Be aware that living with obedience to God and carrying out His orders  having compassion for people and striving for the fulfilment of justice is to your advantage too. I invite you to return to the path of God  the prophets and the people of the world  as well as to truth and justice. The only route to salvation is a divine straight path. Otherwise  God’s hand of power will emerge from the sleeve of oppressed nations and will make your life difficult  and will put an end to your hegemony. Let us love the peoples of the world and respect their rights. Rectify past behaviour. That will benefit you and the human community. The Iranian people are prepared  along with other nations  to help you be rescued from your current situation and to establish peace and prosperity.  Fortuitously  opportunities are accessible. With the grace of God Almighty  the existing pillars of the oppressive system are crumbling. Great developments in favour of humankind  as well as its true and real rights  are on the way. A golden and brilliant future is awaiting humankind. A global community filled with justice  friendship  brotherhood and welfare is at hand  as I have elaborated — a community that will tread the path of beauty and love under the rule of the righteous and perfect human being  the one promised by all divine prophets and the one who is the true lover of humankind; a community that will be devoid of all fear  despair and privation. Such a community will soon be ours. The community promised by the great divine prophets Noah  Abraham  Moses  Jesus Christ and Muhammad is about to materialize.  Let us  hand in hand  expand the thought of resistance to evil and the minority of those who are ill-wishers. Let us support goodness and the majority of people who are good and the embodiment of absolute good that is the Imam of Time  the Promised One who will come accompanied by Jesus Christ  and accordingly design and implement just and humanistic mechanisms for regulating the constructive relationships between nations and Governments.  May the great Almighty deliver the saviour of nations and put an end to the sufferings of humankind and bring forth justice  beauty and love. Let us have a proper share in the establishment of that illuminated and promised divine age. "
"80",3357,"IRQ",63,2008,"Allow me to extend my congratulations to Mr. D’Escoto Brockmann on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session. I wish him success in his great work responsibilities and projects. I hope he will be able to work for the interests of States Members of the United Nations. I would like also to thank his predecessor  Mr. Srgjan Kerim  for presiding over the last session of the General Assembly.  It is with honour and pleasure at this major international gathering that I convey greetings from the Government of the Republic of Iraq and its people. Iraq’s former regime left behind security and political conditions that had become a drain on the energy of the Iraqi people and that led to a deterioration of the country’s economy. Those conditions also left behind significant environmental and social damage. The foreign policy of the former regime and its domestic practices dragged the country into futile wars  leaving behind millions of victims and the destruction of economic and state institutions.  While the Iraqi people are building a new federal State on the basis of democracy  pluralism and the peaceful distribution of power  they have been subject to and affected by a series of terrorist acts targeting all Iraqis  be they Sunni or Shia Arabs  Kurds  Turkmen or Chaldo-Assyrians  and attempts to ignite sectarian strife  undermine the political process and stability of the country  and return Iraq to the days of tyranny  backwardness  oppression and dictatorship.   27 08-51845   Terrorism is a blind danger that threatens everyone. At a time when the Iraqi people call upon the representatives of their elected national Government to combat the remnants of terrorism  they call upon the international community  and in particular neighbouring countries  to support Iraq in its efforts to suppress violence and terrorism and to promote peace  security and stability. That would have a positive impact on the stability and security of the region and on the interests of its peoples and of the international community as a whole.  The acts of terrorism committed by the enemies of freedom will not discourage our people from creating a new democratic experience. Our people have paid a heavy price for embracing that experience. Our position requires the support and assistance of countries around the world if we are to build a modern nation that ensures justice  equality  strengthened the rule of law  respect for human rights and participation by women in all spheres of life.  The Iraqi Government continues to impose the rule of law throughout Iraq with determination  disarming militias and armed gangs  fighting sectarian conflict and building State institutions on the basis of national unity.  The initiative for reconciliation and national dialogue launched by the Iraqi Government among the various stakeholders in Iraq — be they Muslim  non-Muslim  Arab  Kurd  Turkmen  Chaldo-Assyrian  Shiite or Sunni — draws its strength from the heritage of the Iraqi people  which has rendered great services to humanity. Iraqis have coexisted in a spirit of fraternity  love and tolerance since the dawn of history. Their religious  sectarian and national diversity has been a driving force in promoting national unity. National reconciliation is a shared responsibility between political forces  decision makers  religious scholars  intellectuals  civil society organizations and all active actors in Iraq.  Progress has been achieved on the ground thanks to ongoing national reconciliation activities that have brought about the end of sectarian killings and an improvement in the security situation  along with the return of thousands of displaced families to their homes  the launch of construction projects and the provision of services to citizens.  The proper preparation and continuous training given to security and military forces have greatly impacted their efficiency and capacity to respond to criminal gangs  militias and terrorist organizations. Those forces conducted successful security campaigns to enforce the law in Baghdad and thereby eliminated most of the armed militias and gangs and terrorist groups  which greatly helped us to restore security and stability. We also undertook similar and successful campaigns in Basra  Mosul  Diyala and other provinces.   The Iraqi security forces have taken over security duties from the multinational forces in many of Iraq’s provinces  most recently in Anbar. We are currently assuming full responsibility for defending and preserving the democratic achievements of our people. The Government is aware that those efforts have not fully attained our objectives and aspirations and that there is still much work ahead of us before we achieve the stable and prosperous Iraq to which we all aspire. Therefore  we call upon the international community to support and assist Iraq in achieving those noble goals. We are determined to assume responsibility for all security tasks by the end of this year.  The national unity Government has sought to improve Iraq’s relations with other countries throughout the world  in particular our neighbours  in accordance with the principles set out in the new Iraqi Constitution. It calls for the establishment of good relations with neighbouring countries that share our interests  on the basis of non-interference in their internal affairs  diplomacy  direct dialogue and the peaceful settlement of disputes. Therefore  Iraq is no longer a threat to international peace and security. We call on the international community to ensure that Iraq is no longer subjected to action under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations  putting an end to all Security Council measures against Iraq  including with regard to compensation.   We thank our neighbouring countries for participating in three large regional conferences  the most recent of which was held in Kuwait in April 2008. We also thank them for their continued cooperation and coordination to support the efforts of the Government and the people of Iraq to restore peace  stability and prosperity  by promoting ongoing dialogue in the areas of national reconciliation  combating terrorism  strengthening the rule of law and increasing political participation. Those conferences have given participants the opportunity to reaffirm their commitments to Iraq’s territorial integrity  unity  full    08-51845 28  sovereignty and independence and to non-interference in its internal affairs  as well as their pledges to honour those commitments. We are currently preparing for a forthcoming meeting among Iraq’s neighbours to be held in Baghdad  at which we will be able to set forth guiding principles for future positive cooperative efforts in the political  economical and security fields.  Thanks to Iraq’s new policies  our country has become a meeting place for dialogue for regional and international adversaries. We would like to enhance that positive role and to adopt a policy that will help to further reduce tensions and wars not only in the region but also in the world at large. This year  senior Iraqi officials made important high-level visits to neighbouring countries and other nations. Iraq was also visited by senior officials from the region  and their consultations promoted balanced and stable political and economic policies that increased the Arab diplomatic presence in Iraq. Therefore  we call on all nations — especially given the great improvement in our security situation — to open or reopen diplomatic missions and to enhance existing ones by increasing the level of their representation.   Furthermore  in its foreign policy  Iraq has made it a priority to enhance its role in the international community through effective participation in meetings and conferences held by United Nations agencies and funds on various international issues. Iraq has also acceded to many United Nations conventions and treaties  including the Chemical Weapons Convention  the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty  the Kyoto Protocol and protocols and conventions related to the fight against terrorism.   Given the nearly 50 per cent increase in the Iraqi budget compared with last year  and in view of our future aspirations and the improvements owing to increased revenues derived from our natural resources — including our fertile agricultural lands and abundant water  mineral  and human resources — we signed the International Compact with Iraq  aimed at achieving economic prosperity and social justice in partnership with the international community. That document represents a new stage in the establishment of balanced relations between Iraq and the other nations of the world. The First Annual Review Conference of the International Compact  held in Stockholm in May 2008  saw a high level of international participation. Its outcomes included a proposal to establish a new international development partnership that would include a joint financing mechanism for new programmes with international partners in Iraq  as well as an effort to identify critical areas for cooperation on issues such as human development  human rights  reconstruction and economic governance  as points for departure in developing new patterns of international cooperation and assistance with regard to Iraq.   The Government of Iraq would like to thank the international community for assisting us in our efforts to address our crises and challenges. We would also like to thank the countries that have cancelled Iraqi debt and to thank the Secretary-General Secretary for his good efforts to that end.   The Government of Iraq is eager to cooperate with the United Nations and would like to reactivate the Organization’s work in our country so that the international community can strengthen its efforts to rebuild Iraq and to support national reconciliation and our democratic experience. We thus call on the United Nations to enhance its presence in Iraq so that those efforts will yield greater results.   We agree with the world’s leaders regarding the need to reconsider and reassess the international situation and current political  economic and environmental crises. Indeed  the world has become a village and all events are interlinked  which means that an event in one region of the world will affect events in other regions. Therefore we must engage in dialogue  cooperation  coexistence and understanding in order to emerge from such crises. We also wish to highlight the role of international and regional organizations as mechanisms for promoting dialogue and cooperation. Those are lessons that we have learned from the Iraqi experiment and our own difficulties  and we see no alternative to such an approach in addressing the current complex world situation. Therefore we call on international organizations to rebuild and reactivate their structures and to reduce their routine and bureaucracy.   The problems of the Middle East can be resolved through constructive and meaningful dialogue  in accordance with the resolutions of international legitimacy and the principles of international law. Therefore the Government of Iraq supports the struggle of the Palestinian people to exercise their inalienable rights  including the right to establish an independent State. We call for the implementation of the resolutions   29 08-51845  of international legitimacy in returning the occupied Arab territories. We consider the Arab Peace Initiative endorsed by the Arab Summit to be a good and just basis for the settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict. Therefore  and in order to enhance peace and security in the region  we call for the establishment of a Middle East zone free of weapons of mass destruction.  The Government of Iraq attaches great importance to reform of the United Nations  in particular the Security Council  to improve its performance. While we believe that it is important to expand the Council’s membership to make it more representative and more responsive to the great increase in the number of Member States in comparison with 60 years ago  we also believe that it is essential to improve the Council’s working methods in order to enhance its effectiveness and capacity to perform  which affect the interests of all Member States. At any rate  the increase in the membership of the Council must not affect its effectiveness or efficiency. Promoting stability and prosperity calls for enhancing cooperation among the countries of the world.   We need to improve relations among the sovereign countries of the world and develop the international system so that it will be fairer and better able to assist development programmes in poor and developing countries through increased support from wealthy countries.   In conclusion  allow me on behalf of my country and the people of Iraq to extend congratulations to the President of the General Assembly. We are confident that his wisdom and remarkable qualities will bring about success in the current session of the General Assembly. "
"81",3404,"ISL",63,2008,"Let me first join others in congratulating Mr. d’Escoto Brockmann on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session. I pledge Iceland’s support and cooperation in the important work that lies ahead.  Almost all United Nations Member States recently sent athletes to compete in the Beijing Summer Olympic Games  where the world witnessed outstanding sportsmanship  in terms of both performance and conduct. The Olympics have become a global venue where there is no contradiction between the demonstration of international solidarity and positive patriotism. While recognizing that the example of such a sporting event cannot be applied directly to international relations in the political field  it could still be an inspiration as we seek ways to make our Organization more effective in dealing with the immense global challenges of the twenty-first century. The Olympics reflect the human commonality and aspirations that should be our point of departure.  Extreme poverty continues to remain an obstacle to development and security in many parts of the world. Despite considerable accomplishments in the reduction of poverty  this is still the single most daunting challenge facing mankind and the source of so many other problems with global repercussions. Experience shows that a combination of local  regional and international initiatives is usually required to eradicate the manifold causes of poverty. This includes additional resources for development cooperation.  We  the international community  must fulfil the promises we made to our most vulnerable constituents eking out an existence in extreme poverty  especially in sub-Saharan Africa. They are the ones who depend most on the solidarity of the international community. The forthcoming meeting in Doha on financing for development will test the resolve of the international community and  for its part  Iceland aims to be among the top contributors of official development assistance (ODA)  having already doubled its budget for development cooperation over the past four years.   The Secretary-General has aptly referred to the interconnected challenges of soaring food costs  development and climate change. Indeed  the objective of widespread sustainable development seems ever more distant. But apathy or despair is not an option because  inevitably  the cost of inaction will rise correspondingly. Action needs to be broad-based and sustained  addressing both urgent humanitarian and long-term structural issues. Much can be done to strengthen food security. Iceland  for example  has for decades shared its experience and expertise in modern fisheries with developing coastal States  including through the work of the United Nations University Fisheries Training Programme in Reykjavik. Ninety-five per cent of the people in the world dependent on harvesting living marine resources live in developing countries. We will continue to make a small but   23 08-52265  significant contribution towards improving their lives and thereby further the cause of sustainable development. Our goal of economic prosperity with environmental responsibility is the key to sustainable development and long-term prosperity.  The threat of climate change can be tackled only through the combined efforts of the international community. The urgency of the threat has been highlighted repeatedly by my colleagues from the small island developing States and many least-developed countries. They are the front-line States  exposed and vulnerable to the growing consequences of climate change. Ultimately  though  we will all be affected. It is in that spirit that Iceland welcomes and fully supports the Pacific Island initiative for a General Assembly resolution on security and climate change.  The urgent work started in Kyoto must be accelerated in Copenhagen next year  and carbon emissions need to be systematically reduced. The world can break the dependence on fossil fuels only by offering efficient and economical alternatives. Iceland is fortunate to have abundant hydroelectric and geothermal power and has already reached the goal of deriving about 80 per cent of its energy consumption from clean renewable sources. The resulting expertise and technology have been made available to developing States  and Iceland is proud to host the Geothermal Training Programme of the United Nations University.  Sixty years ago  Eleanor Roosevelt wisely observed that “The Charter of the United Nations is a guiding beacon along the way to the achievement of human rights and fundamental freedoms throughout the world”. As we celebrate the sixtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  her words remind us of the progress already made and the long and difficult road ahead  made more difficult by major new global challenges.  Today’s world does not tolerate racial discrimination and the time has come to make sex discrimination universally unacceptable too. My Government will continue to promote gender equality internationally. We will do it both through multilateral efforts within the United Nations — most notably in the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) — and in the World Bank. Regrettably  gender equality and women’s empowerment remain elusive goals throughout the world. I urge the United Nations to lead by example.  The challenges posed by globalization also offer new opportunities to revitalize the United Nations system and better equip the Organization to meet the challenges of the twenty-first century: better technology  better communications and more efficient management are all available. The United Nations is a long way from being a perfect mechanism  but its role in the international system is indisputable and indispensable. If we settle for a United Nations that sometimes appears to be an abstract objective in itself  we will never fully realize the potential of this universal gathering of nations. On the other hand  if we encourage a high level of ambition and adaptability I am convinced that the United Nations will live up to the ideals of its founders and be celebrated as a cornerstone of the international architecture on the centenary of the Charter in 2045.  One simple method of raising the profile of the United Nations  as well as awareness of its important work  is informing our citizens. I am pleased to inform the Assembly that the Government of Iceland intends to make the purpose and work of the United Nations an integral part of the curriculum at the primary and secondary levels of education in our country  in addition to the existing and more selective activities at higher levels. Iceland strongly encourages all Member States to do the same. This may prove to be an effective means of offering the multilateral ideal of the United Nations as a part of the world view imparted to future leaders and citizens around the globe.  It is perhaps an oversimplification to speak of a contest between multilateralism and unilateralism in international affairs. Those different approaches frequently overlap  but it is clear that when an effective multilateral option is available it will always be the preferred choice for most countries  especially smaller countries such as mine. This should inspire us to make the United Nations a forum that can deliver substantive results  in accordance with international law  in order to ensure that unilateral actions on issues of major significance become less likely.  Iceland has been a responsible and active Member of the United Nations since 1946 and it is now  after 62 years  seeking for the first time to serve as a non-permanent member of the Security Council  with the full support of the other four Nordic countries.    08-52265 24  The election will take place in this Hall in three weeks’ time.  Throughout the history of the United Nations the Nordic countries have been key contributors to the Organization’s peacekeeping and development assistance activities and have been able to play a role that is disproportionate to their share of the global population. Above all  the Nordic countries have shown unwavering commitment to multilateral cooperation and the rule of law. If elected as a member of the Security Council  Iceland will continue in that strong tradition.  We seek the seat as a democratic State not in conflict with other countries; as a State with a history of solving its disputes peacefully; as a State that respects universal human rights; and as a State without substantial geopolitical interests and  therefore  a State that can approach issues with a certain objectivity. We see our candidature not only from a national perspective. It is also a test of whether the smaller States Members of the Organization  from all the regional groups  can have an opportunity to serve on the Council and thus reinforce its legitimacy. The election of Iceland would bolster the principle of sovereign equality and equitable representation.  Academics sometimes associate certain periods in history with countries or regions as a way of highlighting predominant characteristics or trends. It would reflect well on us here today if we had the foresight and courage to take measures in coming years that would give future historians reason to refer to the twenty-first century as the century of the United Nations. "
"82",3451,"ISR",63,2008,"Over 60 years have passed since the General Assembly voted on the historic resolution that would have put an end to the Arab-Israeli conflict. Resolution 181 (II) called for the establishment of a Jewish State and an Arab State. Its title was: “Plan of Partition with Economic Union”. It envisioned two States for two peoples  fulfilling a distinct national aspiration. The Jewish people adopted the resolution and established the State of Israel. The Arabs rejected it  and this led to war.  What happened in the ensuing years is much different from the resolution’s original intent. While much has changed since then  the ironies of history summon similar circumstances today. Today  again  we are in the middle of the lake. There is no sense going back. Continuing forward will show how near we are to achieving the initial goal.  A year prior to Israel’s declaration of statehood  its first Prime Minister  David Ben-Gurion  called me  a young man from a kibbutz  to serve in our national defence. Since then  I have participated in Israel’s dynamic realities: the building of security; the striving for peace. So  I need no books to learn the history  since I witnessed its miraculous unfolding. We went through seven wars. All have paid heavily. Tears still flow down the faces of bereaved mothers. Remembrance days fill the air with silent prayers of widowed families who lost young boys and girls in battle. They are  today  the same age  but lifeless.   Israel turned military victories into peace processes  knowing that the cost of life renders imperfect peace superior to perfect victories.  We have also achieved two peace agreements: the first  with the largest Arab country  Egypt; the second  with the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. All the land  all the water  all the natural resources that fell into our hands through war were completely repatriated after peace was signed.   But for peace  the call in our region is to repair the damaged environment and the wounded land which leads to poverty. If we do not overcome the desert  the thirst  the pollution  they will overcome us. Joint   33 08-51749  ventures can meet this call. Nature does not carry a national passport.  With the Palestinians  we negotiate full peace. Both parties agreed to building a Palestinian State side by side with Israel  living in peace  security and respect. We tried to conclude those negotiations this year. Apparently  this will take a longer time. I believe it can be accomplished  in spite of this  within the next year.  I know that our Prime Minister is more than ready to conclude an agreement. And knowing President Abbas as well  I am sure he will not miss this opportunity. We agreed to progress in spite of possible changes that may take place in the leadership. Gaps have been narrowed through negotiations  particularly  and hopefully  the territorial ones.  But peace is not just a matter of territorial compromise. Rogue politics rejects peace even when and where territorial disputes have been resolved. In Lebanon  we implemented the resolutions of the United Nations  but Hizbullah paralysed the country and cut the road to peace.  From Gaza  we withdrew completely and dismantled all of our settlements. I know there are a great many complaints about the settlements: in Gaza  we dismantled 30 settlements by order of the Government; Hamas responded with a bloody takeover and turned the Strip into a base for rocket fire.  These militants offer no positive alternative but the agonies of Job. They added kidnapping to bombings  bringing strife to innocent families. From this rostrum  I call for the immediate release of Gilad Shalit  the son of Aviva and Noam  a most peace-loving family. This Assembly should place the release of that person at the top of its priorities. Holding a hostage in Gaza  causes Gaza’s isolation and could cause further deterioration.  At the centre of this violence and fanaticism stands Iran. It presents a danger to the entire world. Its quest for religious hegemony and regional dominance divides the Middle East and holds back chances for peace  including among Arabs  while undermining human rights.  Iranian support for Hizbullah divides Lebanon. Its support for Hamas splits the Palestinians; it postpones the establishment of the Palestinian State. Yesterday  from this very rostrum  the Iranian leader renewed the darkest anti-Semitic libel — the “Protocols of the Elders of Zion” — bringing to life one of the ugliest plots against the Jewish people. Their despicable denial of the Holocaust is a mockery of indisputable evidence and a cynical offence against the survivors of the Holocaust  contrary to the resolutions adopted by this very Assembly.  Iran continues to develop enriched uranium and long-range missiles. It has introduced a religion of fear  opposing the call of the Lord to respect human life: all humans; all life. The Iranian people are not our enemies. Their fanatical leadership is their problem and the world’s woe. Their leader is a danger to his own people  to the region and to the world. He is a disgrace to the ancient Iranian people and tradition. He is a disgrace to the values of Islam and all religions. He is a disgrace to this House  the United Nations  and its basic principles and values. His appearance here is a shame.   The Jewish people have known throughout history that they must stand firm and face evil. Enlightened humanity should make it possible for freedom and respect to prevail for all of us.   Tehran combines long-range missiles with short-range minds. It is pregnant with tragedies. The General Assembly and the Security Council bear the responsibility to prevent agonies before they take place.   Israel has shown that democracies can defend themselves. We are able to defend ourselves. We do not intend to change that capacity to defend ourselves.   Terrorism has not solved a single problem. It never has; it never will. It will make the world ungovernable. If groups of killers are allowed to threaten innocent masses  the world — if it continues to survive — will be without order and security  a hopeless battleground. The free world must unite to stop this  to combat it.  Israel  for its part  shall continue to seek peace sincerely and fully. We suggest immediate peace with Lebanon. Israeli Prime Ministers have indicated to Syria that  for peace  we are ready to explore a comprehensive compromise. To gain trust and save time  we have suggested a face-to-face meeting with President Assad. I say to the President: “Follow the successful example set by President Sadat and King Hussein”. We await an answer.    08-51749 34   I know there is a growing concern that peace is far away. My lifelong experience provides me with a different judgement. True  I have seen stagnation  regression and failure in our journey  but today I can identify a road leading in the right direction. In addition to the peace agreements  a series of summits have taken place: Madrid  Oslo  Wye  Camp David  Sharm el-Sheik  Annapolis. In fact  Israelis and Arabs are marching towards peace. After a long internal debate  Israel has chosen to support the two-State solution.  Furthermore  I must say that in Beirut  the Arab League replaced the three “nays” of Khartoum — which were no peace  no negotiation  no recognition — with an initiative inaugurated by King Abdullah Bin Abdulaziz Al Saud. I call upon the King to further his initiative. It may become an invitation for comprehensive peace — one to transform a battleground into a common ground.  I respectfully invite all leaders to come to discuss peace in Jerusalem — which is holy to all of us — where all of us are praying to the same Lord as offspring of the same Father. Israel shall gladly accept an Arab invitation to designate a venue where a meaningful dialogue may take place at their choice.  We are facing a serious economic crisis in the world. Perhaps it has happened because we are rich and light with funds and poor and heavy with ideas  while we live in an era in which science  not land  is the basis for a successful economy. Science does not stop at borders; it is not disturbed by distances. Wisdom cannot be conquered by armies. Knowledge diminishes discrimination because it operates through goodwill and transcends race  nationality  colour and gender.  The global dangers unite and divide us at the same time. The dangers are clear: degradation of the environment  shortage of water  lack of renewable energy  the spread of terrorism and  alas  increased poverty among millions and millions of people. The divisions of the free world may increase them. Unity may offer alternatives. It would direct global investments to new areas and to demanding challenges such as health  security  education and the environment.  The future is not in the hands of oil or gold. Intellectual assets  new inventions and superior education hold the key to the future of each of us. In our region  border areas could become open economic zones  permitting the free movement of people  commodities and ideas. They could encourage tourism and build high-tech incubators. They could cultivate and advance modern agriculture. Economic zones would provide a million jobs and produce billions of cubic metres of desalinated water for the Arabs  for the Palestinians  for the Jordanians  for Israel — for all of us. We have already started to do this; the initial steps are promising.  The Jewish people are celebrating a New Year. I would like to end with a quote by Rabbi Nachman of Breslav:  “May it be thy will to remove war and bloodshed from the world and perpetuate the wonders and greatness of peace. All the inhabitants of the world shall recognize and know the truth: that we have not been placed on this earth to wage war and not for hatred or bloodshed.” I will repeat it in Hebrew.  (The speaker repeated the quote in Hebrew)"
"83",3498,"ITA",63,2008,"Today  we face the reality of an international system that is becoming more complex by the day. Globalization has created new opportunities; it has also produced uncertainty and insecurity. Sudden crises affect the fundamental sources of our sustenance and progress: food  energy and financial resources. Terrorism and nuclear proliferation threaten our security. Climate change has an impact on the future of our planet. Growing instability characterizes the energy and financial markets  widening the gap between rich and poor.   Those global challenges need a timely political response. A national response would be inadequate and illusory  for the right response can only be global and cooperative. A dramatic new vision of global governance for the twenty-first century requires rules that all nations can embrace — a new vision based on three principles: inclusiveness  effectiveness and shared responsibility.  Effective global governance means a central role for the United Nations  starting with its most representative  democratic body  the General Assembly. Effective global governance means a strong connection between the United Nations and international organizations  either universal or regional  such as the European Union and the African Union. Effective global governance requires a comprehensive and consensual reform of the United Nations system  including the Security Council. To achieve a reform of this magnitude on the foundations of strong political support  there is no alternative to general consensus.   We must immediately learn the lessons of the turmoil in the world financial markets. Promoting transparent and reliable rules in the marketplace is the only way to protect our societies from falling prey to those forces. We have to avoid squandering wealth and instead ensure that it is distributed equitably among every component of society. That is the vision that Italy will promote during its upcoming presidency of the Group of Eight (G-8). Through a broader dialogue with the emerging economies and the least developed countries  the G-8 will contribute to the shaping of a new system of global governance in which formats will be tailored to specific issues  leading to a gradual assumption of shared responsibility.  The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) are priority challenges. They demand an urgent response  a mobilization of greater human and financial resources  new ideas and a true partnership between donor and beneficiary countries that is fully inclusive of governments  local organizations  the private sector and civil society.  Italy is strongly committed to achieving the goals of defeating hunger  strengthening health-care systems and making education accessible to all. All this is on the agenda of the upcoming Italian presidency of the G-8  and Africa will be at the centre of our attention.  The right place to address the food crisis is the United Nations  and we must equip the Organization to tackle it effectively. Italy strongly supports the roles and functions of the Food and Agriculture Organization  the World Food Programme  the International Fund for Agricultural Development and all the other agencies that help to alleviate hunger and guarantee food security. We also encourage the direct involvement of the private sector in bringing agriculture back to its rightful place at the centre of economic policies. That will require a global partnership to increase the flow of investments and know-how  enhance productivity and contribute to the development of national agro-industry; a global partnership that will make a big step towards achieving the first Millennium Development Goal: to eliminate extreme poverty and hunger and to improve the lives of the last billion  that portion of the global population still on the margins of the world economy. That is  indeed  an absolute priority.  The year 2009 will be crucial for international negotiations on climate change. Italy and the European Union are determined to reach an ambitious post-2012 agreement that includes mitigation and adaptation measures. The fight against climate change is closely connected to energy security. We need to promote greater energy cooperation at the global level. We need to promote solutions that reconcile the need for secure    08-52265 50  supplies with sustainable energy policies  energy efficiency and clean energy technologies. We need to promote research and development of alternative fuel sources  including renewable and nuclear energy. We need to promote a comprehensive dialogue between producing and consuming countries  based on mutual trust  solidarity  dialogue and cooperation.  Interdependence is the fundamental reality that binds developed countries and emerging economies  and in its capacity as the incoming G-8 President  Italy will promote the energy dialogue and the global negotiations on climate change.  Effective multilateral cooperation built on shared responsibility is vital to tackling the main threats to our safety and security  including terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Our vigilance against terrorism must remain high and our international cooperation intense. In the next few years we should work together on a new global pact against terrorism to be enacted in 2011 on the tenth anniversary of the tragic events of 9/11.  The protection of human rights and the rule of law must underpin our action. These values are enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  which is as relevant today as it was 60 years ago. That is why Italy has a long-standing commitment to a universal moratorium on the death penalty  with a view to its abolition. And that is also why we are working to combat impunity and to strengthen the instruments of international law  including the International Criminal Court.  The fight against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is at the centre of our international commitment. In preparation for the 2010 Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference  Italy is ready to do its part to strengthen the Non-Proliferation Treaty  which is of fundamental importance to preventing and countering proliferation and laying the foundations for a world free of nuclear weapons. Yet we must also maintain cooperation on the peaceful use of nuclear technology  as expressly provided for by the Treaty. We thus call upon the Iranian Government to show responsibility by promptly meeting the conditions for normal negotiations to reassure the international community and the countries of the region. Let me say very clearly that we strongly condemn the Iranian President’s irresponsible remarks on the State of Israel.   Global security and regional security are very closely connected. We welcome the positive signals from the Middle East  such as the continuation of the negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians  the beginning of a national dialogue among the Lebanese political forces to fully implement the Doha agreements  and the new chapter in relations between Lebanon and Syria.  In Afghanistan  the continuation of the international commitment should be accompanied by a gradual assumption of responsibility by the local authorities and forces and the participation of neighbouring countries in the stabilization process. In the Caucasus  the recent crisis indicates the need  there and elsewhere  to strengthen regional cooperation mechanisms and prevent a competitive dynamic that would lead to high costs and low benefits.  More than two hundred years ago a great Italian political philosopher Cesare Beccaria wrote  “The greatest happiness of the greatest number is the foundation of morals and legislation.” True to these words  so deeply rooted in my country’s democratic vocation  Italy joins in the common effort to build a world of peace  security  sustainable development and a new democratic  transparent and effective global governance. "
"84",3544,"JAM",63,2008,"It is perhaps fortuitous that my own Deputy Prime Minister happens to be presiding over the Assembly at the time when I address the Assembly for the very first time. But it is not true  as someone suggested to me just before I came to the rostrum  that we have come to the sixty-third session of the General Assembly believing that we are still at the Olympics in Beijing. Neither is it true that my name is Usain Bolt. My name is Bruce Golding.   I offer Mr. D’Escoto Brockmann my congratulations on his presidency and I ask you  Mr. Vice-President  to convey those congratulations to him. He has assumed that office at a time when the world faces challenges of crisis proportions. Much will be demanded of his leadership  and I want you  Sir  to assure him of Jamaica’s full support and cooperation in all of his endeavours.   21 08-52272   We have convened amid worrying global developments. The hopes of the new millennium are in danger of fading as the ideals of international harmony and shared global prosperity remain elusive. Globalization  despite its promise of expanded production and trade  has been uneven in the spread of its benefits and  for many countries  marginal in its impact. Indeed  the gap between rich and poor has widened within and among countries.  The global economy now appears to be headed for a severe downturn. Developments in the global financial system  the painful increase in oil and commodity prices and the escalating food crisis threaten to plunge vast sections of the world’s population deeper into poverty. Fiscal challenges and the crippling burden of debt render many countries incapable of responding to the crisis. Countries like Jamaica are called upon to respond within our limited capacity to protect the most vulnerable.  In the long term  however  our hopes for survival will require huge investments  improved productivity  better access to the world’s markets and human capacity-building. Developing countries cannot be left to find their own solutions. The situation requires a collaborative  coordinated and global response. That is not mere altruism. It is an indisputable truth that  if developed countries assist developing countries to improve their economies  their productive capacity and the purchasing power of their people  they will expand the markets for their own goods and services. It is the interdependency that we share and that is manifested in so many other areas  from climate change to global epidemics  organized crime and human trafficking.  Solving the problem of developing countries requires more than mere liberalization of trade  more than mere privatization of the economy and more than the mere free flow of capital. It requires a sincere and sustained effort that focuses on the limitations that bedevil developing countries. Global development  not just global markets  must be at the centre of our priorities.  Poverty and wealth should not have to coexist. Poverty can be eradicated. The tools of development exist and are capable of transforming the world  empowering the poor and enabling them to rise from their poverty. We must therefore commit ourselves to creating a world in which not everyone may be rich  but no one has to be poor.  In 2001  we committed ourselves to achieving the Millennium Development Goals by 2015. We are now at the halfway mark and we are behind schedule. It is time to take stock to see where we are  who is falling behind  and what must be done to make up lost ground.  A critical success factor must be the partnership between developed and developing countries as defined in the 2002 Monterrey Consensus on financing for development  integrating aid  debt relief  market access  good governance and foreign direct investment. Those initiatives were carefully calibrated. Proceeding with some elements without the others will not achieve the goals we have set. Indeed  it might make it worse.  We must all pull up our socks if we are to reverse the slippage we have suffered. Developing countries must ensure that their priorities are properly structured. Developed countries must live up to their commitment to devote 0.7 per cent of their gross national income to official development assistance. That is a modest amount  yet only five countries have so far done so.  The focus of development cooperation cannot  I submit  be too narrowly defined. The varied economic and social profiles of developing countries require a more flexible response that recognizes investment in human capital  infrastructure and the transfer of technology as critical elements in reducing poverty in a sustained way.  That is particularly important to developing countries that are classified  based on per capita income  as middle-income countries. That classification deprives them of access to concessionary financing and creative measures to reduce the crippling debt burden that afflicts so many of them. If we are to reduce poverty  the peculiar circumstances of those countries cannot be ignored since that is where more than one third of the world’s poor are to be found.  We call on the international community to devise strategic programmes to address the peculiar needs of middle-income countries with deep pockets of poverty. Because of those factors and because of our exposure to frequent natural disasters  which in the matter of a few hours can reverse gains that took years to accomplish  Jamaica and its Caribbean Community (CARICOM) partners are proposing the international recognition of CARICOM States as a special category of small vulnerable and highly indebted middle-income countries.    08-52272 22   The international financial system  designed more than 60 years ago in the context of those times  has undergone very little change in its governance  structure and practices. However  the world has changed and that requires a re-engineering of the global financial system. Jamaica supports the call for reform of the existing financial infrastructure to reflect the new global realities and make it more proactive and responsive to the needs of the entire world community. I want to suggest  however  that it must involve more than merely expanding the membership of an exclusive club. It must be development-driven  recognizing that poverty anywhere is a threat to prosperity elsewhere. It must include mechanisms to detect signs of global crises and must be able to institute preventive measures.  The crisis currently rocking the world’s financial markets reflects the inadequacy of the regulatory structures that are essential to the effective functioning of any market. But it is more than that. It represents the failure on the part of the international financial system to facilitate the flow of resources into areas where they can produce real wealth  not paper wealth. The world is not short of capital. What it lacks are the mechanisms to ensure the efficient utilization of that capital.  I want to suggest that another urgent task is the creation of a viable and equitable international trading system. Jamaica is deeply disappointed that the Doha Development Round has failed to deliver on the promise of an open  fair and predictable multilateral trading system. We urge all parties to resolve the outstanding differences  particularly on the removal of trade-distorting agricultural subsidies  and to address the need for special safeguard mechanisms for economically challenged countries.   The need for more concerted action on global warming is impatient of debate. Developing countries are the most vulnerable  but they are also the least capable of mitigation measures. Countries that are the major pollutants must bear the major share of the responsibility for corrective action. They must make binding commitments to fulfil that responsibility. The purchase of carbon credits  especially from developing countries  must not exculpate them from that responsibility.  Jamaica calls for a fair  equitable and balanced long-term scheme to bind emission caps within a new international framework beyond 2012  when the Kyoto Protocol expires.   The impact of climate change on agricultural output  and the frequency and intensity of natural disasters to which countries like Jamaica are particularly vulnerable  point to the need for a global environment management structure that establishes clear standards and enforces compliance.  Jamaica is concerned that political instability in many parts of the world  often fuelled by extremism and intolerance  continues to threaten regional and international peace and security. They are neither limited in scope nor confined to national borders. Resolving those conflicts requires effective diplomacy and global cooperation  and the United Nations must continue to use its good offices to secure just and peaceful settlements.  Our intense focus on combating terrorism and transnational organized crime  and eliminating nuclear arms and other weapons of mass destruction must not  however  marginalize the need for decisive action to curb the illicit trade in small arms  which facilitate internal violence in many of our countries and result in high levels of homicide. Jamaica supports the establishment of an arms trade treaty to impose strict controls on the illegal trade in small arms and ammunition.  The persistent humanitarian crisis in Darfur continues to be a matter of serious concern to all of us. We are disappointed that the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur is not yet fully operational. We urge all parties to desist from actions that could deepen the crisis  jeopardize the safety of the civilian population and of United Nations personnel and prevent access to humanitarian relief.  Jamaica remains irrevocably committed to finding a just  lasting and peaceful solution to the Middle East conflict — a solution that must ensure the security of Israel and the establishment of a viable Palestinian State.  The United Nations must continue to play a pivotal role through its peacekeeping missions in the creation of sustainable peace in post-conflict situations. Jamaica will use its membership in the Peacebuilding Commission to underscore the importance of sustained  long-term economic development in rebuilding and   23 08-52272  transforming countries that have been wracked by conflict.  The devastation wrought in Haiti by recent hurricanes has aggravated the already harsh conditions under which the Haitian people are forced to live. Much more needs to be done not only in providing emergency relief  but also in addressing the long-term social  economic and development needs of that country  as a sustainable solution to the fragile humanitarian situation that exists there. Haiti needs and deserves the support of the entire international community.  We are gathered here this week as Members of that union we call the United Nations. What is the state of that union? We must not ignore the cynicism that exists in some quarters about the continued value of the United Nations. Those cynics have not bothered to contemplate what the world would be like if the United Nations did not exist. But we have contributed to that cynicism  so often bending the facts to suit our own design  breaking the rules to secure a particular advantage and making commitments without the will to honour them.  Reform of the structure and procedures of the United Nations is an imperative whose time has long come. Let us not bury it in procrastination and incessant squabbling. It is time for constructive  consensus-building dialogue. The need for changes in the structure and scope of the Security Council has been under discussion for almost 15 years  bogged down in polarized  adversarial positions.  We have a compelling duty to put in place systems that can secure peace and prosperity for the future. We therefore welcome the unanimous adoption of decision 62/557  contained in paragraph 23 of document A/62/47  which  we hope  will provide resolve for the early commencement of intergovernmental negotiations within a specified time frame and in the context of an informal plenary meeting of the General Assembly.  The sixtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights serves to remind us of the central role of the United Nations in promoting human rights and fundamental freedoms. Those are essential components of the environment required for sustained development. It was consistent with that principle that we launched the initiative to erect a monument to honour the victims of slavery. I thank the Secretary-General and the members of the committee for their support and assistance. I also thank Member States that have made or pledged contributions. We invite other States to do likewise.  Six decades ago  the founding fathers of the United Nations agreed that the Organization should be a mechanism for harmonizing the actions of nations in the achievement of our common goals: peace and prosperity throughout the world  respect and tolerance among the powerful and support for the weak and vulnerable. That remains our mandate  our unfinished business. Fulfilling that mandate and advancing that mission will require a more proactive United Nations  one that is more responsive to the needs of Member States and gives equal attention to issues of peace  security and development. The hopes of people everywhere in the world depend on us  the leadership that we provide and the will that we exert for the times in which we live. We must not fail them. "
"85",3590,"JOR",63,2008,"I wish to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session. I wish him every success in leading us as we work to strengthen the role   15 08-53135  of the United Nations in promoting international relations in the spirit of the Charter  which is the most important international pillar of the rule of law. I also thank his predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Srgjan Kerim  for his good efforts to ensure the success of the previous session. In addition  I wish to commend the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  for his efforts to reform the Organization so that it can play a more effective role in addressing emerging global challenges.  In his introductory statement on 16 September 2008 (see A/63/PV.1)  the day he assumed the presidency of the Assembly  Mr. d’Escoto Brockmann referred to many important political and humanitarian issues. For example  he mentioned the need to improve United Nations organs to enable them to adapt to the major changes that have occurred in the international sphere in the 63 years since the Organization was established following the Second World War. He also stated that the Organization should be improved so that it can better address the accelerated changes that have taken place since the end of the cold war and the era of polarization — changes whose effects have begun to be felt over the past two decades.   In that context  Jordan believes it is essential to revitalize the role of the General Assembly as envisaged in the Charter  so that the international decision-making process can be further democratized. Jordan supports the trend towards rebalancing the relationship between the General Assembly and the Security Council.  A week ago  at the 5th meeting  the Secretary-General introduced his report on the work of the Organization (A/63/1)  in which he assessed the world situation. In the report  he made clear that we face challenges that encompass all human activities  transcending individual countries and regions. Hence  we must examine the dangers posed by those challenges — many of which have their roots in ideology and similar motivations — in order to find appropriate solutions and move effectively forward together. Among the challenges cited by the Secretary-General are the lack of progress in international trade negotiations  high energy costs and basic food prices and climate change. While we support the Secretary-General’s assessment  we should like to add that additional challenges are posed by continued military occupation  denial of the rights of peoples to self-determination and freedom of expression  the growing crisis of intercultural conflict and the scourge of international terrorism and extremism.  The most important role being played by the United Nations in the Middle East region has been and remains that of the custodian of international law. On the one hand  it governs international relations and is the standard by which we measure progress made in the international community; on the other  it embodies a strong  objective approach to the maintenance of international peace and security.   Because of our strong belief in the role of the United Nations  we view the Organization as the basic framework for finding a solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict  putting an end to the occupation of Arab lands and redressing the injustices suffered by the Palestinian people. For decades  the Arab States have taken many initiatives and made many proposals  based on international legitimacy  to achieve a peaceful solution to the conflict so that the Palestinians can be liberated from Israeli occupation and can live in dignity in their own homeland.   To that end  in 2002 the Arab States jointly submitted a comprehensive Arab Peace Initiative. It sought to end the 60-year-old conflict as well as Israel’s occupation of Arab lands — Palestinian  Syrian and Lebanese territories — since 1967  in exchange for a comprehensive peace that would include mutual recognition between Israel and the Arab States  including the State of Palestine  and the establishment of normal relations between them. The Arab Peace Initiative was and continues to be an open and clear invitation to Israel to become part of our region without conditions or restrictions.  While the Initiative was widely welcomed by the nations of the world and was adopted by 57 States members of the Organization of the Islamic Conference  Israel ignored it and began to build the wall of separation  in defiance of the Advisory Opinion of the International Court of Justice  and intensified its settlement activities  which threaten its chances to make peace with the Palestinian people and the Arabs.  The President took the Chair.  The efforts of the Quartet are essential to move the political process forward and to find a solution that  in accordance with international legitimacy  ends the Israeli occupation  dismantles the settlements  fulfils the aspirations of the Palestinian people to establish    08-53135 16  their own State in their homeland  including East Jerusalem  and enables the refugees to return to their homes and villages  from which they were expelled in 1948.  From this rostrum  Jordan affirms that it supports the negotiations that resumed at Annapolis and values the strategic option of peace reaffirmed in the Arab Peace Initiative and the two-State solution. At the same time  we believe that the challenges faced by the negotiations as we approach the end of the year require the international community to demand that the parties to the negotiations meet their commitments and that the Quartet make further efforts to achieve the desired results regarding final status negotiations and the fulfilment of the Road Map obligations.  The final months of 2008 will be a critical period in the course of those negotiations. Therefore  it is imperative that Israel have the political will to resolve the ongoing conflict  after more than six decades. In addition  the Palestinian people should be supported on their own land and the Palestinian National Authority should be strengthened to help it to continue fulfilling its obligations  improving the conditions for Palestinians in the occupied Palestinian territories and building State institutions. That also requires Palestinians to bridge their differences against the backdrop of the Arab Peace Initiative and to promote the position of the Palestinian National Authority both on the international scene and in the context of the negotiations.  While all parties strive to reach a final solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict  Israel continues its illegal practices of seizing Arab land in order to change the demographic make-up of the occupied territories through the building of settlements and the separation wall  and changing the status of Jerusalem  in clear violation of international law  the principles of international legitimacy and the provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War. Recent speed in building Israeli settlements threatens to erode all progress achieved so far in the peace process.   We reject all Israeli measures that aim to create a new status quo in the occupied Palestinian territories  particularly in East Jerusalem  including threats to the Islamic and Arab character of the holy city. We reaffirm that Israeli violations in the holy city  and particularly in the Bab al-Magharibah area  contradict the norms of international law  the Fourth Geneva Convention  The Hague Convention of 1954  as well as the July 2008 decision of UNESCO’s World Heritage Committee. As Jordan has played a historic role in the supervision and maintenance of Islamic holy places in Jerusalem  we call upon Israel to comply with its pledges and obligations and to put an end to those illegal practices.   Unless there is justice for the Palestinian people  our region will be subjected to a long era of destabilization. But ours will not be the only region affected by that destabilization  because the feelings of injustice  disappointment and anger will increase as a result of stagnation in the peace process. This will fuel extremism in its various forms and manifestations and will be used as a pretext by those who would like to destabilize the region and the world beyond.   I would like to congratulate the brotherly people of Lebanon on having achieved national reconciliation  on the election of a President and the formation of a Government of national unity. I also congratulate them on embarking on an extensive and profound process of national dialogue aimed at strengthening Lebanese State institutions and seeking ways to defend Lebanese territory and sovereignty.  Concerning Iraq  we welcome the remarkable progress made in that brotherly country and the improvement of the situation at all levels. Jordan recently reopened and adequately staffed its embassy in Baghdad. His Majesty King Abdullah II of Jordan recently visited the brotherly country of Iraq; his visit was widely welcomed at the Arab and international levels. We encourage all channels of political and economic communication between Iraq and other Arab countries  and we encourage the Iraqi Government to continue its approach to developing channels of national reconciliation in order to build upon the progress achieved so far in the areas of politics and security. Such progress encourages Iraqis to return to their country from neighbouring States and the building of a society based on political diversity and free of sectarianism  factionalism and other harms to society.  Making the Middle East a zone free of weapons of mass destruction is a prerequisite for ensuring the peace and stability of the region. In 1970  based on our belief in and support for the preventive goals of nuclear non-proliferation  we  joined other countries in   17 08-53135  the world and the region  with the exception of Israel  in acceding to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. We call upon the international community and influential States to bring pressure to bear in order to ensure accession by all countries to that international Treaty in order to achieve a nuclear weapon-free zone in the Middle East in accordance with international agreements  and to put an end to nuclear military programmes in the region once and for all.  Concerning the Iranian nuclear issue  we believe that every nation should exercise its right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy. But  at the same time  we call for a resolution of that issue  based on a peaceful approach and on negotiations. In that regard  Jordan attaches great importance to promoting security and stability in the Arabian Gulf area in accordance with the principles of international legitimacy  good-neighbourliness and non-interference in the internal affairs of States. We welcome any effective contribution by Arab States that would maintain undiminished security and stability in our region.  Jordan and the whole region have suffered from the scourge of international terrorism. That has made us more vigilant  cautious and determined to effectively combat terrorism with a view to eradicating it. Jordan upholds international counter-terrorism conventions and values international cooperation in that area. We have also taken the necessary national measures  including legislative measures  to combat that scourge effectively and to support international efforts to combat it.   Manifestations of extremism in the region are often based on politicized pretexts that serve the narrow interests of certain groups. Such groups misrepresent the true Islamic religion and use it as a cover for their deeds  thereby threatening the forces of moderation and projecting an incorrect image of Islam to the world. In that regard  His Majesty King Abdullah II  in his Amman message  called upon all Muslim nations to project the proper image of Islam.   As we are about to celebrate the first decade of the auspicious reign of His Majesty King Abdullah II  we are very proud of the great achievements made during his reign and look forward to even greater achievements in the years ahead. During that decade  Jordanian participation in peacekeeping operations expanded  reaching a cumulative total of 60 000 men and women who have served in 20 missions on four continents. That contribution reflects our serious and unreserved commitment to enhancing international peace and security.  By the end of 2008  our economy will have doubled in size since a decade ago. Per capita income will have grown by 65 per cent. Exports and investment will have increased threefold. Jordan has implemented ambitious reform plans towards the liberalization of foreign trade and the enhancement of the business environment. We have strengthened the programmes and institutions of good governance and political development  enhanced the role of women and the protection of human rights  combated corruption and made breakthroughs in the areas of health and education. The Government is also carrying out ambitious programmes towards political  economic and social reform and development in accordance with the national agenda  with a view to achieving a better future for the country. This is of particular importance because young people represent 60 per cent of our population.  In spite of all those efforts  programmes and successes  successive crises in our region continue to present great challenges to our development process. Those challenges are exacerbated by the severe current economic crises and increased prices of food and fuel  leading to increased inflation of about 15 per cent. Here I would like to reaffirm that international efforts to address economic challenges should take into account the voices of countries such as Jordan so that all may benefit from international efforts to address the challenges of the international economic  food and energy crises  in particular through programmes and mechanisms that take into consideration the specific situations of those States. "
"86",3637,"JPN",63,2008,"It is my great honour to stand here as the new Japanese Prime Minister — brand new  really  as I was designated by the National Diet yesterday.   First  I would like to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly. I extend my heartfelt appreciation to His Excellency Mr. Srgjan Kerim  former President of the General Assembly  for his devoted efforts during his tenure. I wish also to express my profound respect for the tireless leadership demonstrated by His Excellency Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in the management of the United Nations.  Being back in New York  I am reminded of an old saying about bankers. It seems that there are only two types of bankers in the world: bankers with short memories and bankers with no memories. In finance  market crazes and panics cling together in much the same way that shadows follow objects. Crazes invariably develop over time  which then give rise to panic. It was 10 years ago  in September indeed  that the world experienced a nightmare in which liquidity suddenly dried up. For more than the last quarter century  it seems almost as if crazes and panics have performed a never-ending musical rondo every few years  with a large number of countries and markets  naturally including Tokyo  as their stage.  Tokyo stayed relatively clear-headed during the most recent frenzy. However  that said  it could be argued that that was due to little more than the unusually long time we had suffered when our hangover morphed into a debt overhang as a result of the previous craze of the 1980s and 1990s.  That rondo continues without end  and so certainly humankind will once again hear that very same melody in the not-too-distant future. We simply must advance inch by inch each time and resolve to become more prudent. Vociferous arguments on the international financial architecture are about to begin once again. Japan is eager to contribute its experience and its knowledge.  In Japan  May is the month for enjoying new green growth  and 7 July is the day on which both children and adults tie strips of paper bearing handwritten wishes to bamboo branches hung from the eaves and look to the night sky as they pray for their dreams to come true.  This year in May  Japan held the Fourth Tokyo International Conference on African Development  also known as TICAD IV  bringing together some 3 000 participants in the port city of Yokohama. Representatives of 51 nations from Africa gathered  including 41 at the Head of State and Government level. Enthusiastically advocating action “Towards a Vibrant Africa”  that Conference called for support to accelerate economic growth  to pursue the Millennium Development Goals in a sustainable manner and to foster health  water  sanitation and education in Africa on the basis of human security  a concept that Japan has carefully nurtured. Three thousand people renewed their determination to achieve those goals. The vibrancy of Japan’s fresh green leaves certainly touched the heart of each participant.  Then  on 7 July  the day on which we pray for the realization of our dreams for the future  the Government of Japan moved the stage to Lake Toyako on our northern island of Hokkaido  opening the G-8 Summit and a series of outreach meetings. Again  Japan placed issues regarding development among the main themes  and we invited a large number of African participants. That was to ensure that the momentum generated by TICAD IV would be firmly maintained.  By making climate change the theme of another summit  we were able to agree to strive to adopt a global long-term target of reducing emissions and to seek to create  within the United Nations  an effective framework  in which all major economies would participate in a responsible way. That outcome of the Toyako summit should be regarded as no small matter. We aim to realize those goals by no later than the end of 2009.  I believe that we all associate efforts to address climate change with the name of Japan’s ancient capital for 1 000 years  Kyoto. Japan has always felt some pride on that score. Japan leads the globe in requiring the least amount of energy to produce one unit of gross domestic product. Our technological creativity has helped to make that possible. We are eager for the world to make much greater use of it. The   27 08-51851  sectoral approach also offers a channel through which Japan aims to contribute to many other countries.  Such was the G-8 achievement just over two months ago with Japan in the Chair. We are now witnessing irregularities in the global economy. It is my wish  and indeed  my belief  that the pledges of May and the dreams of July will be impervious to the strong and fast winds that now buffet them. There is an important precondition for both making a vibrant Africa even more vibrant and ending global environmental degradation through the efforts of all nations  namely  the stability of the global economy.  That being the case  the task ahead for Japan  as I see it  is already quite clear: it must first invigorate its own economy. In view of the size of the Japanese economy  the second largest in the world  that would certainly be the most immediately effective contribution that Japan can make. I will work determinedly to that end. Such is my pledge to the President and members of this Assembly.  I should now like to change topic and recount a small event that took place this past summer. It happened in a small town on the outskirts of Tokyo. Nine high-school students from abroad arrived there at the end of August  setting foot in Japan for their first time. There was nothing unusual about those very typical-looking high-school student visitors  grimacing at the unfamiliar food placed before them. However  there was one aspect in which those young men and women stood apart from participants in conventional invitation programmes. Those high-school students  four Palestinians and five Israelis  had all lost at least one relative as a result of terrorism or another aspect of the severe situation in the Middle East.  I have just described one of the ongoing efforts by Japanese civil society to promote reconciliation. Those high-school students may have no chance to interact with each other when they are back home  but for the several days that they are in a distant country  travelling here and there across the beautiful  verdant land of Japan in pairs comprising Israelis and Palestinians  something changes inside them. Those young people come to understand that religion and ethnicity make no difference when it comes to the sorrow felt at losing a parent  and they often shed tears upon coming to that realization. Through those tears of understanding they will come to see ties between their futures.  For comprehensive peace in the Middle East  what is necessary is the mental groundwork that will make such peace possible. By investing in the young minds of high-school students  Japanese civil society is working to foster that groundwork.  As that example suggests  there is no doubt in my mind that there are certain types of diplomacy that Japan is uniquely able to undertake. If Israeli drip irrigation technology were to be introduced in the West Bank of the Jordan River  Palestinian youth would be able to devote themselves to the production of vegetables. However  the wall of distrust that separates the two sides will not allow that in the immediate future. Here  Japan wishes to act as a catalyst  serving as a mediator between the two sides.   Japan is willing to bring its own technologies that maximize the potential of drip irrigation. In time  as a result of irrigation  the land of the West Bank will become fertile. The agricultural products grown there will be processed by Palestinians and transported through Jordan to be laid out fresh in stores in consumer regions around the Gulf. The Government of Japan aims to bring about such a future through its Corridor for Peace and Prosperity initiative. Here  Japan continues to provide its technologies and funding  but most of all  it aims to be a mediator  fostering trust. Needless to say  trust is the scarcest resource of all in the Middle East.  The Government of Japan is currently preparing to submit a draft resolution on the total elimination of nuclear weapons. I believe that there is no one who questions the wholehearted commitment of the Japanese people to that issue. In the same way  I believe it would be superfluous to elaborate on the fact that Japan values the activities of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Japan has fielded Mr. Yukiya Amano  Ambassador to the International Organizations in Vienna and former Chairman of the Board of Governors of IAEA  as a candidate to be the next Director-General of IAEA. I strongly urge members to support his candidacy.  Just a moment ago  I touched briefly on the significance of 7 July for Japan. The Heads of State and Government and their spouses who gathered in Toyako for the G8 Summit wrote their wishes on bamboo leaves. While the words they chose varied  there was not a single person who did not include a wish for peace. Yet in the short space of time since    08-51851 28  then  there have been incidents at various locations disturbing the peace  one after another.  First  regarding the situation in Georgia  I strongly expect to see a peaceful resolution of the issues  based on the principle of territorial integrity; with the parties involved  including Russia  acting in a responsible manner. And speaking of 7 July  that date conjures up abhorrent memories in the United Kingdom. We  here in this Assembly  have been newly incensed at the cruel terrorist attack that took place in Islamabad five days ago. It has also turned out to be difficult to find the path towards improving the situation in Afghanistan. There has been no change whatsoever in the fact that terrorism constitutes the greatest threat to peace and prosperity in the world.  I believe that the international community must continue to be engaged in tenacious efforts to combat terrorism. Japan has  from the start  been committed to reconstruction assistance to Afghanistan and we have maintained our refuelling activities in the Indian Ocean. I would like to state here that Japan will continue in the future to stand side by side with the international community and participate proactively in the fight against terrorism.  Among outstanding issues in the vicinity of Japan  it goes without saying that the most pressing are those concerning North Korea. North Korea has abducted Japanese citizens  including an innocent young girl named Megumi. Despite pledging to relaunch an investigation into the abduction victims  it has still not taken action towards fulfilling that pledge.  Regarding its commitment to abandon its nuclear programmes  it is widely known that recently there has been a conspicuous lack of progress. In parallel with the action that North Korea would take  I am prepared to take action towards the resolution of the outstanding issues of concern between Japan and North Korea and the settlement of the unfortunate past tensions between us  moving Japan-North Korea relations forward. What we are waiting for is action by North Korea. I will also continue to pursue the abandonment of North Korea’s nuclear capabilities and its nuclear weapons within the framework of the Six-Party Talks.  That leads me to say that China and the Republic of Korea are each important partners for Japan and countries with which Japan must seek to increase mutual benefits and shared interests. Japan must promote multilayered cooperation with both of those countries as well as with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Together  we must enhance the peace and prosperity of the East Asian region and beyond — towards world peace and prosperity.  As I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks  I have only recently become Japan’s Prime Minister. I was designated Prime Minister by the Diet and appointed by His Majesty the Emperor of Japan barely 24 hours ago  and this is my first engagement since assuming office. I hope that through my remarks thus far you can appreciate why I have taken such pains to join you here today. There are numerous points I wanted to raise.  Looking back  Japan has come a long way  with the Japan-United States alliance as a permanent cornerstone  while steadfastly enhancing relationships with neighbouring Asian nations. And I believe that the President of this Assembly and all the other dignitaries gathered in this Hall will  without exception  acknowledge that Japan attaches great importance to the United Nations and has never once veered from the path of international cooperation.   Even though they have suffered setbacks at times  the citizens of Japan  who have so vigorously pursued the building of the economy  have been guided by a single philosophy until the present day  that peace and happiness are most certainly within our grasp through the pursuit of economic prosperity and democracy. I am determined to work in solidarity with countries holding fundamental values in common and to share Japan’s experiences with nations strongly needing such support. It is my unwavering view that this is a responsibility incumbent on Japan.  It is for these reasons that  speaking on behalf of the people of Japan  I must state and reiterate the absolute necessity of United Nations Security Council reform. We must bring about the early reform of the Security Council through an expansion of both the permanent and non-permanent memberships. Next month  new non-permanent members of the Council will be elected  and Japan is standing as a candidate.   Let me conclude my remarks today by expressing my sincere wish for the support of Member States for Japan’s candidacy. "
"87",3662,"KAZ",63,2008,"First of all  I would like to congratulate the President of the General Assembly on his election to his high office and to express my confidence that  under his able stewardship  the sixty-third session of the General Assembly will be fruitful and successful.  When Christopher Columbus reached the shores of America in 1492  he believed that he had discovered a new route to India. Today we know that  many years before Columbus made that voyage  European explorers had reached Saint Lawrence Bay. Obviously  prior to the so-called discovery of America  developed civilizations had already existed there. At the same time  Columbus did discover America in a certain sense  because it radically altered the understanding of world geography.  It is globalization that is giving us a new vision of the world in the twenty-first century. While offering new opportunities to the world economy and human development  globalization is also triggering a new surge of political and economic competition worldwide.  We can now see clearly that it is imperative to prevent the interests of peoples and countries from being sacrificed for the sake of that competition. Given recent complications and disputes  it is urgent that we preserve the basic principles of international law  including that of territorial integrity. It is crucial that we avoid double standards in the application of that principle.  Despite the efforts being undertaken  the world is not becoming a safer place. We must admit that there is still no international consensus regarding the issues of disarmament and the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. As everyone knows  history could repeat itself if we do not learn its lessons properly. Therefore  nuclear disarmament and an enhanced non-proliferation regime should become a priority for all  without any conditionalities.   Kazakhstan  a country that voluntarily relinquished the fourth-largest nuclear arsenal in the world  believes that it is absolutely imperative to develop new mechanisms for adapting the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to new realities. We call on Member States to finalize the necessary procedures for the entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and the strengthening of its verification mechanism. That is precisely the purpose of the integrated on-site inspection field exercise currently being conducted in our country at the former Semipalatinsk nuclear testing ground.  The crisis of the non-proliferation regime poses the real threat that nuclear weapons will fall into the hands of terrorists. Kazakhstan is actively participating in the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism and in that regard hosted this year the Atom anti-terror exercises and an international conference on the physical protection of nuclear material.   The situation in Afghanistan remains a matter of grave concern. In our opinion  the way to normalize the situation is to build up the international community’s efforts for the peaceful reconstruction of Afghanistan. To that end  the Government of my county has adopted a special plan on assistance to Afghanistan.  Kazakhstan is committed to timely and effective achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). We have already reached a number of targets in several areas  including poverty reduction  access to education and the empowerment of women. Now we are embarking on the MDG-Plus targets  adapted to our national conditions  in order to set up higher benchmarks and indicators.  Like many other countries  Kazakhstan is deeply concerned about the situation regarding the global food market. We share the view of the majority that an integrated approach is required to overcome the current food crisis.  Today the international community faces the challenge of a global rise in basic food prices. Kazakhstan  as a major producer and exporter of grain crops and flour  is prepared to make a substantial contribution to overcoming the food crisis. As of 1 September 2008  we have lifted our ban on grain exports. That is our contribution to the international community’s collective efforts to curb global grain prices.  Because of the critical importance of energy resources  preserving the global energy balance has become a more urgent imperative. Kazakhstan fully understands its ever-increasing role and responsibility as a reliable energy supplier.   Bearing in mind that energy and environmental problems are closely interconnected  I would like to once again draw attention to the initiatives set forth by  A/63/PV.13 23 08-53122  the President of Kazakhstan  Nursultan Nazarbayev  from this rostrum a year ago (see A/62/PV.4). They call for adoption of a Eurasian pact on the stability of energy supplies  as well as development of a global energy and environment strategy within the United Nations framework.  Kazakhstan attaches critical importance to problems associated with climate change and sustainable development. To ensure the convergence of the European and Asian processes of transition to sustainable development and their merging into a single Eurasian process  Kazakhstan has put forward an initiative on convening in 2010 a conference of ministers of environment  economy and social welfare of the Asian and Pacific countries and a pan-European conference on the environment for Europe in 2011.  We would like to express our profound appreciation to the entire international community  the United Nations and its agencies and programmes for the support they rendered to our country in mitigating the consequences of environmental disasters in the Aral Sea and Semipalatinsk regions. Calling for continued active international cooperation  we request support for the draft resolutions to be submitted at the sixty-third session of the General Assembly concerning the problems of the Semipalatinsk region and granting the International Fund to Save the Aral Sea observer status at the General Assembly.  The growing number of natural and man-made disasters makes it necessary to intensify international cooperation as the most effective means of responding to emergencies. Kazakhstan supports cooperation in setting up national and regional platforms  exemplified by the Central Asian Disaster Response Coordination Centre.  We strongly believe that the special needs of landlocked countries should be fully taken into account in accordance with decisions and recommendations based on the Almaty Programme of Action. We hope that the forthcoming midterm review of the Programme will result in the adoption of specific decisions on assistance to this group of countries.  Escalation of ethno-territorial conflicts and increased interfaith tensions indicate that we have reached a critical turning point in our common history. Under these circumstances  Kazakhstan has been consistently and proactively pursuing a policy aimed at ensuring inter-ethnic and interfaith accord  as well as preserving political and social stability in our society. Upon the initiative of our head of State  President Nazarbayev  the Kazakh capital  Astana  hosted two Congresses of Leaders of World and Traditional Religions  in 2003 and 2006. With its next summit meeting to be convened in 2009  this forum has already proved to be an effective international mechanism for promoting peace and tolerance on a global scale.  Kazakhstan is actively involved in the work of the Group of Friends of the Alliance of Civilizations. Our initiative to declare 2010 the International Year of the Rapprochement of Cultures has been supported by all Member States  as reflected in resolution 62/90. We appeal to all countries and organizations of the United Nations to prepare relevant plans for the attainment of the goals of the International Year  in accordance with the provisions of that resolution.  Taking further practical steps to promote dialogue among civilizations  Kazakhstan has proposed the convening of a ministerial conference to be entitled “Common world: Progress through diversity”. Foreign ministers from different regions of the planet have been invited to attend the first meeting of that forum  which is to be held in Astana in October.  As Kazakhstan prepares to assume the duties of Chair of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in 2010 and of the Ministerial Conference of the Organization of the Islamic Conference in 2011  we intend to use this unique opportunity to promote the issues of ensuring greater tolerance and furthering measures by member States against all forms of discrimination as serious items in those organizations.  I would like to conclude my remarks with some ancient oriental wisdom: “Between a man that digs a hole and the man that fills it  there should always be a third man ready to plant a tree”. In today’s world  the United Nations performs that vital function by fostering dialogue and cooperation among all peoples and all States. "
"88",3709,"KEN",63,2008,"I wish first to congratulate Mr. D’Escoto Brockmann on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly.  This session of the General Assembly is taking place at a time of great global challenges  such as the    08-51606 16  energy crisis  high food prices and instability in the financial markets. Those are serious problems that could erode the gains the world economy has made in the past 10 years. Let me add that our gathering here also provides a window of opportunity for us to review the progress we have made  individually and collectively  in fulfilling the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).  Nevertheless  before proceeding with my remarks  I wish first of all to update the Assembly on the progress Kenya has made following the challenges we faced soon after the general elections held in December 2007.  Kenyans  fellow Africans and the international community held on to the hope that our country would obtain a peacefully negotiated outcome to the political crisis. That hope was realized on 28 February with the signing of the National Accord and Reconciliation Act. The Accord paved the way for the establishment of a grand coalition Government representing all major political parties and interests in our country.  The Government is making use of that historic window of opportunity to build a consensus that will enable us to address the major challenges facing our nation. We are  for instance  making good progress towards the implementation of far-reaching legal  constitutional and policy reforms that will entrench national cohesion and meet the political  economic and social aspirations of our people.  I am confident that  over the past few months  Kenya has regained its glory and redeemed its image as a peaceful nation  a safe tourist and investment destination and the regional hub for peace and humanitarian efforts. I wish to express  on behalf of all Kenyans  our profound gratitude for the engagement and support of all our friends. In that connection  I wish to pay special tribute to the members of the Panel of Eminent African Personalities  led by former Secretary-General Kofi Annan  the African Union and the United Nations. I would also like to thank the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  for his personal and constant support.  As Africa grapples with the challenges of competitive elections in fragile democracies divided by regional  racial  religious and ethnic differences  the time has come for us to reflect on the role of competitive electoral processes in the building of our national democratic institutions.  Indeed  the challenge of attaining democratic and inclusive elected Governments is at the core of the conflicts and insecurity prevailing in many parts of Africa. In the Sudan  for example  the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) continues to hold three years after its signing  despite challenges. I welcome the efforts made by the parties to the CPA in overcoming some recent difficulties. I urge them to intensify their efforts to address all outstanding issues in the implementation of the Accord.  On the other hand  the situation in Somalia remains fragile. That is mainly because the Transitional Federal Government of Somalia has still not received full support from the international community.  While I pay tribute to the Governments of Uganda and Burundi for providing troops as part of the African Union Mission in Somalia  I urge the deployment of the remaining troops to strengthen the Mission. I also urge the United Nations and the international community to assume greater responsibility in Somalia so as to nurture the emergence of a stable and democratic country.  With regard to the Great Lakes  tremendous progress has been made in promoting peace while reducing conflict in the region. The conclusion of the Pact on Security  Stability and Development in the Great Lakes Region has given impetus to our efforts. However  the implementation of the Pact faces challenges owing to renewed tension and hostilities. I call upon all those involved to embrace the Pact and to seek the peaceful resolution of current problems. We must not derail our goal of achieving economic development and regional integration in the Great Lakes. The Special Fund for Reconstruction and Development  on which we all agreed  is now operational. I appeal to the international community to contribute to the Fund. It is a crucial pillar for the promotion of peace and development in the Great Lakes region.  I now return to the food crisis  which I mentioned at the beginning of my speech. Our meeting is taking place at a time when Africa and many other parts of the world are facing a severe food shortage. I am therefore happy to note that the theme of this general debate  “The impact of the global food crisis on poverty and hunger in the world as well as the need to democratize the United Nations”  pays particular attention to that important subject. Indeed  while food prices have risen   17 08-51606  globally  their impact has been most severe and adverse for the poorest people living in developing countries. The continued rise in food prices has national security implications for most developing nations.  Therefore  in the immediate future  we must  as Members of the United Nations  find mechanisms to deliver sufficient quantities of affordable food to poor people in Africa and other parts of the developing world. In the medium term  we must also address the issues of agricultural productivity  particularly in terms of making available to smaller farmers in Africa better-yielding seed varieties  modern farming techniques and cheaper fertilizer. That will require more effective global partnerships among developed nations  international institutions and developing nations. In particular  such partnerships should place food security  agricultural technology development and transfer  trade and agricultural credit at the centre of the development agenda.  Indeed  the most equitable way to lift Africa’s people out of poverty and underdevelopment is through the widespread commercialization of agriculture. We must focus on the manufacture of and trade in value-added agricultural products  supported by efficient financial services and markets. In that regard  the global community should hasten consensus on agriculture and other contentious issues  so as to enable the successful conclusion of the Doha Development Round of the World Trade Organization.   On the issue of escalating global oil prices  I wish to make a passionate appeal to oil-producing nations to consider the plight of non-oil-producing nations  especially those in the developing world. There is need to address the problem of speculative trading in the oil futures market  where prices have doubled in the past year. Indeed  the rapid increase in oil prices is hurting developing countries the most and does not augur well for international peace and stability. We should all be aware that we are one global community and that none of us is completely isolated from the instability caused by inflationary pressures resulting from the high oil prices.  We have  over the years  discussed the need for a more effective and accountable United Nations that will enable us to address the emerging and persistent global challenges such as climate change  international security  poverty  conflicts and economic disparities. Towards that end  reform at the Security Council is imperative. We need to ensure that its composition reflects equitable geographical representation of the entire United Nations membership. Africa therefore deserves permanent representation on the Security Council.  Reforms are also needed in other areas. We are convinced that strengthening the Economic and Social Council will enable that organ to reassert its authority and its capacity to promote greater coherence and coordination with the multinational financial institutions  the World Trade Organization and other United Nations bodies.  I would like to congratulate the Secretary-General for his continued focus on the Millennium Development Goals and  in particular  the establishment of the MDGs Africa Steering Group  which has  among other interventions  proposed the launching of an African green revolution. I also look forward to the insights and recommendations that will come out of the High-level Event on MDGs later this week.  Finally  I wish to note that the challenges facing us today  such as the global food crisis  attaining the MDGs and climate change  more than ever before require coordinated global and multilateral cooperation. A more effective and accountable United Nations is therefore needed to meet and overcome these challenges. "
"89",3733,"KGZ",63,2008,"At the outset  I would like to congratulate you  Sir  on your election to the post of President of the General Assembly and wish the work of the sixty-third session every success under your guidance. I should like to express deep gratitude to Srgjan Kerim for successfully steering the work of the Assembly’s previous session.  Today  the role of the United Nations as the universal international forum that can make an important contribution to strengthening international peace and security is seen as increasingly important. The high-level plenary meeting on Africa’s development needs and the high-level event on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) gave us every reason to believe that joint efforts can generate appropriate measures for existing crises and this session of the General Assembly will serve as an additional contribution towards achieving the MDGs.  In today’s conditions  when there are rapid changes worldwide  enhancing the role of the United Nations and the effectiveness of its work is increasingly important. Further strengthening the authority and potential of the Organization in the present situation requires that we pursue reform of the entire United Nations system  so that it can  above all  act as the guarantor of international peace and security and also effectively and flexibly respond to existing problems.  For us  the most important issue is strengthening the Security Council in the cause of preserving international law and order and tranquillity. In advocating expansion of Council membership and  the enhancement of its working methods  the Kyrgyz Republic believes that Council reform must be based on the principles of universality  effectiveness and equitable geographic representation.   For its part  the Kyrgyz Republic will continue to contribute as much as it can to maintaining peace and security. In that regard  we would like to reaffirm that for the first time our country has put forth its candidacy for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council for the term 2012 and 2013. Realizing the true breadth of responsibilities of members in that key body of the United Nations  the Kyrgyz Republic will do its utmost to address global problems.  The rapid changes taking place in the world have not bypassed the Kyrgyz Republic. Such challenges as climate change and the food and energy crises have highlighted the extreme importance of collective efforts  both regional and global. Such circumstances clearly heighten the role of the United Nations and other  regional organizations in consolidating efforts to work out effective mechanisms for preventing and responding to challenges and threats.  As is known  the water resources of Central Asia come from the high alpine glaciers and snowfields in Kyrgyzstan. However  at the beginning of this year we were already encountering the consequences of warming and of a period of water scarcity  which negatively impacted the delivery of electricity to both domestic and external markets. The environmental situation is also aggravated by the fact that in our country earthquakes  landslides and flooding have recurred in recent years and in such conditions the fact that our country has a considerable number of storage sites for radioactive waste poses a serious threat not only to national  but also to regional security.   As international experience demonstrates  peace and security cannot be maintained without establishing the elementary conditions that are necessary for a decent existence. In order to achieve security and development goals simultaneously  the international community must pursue a more balanced policy. Particular attention should consistently be given to issues of law and order in society.  From this rostrum  I would like to thank all United Nations Member countries for their unanimous support for the initiative of the President of the Kyrgyz Republic  Kurmanbek Bakiev  on declaring 20 February as World Day of Social Justice. The pursuit of policies of social justice is aimed at sustainable development of the human potential and at enhancing the interaction of States in order to eradicate poverty  achieve gender balance and to address migration issues.  We are grateful to Member States for their support at the previous Assembly session for resolution 62/196  on sustainable mountain development  under which Bishkek will hold the second Global Mountain Summit in October 2009 to assess the activities of the international community with respect to sustainable mountain development. I take this opportunity to reiterate our invitation to interested countries to take part in that international forum  and also to express the    08-53135 32  hope that Members will provide active support to that initiative of the international community.   I would like to touch upon several issues that are at the centre of attention for the delegation of the Kyrgyz Republic. Most unfortunately  there are still radioactive waste storage sites in the Kyrgyz Republic. Properly maintaining them and preventing a regional environmental disaster stand high on the agenda. We are grateful to the United Nations Development Programme  which has seriously paid attention to the need to solve that problem. I am confident that at the international forum on resolving issues of the storage of uranium tailings  to be held in Bishkek this autumn  the international community  under the United Nations coordinating role  will take effective measures  including financial and technical assistance  aimed at ensuring their security.  We would also like to express firm support for the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Asia  since that would contribute to strengthening global and regional security. In that regard  we hope to receive the broad support of the international community for the related draft resolution at this Assembly session.  In conclusion  I would like to note that the international community is going through a complex period. Member States must reaffirm their readiness to seek practical solutions to the most pressing problems of our time. The international community rightfully expects that we all will work out effective measures to strengthen the United Nations in order to find ways to resolve the challenges of the new millennium. Therefore  we need to do our utmost  so that the current session of the General Assembly will be remembered as a session of reform. "
"90",3776,"KHM",63,2008,"At the outset  I wish to warmly congratulate His Excellency Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann of the Republic of Nicaragua on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session. I can assure him of our fullest cooperation throughout his tenure. I have no doubt that  under his able leadership  we will be successful during this session. I also wish to extend my high appreciation to Mr. Srgjan Kerim of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia  President of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session  for his relentless efforts in guiding us to the many outstanding achievements during the past year.  At present  we have a number of global issues and challenges that we need to address  both collectively and individually  in order to ensure a better world for all of us. Undoubtedly  peace and security remain at the centre of our preoccupation that obliges us to take responsibility first and foremost. Terrorism is a stumbling block to the advancement and prosperity of our societies and the world at large. We need to recommit ourselves and strengthen our practical measures  including putting in place a good strategy to combat terrorism at the national  regional and international levels. We must enhance at all levels the relevant existing instruments on counter-terrorism  in particular the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy  which was adopted by the General Assembly in December 2006.  As for Cambodia  the Royal Government has devoted its time  energy  efforts and resources to join the international community in combating terrorism in accordance with the United Nations conventions  protocols and agreements on security cooperation with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations member States  including its partners in the region. To live up to our strong commitment  the Law on Counter-terrorism was promulgated by His Majesty the King of Cambodia in July 2007  and our national mechanism in that area has been constantly strengthened.  Furthermore  our world is still marred by the spread of small arms and light weapons  which continue to have implications for our comprehensive security and livelihoods. We need to address that issue with seriousness and prompt actions. As a country that was ravaged by war and conflict for more than two decades  Cambodia experienced suffering from the use of small arms and light weapons and other weapons of war. In that regard  we attach great importance to the agreed international instruments  especially the implementation of the 2001 United Nations Programme of Action to Prevent  Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects. Over the years  Cambodia has taken practical measures to strictly control the use and circulation of arms and ammunitions  as well as to eliminate the illegal procurement and sale of arms.  On the issue of landmines and unexploded ammunition  we are of the view that landmines are not only a security problem  but also a humanitarian one  as their innocent victims become permanently traumatized and physically handicapped  while their    08-53141 20  families suffer untold misery of spiritual and material deprivation.  The problems of landmines and unexploded ordnance have been integrated into our national agenda — such as the Cambodia millennium development goals  the National Strategic Development Plan and the Rectangular Strategy of the Royal Government of Cambodia — in order to cope with that challenging issue. Cambodia highly appreciates the valuable contributions of development partners and donors in terms of financial and material support over the years.  With our demining experience and as part of our contribution to international peace  security and development  Cambodia has dispatched its third group of 135 deminers of the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces to the Sudan for mine clearance activities under the umbrella of the United Nations peacekeeping operations.  We are now confronted more than ever with increasing natural disasters  from floods to droughts  from tsunamis to storms and global warming  to name just a few that are caused mostly by climate change.  Nowadays  industrialized countries consume 75 per cent of the world’s energy and produce 80 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions  while developing countries  which produce little of such gas and have essentially agricultural economies  are the main victims of increasing global warming and continuing climate change.  According to a report of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  if the temperature increases by two degrees Celsius  up to 30 per cent of plant and animal species worldwide would be at risk of extinction. However  according to a separate study of the Climate Change Policy Unit of the World Wildlife Fund  it would take only 0.1 per cent of global gross domestic product to save the world’s climate  and thus our own human survival.  Fully aware of the danger and consequences of climate change and global warming on the well-being  livelihood  and development of people around the world  Cambodia has led a vast campaign of reforestation throughout our country  where 14 300 hectares were planted between 2003 and 2006. The rationalization and ban of wood-cutting have been implemented. As a party to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and its Kyoto Protocol  Cambodia has made its utmost effort to implement the Convention and the Protocol  promote clean development mechanism projects  and to prepare a national adaptation programme of action on climate change. Cambodia also strongly supports the Bali Action Plan aimed at greenhouse gas reduction as well as the Japanese initiative Cool Earth 50.  We are also of the view that  to help reverse climate change  we will need to preserve nature’s biodiversity as much as possible and to put an end to the ongoing deforestation in the world  especially in the least developed countries  by assisting people in finding sources of income other than deforestation.  It is also important for us to actively promote world public participation in the issue by mobilizing public awareness of the absolute necessity to work together to struggle against global warming and climate change. We should forge a shared awareness of climate change caused by industrialization  which is the other side of the coin of development. We need to mobilize the support of all countries  especially the industrialized developed nations  to respect and implement the Framework Convention and its Kyoto Protocol.  I would like to take this opportunity to call on the United Nations to organize a world summit on climate change so that the issue will remain at the top of world leaders’ agendas and to ensure that concrete and timely measures and action will be undertaken to help reverse the current trend of global warming and climate change.  Concerning the Korean peninsula  we are confident that the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and the United States  as well as other parties involved  will maintain the momentum in fulfilling  in good faith  the implementation of the 2005 Joint Statement for the sake of peace  stability and security in the region and the world at large.  Regarding the Middle East  the peace process has been on our agenda for long enough and we are hopeful that all parties to the conflict will have the will and the wisdom to end the conflict as soon as possible in the interests of all countries concerned. In that regard  Cambodia welcomes the 24 June 2008 Quartet statement and the ongoing negotiations between Israel and Palestine to bring about peace. Israel and Palestine must seize this opportunity to use every potential for achieving an agreement acceptable to both sides.   21 08-53141   With regard to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  eight years have gone by since their adoption. We all know that the pace of achieving progress towards the MDGs is very slow and that we risk the possibility of missing the 2015 target date. The outcomes of the high-level meeting on the Millennium Development Goals have clearly underlined the importance for the need to continue implementing the MDGs with greater effectiveness by enhancing closer cooperation between developed and developing countries.  In that regard  there is a need to ensure greater flows of financing for development through foreign direct investment  official development assistance and more trade. At the same time  developed countries should make greater efforts to transfer innovative and relevant technology to developing countries.  For its part  Cambodia is firmly dedicated to achieving the MDGs. Various strategies for sustainable development and poverty alleviation are in the early stages of elaboration. The eight United Nations Goals have been incorporated into the framework of our National Strategic Development Plan  the Cambodian millennium development goals and the Rectangular Strategy. Over the years  with those development blueprints Cambodia experienced a double-digit economic growth of 11.1 per cent on average from 2004 through 2007 and the poverty rate dropped from 35 per cent to 31 per cent.  In addition  Cambodia is fully committed to implementing the principle of good governance and maintaining macroeconomic stability and fiscal discipline. The policy of the Royal Government of Cambodia is to conserve its domestic resources in order to finance the needs of national development.  However  domestic resources are not enough to finance investment needs for maintaining the economic growth rate at an acceptable level and as a response to key socio-economic targets  including the MDGs. Therefore  Cambodia continues to need financial cooperation from its development partners in order to support ongoing national development and poverty reduction.  For years  we have all agreed that the United Nations needs reform. Despite our concerted efforts and some progress  differences remain on how to make the United Nations more effective and more relevant in dealing with the numerous challenges we face today throughout the world. Cambodia is of the view that United Nations reform must be comprehensive and realistic. In order to move forward  we should continue to build greater consensus and uphold the common interests of all  without discrimination.  For almost 15 years now  Member States have intensely deliberated Security Council reform. Cambodia has consistently reiterated its position in support of the expansion of the permanent and non-permanent membership of the Security Council.  However  we have not yet achieved any acceptable modality and clear framework for the reform. Therefore  Security Council reform has remained deadlocked. Although we have agreed that the status quo is not acceptable  we must not lose the momentum. In addition  we need to redouble our collective efforts to ensure a breakthrough in the current impasse of Security Council reform. "
"91",3790,"KIR",63,2008,"I bring warm greetings from the Government and the people of the Republic of Kiribati  on whose behalf I am honoured to address this body this morning. Let me  at the outset  congratulate Mr. D’Escoto Brockmann on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session. I am confident that he will provide efficient and effective leadership in guiding this session towards a productive and concrete outcome for all. I would also like to thank his predecessor for his able and effective leadership during the past session. I should also like to acknowledge the election of Solomon Islands as a Vice-President of the General Assembly at this session. We are indeed very proud to have a Pacific brother in that position.  Every year  we come together as citizens of the international community to reflect on and discuss possible solutions to the daunting challenges that continue to face us individually and collectively. Climate change and sea level rise  environmental protection  food and fuel price increases and achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) are among the challenges that I wish to focus on  in the interests of time and brevity.  For many years  we have tirelessly appealed to the Organization to do something about climate change and to provide solutions for those seriously affected by its detrimental impact  especially those whose very existence is being threatened. Those appeals have failed to produce practical solutions for people living in low-lying small island developing States like Kiribati. While the members of the international community continue to point fingers at each other regarding responsibility for and leadership on that issue  our people continue to experience the impact of climate change and sea-level rise and practical solutions continue to elude us.  The science on climate change is irrefutable. The fourth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projected an increase in sea level of 0.4 metres within this century. While that may sound minimal to most  it is quite alarming for low-lying small island developing States like Kiribati  whose elevation is no more than two metres above sea level and whose main source of water is underground aquifers. Before our islands are inundated by the rising sea  saltwater intrusion into our freshwater lens will render the islands uninhabitable. With the projected sea-level rise  Kiribati could be looking at 50 to 60 years before that happens. Presented with those findings  we have had to adopt a pragmatic approach and to formulate options for our people. We do so with a great deal of regret and a deep sense of frustration.  Mitigation and adaptation strategies are and will continue to be integral components of our response to climate change. It would indeed be naive to suggest otherwise. Those strategies provide only short- and medium-term solutions. Ultimately  low-lying island countries like Kiribati will have to face up to the reality of their islands being unable to support life and to plan accordingly beyond existing adaptation strategies.   Kiribati is not a major emitter of greenhouse gases. Its mitigation efforts would therefore have an insignificant impact on the global climate change situation. Nevertheless  we will do our part and explore appropriate renewable and efficient energy technologies  as well as promote replanting in our islands.  While we also require adaptation strategies  our adaptation options are extremely limited  particularly given the nature of our islands. We are a country of low-lying coral atolls  with most islands rising no more than two metres above sea level. Coastal protection through seawall construction is the main adaptation measure currently being undertaken by the Government  but it is limited to the protection of public infrastructure. We simply do not have the resources to extend protection to private properties and assets. Adaptation measures  such as moving inland and to higher ground  are impractical for us. We cannot move further inland due to the narrowness of our islands  nor is there any higher ground to which we can escape from the rising seas.  It is encouraging indeed to follow the emergence of many climate change initiatives. It gives us hope to see that humankind is beginning to do the right thing. We have been following developments on those fronts. I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge Australia’s commitment to the Kyoto Protocol and its    08-51845 20  recent announcement of its climate change programme. New Zealand has also announced its pledge to increase financial support for climate change. We also welcome Japan’s Cool Earth Promotion Programme and the European Union’s Global Climate Change Alliance  which support practical measures to address the impacts of climate change in the Pacific island countries.  The report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change also states that the concentration of greenhouse gases already in the atmosphere will continue the momentum of climate change  regardless of any substantial reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and mitigation efforts. That effectively means that low-lying small island developing countries like Kiribati are on the frontlines of the climate change calamity. Mitigation efforts therefore will not be able to reverse our situation — a situation that we have recently acknowledged and to which my Government has provided a long-term strategy for our people’s future and survival.  At the previous session of the Assembly  a question was raised regarding what we are to do when people start fleeing their countries  not because of political persecution but because of environmental catastrophe. That is the question that I want to put forward as a challenge to this session  and to which I wish to provide a possible answer  at least from the perspective of a country whose very existence is under serious threat. The relocation of the 100 000 people of Kiribati  for example  is not something that can be done overnight. It requires long-term forward planning. The sooner we act  the less stressful and the less painful it will be for all concerned.  That is why my Government has developed a long-term merit-based relocation strategy as an option for our people. As leaders  it is indeed our duty to the people we serve to prepare them for the worst-case scenario. The strategy involves upgrading the skills of our people to make them competitive and marketable in international labour markets. We want to target labour markets where skills or labour gaps exist and provide labour for them. We believe that offers a win-win situation for all. We will be able to provide countries with labour and those countries will be able to provide potential new homes for our people. The strategy provides our people with an option so that when they choose to migrate  they will migrate on merit and with dignity. We hope that they will be received by their adoptive countries not as burdens or refugees  but as worthwhile members of the community with something to contribute.  We have already started implementing that strategy and we are indeed encouraged by  and grateful for  the support for that approach among our regional partners in the Pacific. Under its Pacific Access Category Scheme  New Zealand randomly picks a certain number of people from certain Pacific island countries  including Kiribati  to migrate to New Zealand every year. Recently  Australia launched the Australia Pacific Technical College  which aims at training Pacific people with Australian standard qualifications that will allow them to access regional and international labour markets. The bilateral Kiribati-Australia Nursing Initiative is another example of a programme that supports that long-term strategy. We welcome them all indeed.  At the regional level  in August  the leaders of the Pacific Islands Forum adopted the Niue Declaration on Climate Change. That is a reflection of our concerted regional efforts to respond to the adverse impacts of climate change  which have been severely felt across our region. As the first-ever high-level climate document in our part of the world  the Declaration is indeed a milestone. It calls for collective efforts to fight the growing threat posed by climate change to many aspects of our lives and to our future as nations.  At the international level  we have been following closely the issues currently taking precedence on the United Nations agenda. It is indeed most gratifying to note that climate change is finally being given due recognition as a security issue. We welcome that development  as we believe that it is time the United Nations focused its attention on the human dimension of climate change. Discussions about carbon trading  the post-Kyoto Protocol era and even concerns over the future of polar bears have been  or are being  held. We welcome those discussions but  at the same time  we wish to express our deep concern that there has never been any discussion of the fate of humans  whose very existence is being seriously undermined by climate change.   That is the challenge that I propose that this body  the President and the Secretary-General address during this session. In that connection  I commend to the Assembly the draft resolution on climate change as a security issue and a threat to international peace and   21 08-51845  security. My colleagues from the Pacific have already alluded to it  and I commend them for their support. I also wish to applaud the excellent efforts by our Pacific ambassadors in New York  as well as their leadership on the draft resolution. I am also grateful to those who have supported the draft resolution so far  as well as those who we hope will do so in the future. We in the Pacific have been strong supporters of the fight against terrorism. We now turn to those with whom we have partnered in the fight against terrorism to partner with us in our fight against climate change.  Kiribati is proud to be home to the Phoenix Islands Protected Area  the largest marine protected area in the world. That was the result of a collaborative effort and partnership between Kiribati  the New England Aquarium and Conservation International. The Phoenix Islands Protected Area covers an area of around 410 500 square kilometres  making it  for now  the planet’s largest marine protected area. The Area covers over 11 per cent of our extensive exclusive economic zone of over 3 million square kilometres  while the land comprising the Area is over 3.5 per cent of the total land mass of Kiribati.  The Phoenix Islands are some of the most isolated islands on Earth and are largely untouched by man. In 2002  the countries of the world made a commitment to significantly reduce the current rate of biodiversity loss by 2010. Our declaration of the Area is in part a contribution towards meeting that target  as well as a statement by which we are saying that sacrifices must and can be made.   The preservation of those islands and the surrounding ocean is our gift to humankind  of which we are a part. Even now  as we confront the possibility that our islands will become uninhabitable within the century due to the rising sea levels  we recognize the value of protecting something that we believe to be the common heritage of us all. I take this opportunity to acknowledge the invaluable support and contribution of the New England Aquarium and Conservation International  our partners in this endeavour. We invite Governments  intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations  members of the private sector and individuals to join us in this worthwhile and ambitious initiative.  The recent hike in food and fuel prices is being felt by all  but more acutely by those living in drought-prone  resource-poor and infertile small island developing States like Kiribati  who as a consequence depend highly on imported food. Our isolation from major markets means that the cost of transporting food items to our country is becoming more and more expensive. In addition  the cost of providing basic services to our people  who live on widely scattered islands  is also becoming a real challenge for all of us in similar situations.  We acknowledge the ability of certain members of the Organization to address this global challenge. We appeal to them to assist the most vulnerable members  such as Kiribati  with their food and energy security strategies. In that regard  we acknowledge with appreciation the assistance provided to our energy security strategy by our development partners  including Japan and Korea.  With regard to graduation from the list of least developed countries  the Committee for Development Policy will meet early next year to prepare the 2009 review of countries that are deemed eligible to graduate under the methodology and indicators of the United Nations. Kiribati is one of three least developed countries of the Pacific — the others being Tuvalu and Vanuatu — being considered for graduation. We believe there are pertinent issues that warrant proper consideration by the United Nations with regard to this process.   One is the issue of the extreme economic vulnerability of small island developing States. Current indicators focus on improved performance on per capita income and human assets. Due consideration should be accorded to the special economic vulnerability to external shocks such as rising world food and fuel prices.   While it is not currently a graduation indicator  we believe that environmental vulnerability should be taken into account when considering the cases of small island developing States such as Kiribati  Tuvalu and Vanuatu  which are among the most vulnerable to the impact of climate change and extreme weather events — which  in turn  pose major challenges to their sustainable development efforts.  In that connection  I wish to commend my Pacific colleagues who have advocated the need to reform the application of the rule of graduation. We reiterate that call and urge the United Nations to reconsider the graduation rule in the light of the special economic    08-51845 22  situation and the vulnerability of those island nations to climate change and external shocks.  On the Millennium Development Goals  many of my fellow members will be familiar with  and share  the genuine desire to promote the development aspirations of our peoples  which is our priority. Even with our limited capacity  we are committed to the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals. In that regard  I am pleased to report that Kiribati has launched its first report on the Millennium Development Goals.  The report outlines weaknesses and strengths in the overall development efforts and in meeting the MDGs. We believe that we are on track with our progress on most of the Goals  but we also admit that we are behind on some of them. The main reason for that is the lack of data to measure our progress so far and our limited resources to implement strategies aimed at achieving the Goals. We will continue to exert efforts in meeting the targeted Goals by 2015. At this time  I wish to express our deep appreciation to our development partners  who have accompanied us on this journey and have contributed meaningfully to the realization of our development aspirations.  While we commend the United Nations for the many initiatives put forward in addressing the needs of its Members  it is regrettable that it has continued to deny the 23 million people of Taiwan equal rights as international citizens to participate fully in world affairs. We believe that Taiwan has made an active contribution that has enriched the lives of many in their collaborative efforts in building and securing international peace and security. We believe that the people of Taiwan should be accorded the same fundamental right to participate as fellow citizens of the international community and to be allowed to contribute meaningfully in various sectors of the Organization’s activities.  The challenges that we face are global in nature  and therefore require global solutions. We call upon the United Nations to take the lead in addressing those challenges  especially in funding  supporting and facilitating the implementation of practical solutions to the security challenges that threaten the very existence of peoples and nations  which in turn poses a threat to international peace and security."
"92",3821,"KNA",63,2008,"I wish to begin by thanking His Excellency Srgjan Kerim for his leadership over the past year as President of this august and venerable body at its sixty-second session. I also wish to congratulate and extend best wishes to His Excellency Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann of Nicaragua on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session.  Twenty-five years ago almost to the day  two Caribbean peoples who had always been separated by water but had long been united by history  culture and circumstance joined forces to embark upon a bold experiment. Having between them a land mass of just over 100 square miles and a population of approximately 50 000  the people of Saint Kitts and the people of Nevis decided to step forward as one nation to join the world community of sovereign States.  It is an honour and a pleasure for me to be here to represent that nation at the United Nations  a potent symbol of freedom and sovereignty. That symbolism means all the more to my people at this particular time  as this sixty-third session of the General Assembly coincides with the celebration of my nation’s twenty-fifth anniversary of political independence.  Building and reinforcing the pillars of nationhood has not been easy  but we have always considered it an essential task and a challenge worth facing. Therefore  as chief servant of my people and my cherished land  I stand before the Assembly today  emboldened by the pride of a nation that has taken its full and rightful place among the community of independent nations  a vibrant democracy with a thriving economy  a deep commitment to justice and human rights  and an abiding faith in social equity.  Mine is a pride that comes not only from realizing the benefits of the practical policies and programmes created over the years to improve the standard of living and uplift our people  but also from the sense of community  partnership and civic and personal responsibility that have shaped the destiny of my proud nation.  It is also the pride that comes from witnessing first-hand the true value of freedom — a freedom that has enabled us to share in the triumphs of democracy and to mould the creative genius and the industrious  enterprising spirit of our people into a single community of goodwill and commitment that moves our people and great country forward.  It is a pride borne of weathering storms of external economic shocks  including fluctuating commodity prices and the withdrawal of preferential market access  while being able to successfully   47 08-51851  transform three centuries of a monocultural  sugar-based economy into a vibrant and competitive services-driven economy. Many other small States have not been as fortunate  however.  That is evident in our sister Caribbean nation of Haiti  where the devastating effects of four consecutive hurricanes in the space of one month continue to undermine the Government’s effort to build strong institutions and to invest in the productive enterprises and infrastructure that generate employment and improved living conditions.  The progress witnessed in Saint Kitts and Nevis was not achieved by chance. Since the birth of our nation 25 years ago  we have faced a multitude of problems  some of which are fortunately behind us  but several others of which have emerged and grown in intensity and scope.  However  our experience in Saint Kitts and Nevis demonstrates that good governance and prudent management of one’s resources; appropriate investment in people and systems; the protection people’s freedom of association  religion and speech; the support and facilitation of a free and vibrant press; success at advancing the socio-economic well-being of one’s people; and the upholding of democratic ideals are determined not by land mass  but by national character and political commitment. They are the result not of demographics or geographic size  but of long-standing sociocultural traditions. They are a function not of gross domestic product  but of an entrenched ethos of striving and determination. Our faith has steadied our resolve and belief in ourselves and our future. Of course  along the way  we have relied  understandably on such institutions as our beloved United Nations.  Through membership  Saint Kitts and Nevis has built important and strategic partnerships  stood shoulder to shoulder with other Member States to protect our individual rights and collective freedoms  and have fought battles far bigger than would be expected for a country of its size. We have also been witnesses to the positives and negatives  the strengths and failings of our world  but have soldiered on together in common cause.  That is why  25 years later  I remain optimistic about the progress of the United Nations and its ability to defend the poor and needy despite the pull of competing powerful national agendas that have occasionally threatened to undermine the ethos of the institution and  indeed  the common good. From where I stand today  I have come to appreciate those achievements and to appreciate that  even at this juncture  providence affords us still new opportunities to renew our cherished institution.  It is very easy to side with the cynics when the Security Council becomes frozen in stalemate or when the need for action falls victim to political posturing. But history  particularly that of the past two decades  instructs me that the United Nations is far more than the sum of its weaknesses  because for millions of people around the world this Organization is their only hope  a bridge between life and death  a bastion of freedom and a beacon of hope.  It is my hope  therefore  that in this “Assembly of frankness” there will be a sober and unrelenting analysis of the human consequences of sweeping and globally enforced trade and economic regimes on small States all around the globe. And it is also my hope that the economic uncertainties now being experienced in some of the world’s larger economies will sensitize us all to the breadth of the uncertainty  the depth of the anxiety and the real psychological trauma that often grip small States when policies that are formulated far beyond their shores and are utterly unresponsive to their entreaties are nonetheless thrust unflinchingly upon them.  Recent events have brought into focus the issue of the stability of the world’s financial systems and financial institutions. The circumstances that have led to collapsing financial institutions and rising prices for food and energy were not created by small States such as Saint Kitts and Nevis. But yet again  as in the case of climate change  we are victims of the act of others  but with no resources whatsoever to combat the consequences.  Earlier this year  I participated in the High-level Conference on World Food Security  held in June in Rome. The upbeat response from several heads of State or Government and from the numerous ministers of agriculture  forestry  fisheries  water  energy and environment who participated in that meeting was  for me  a strong indication of the relevance and timeliness of the Conference for nations seeking to take positive action on the issue of food security.  The current trend continues to have a lopsided impact on the poor and on the increasing numbers of extremely poor and vulnerable people  who are those    08-51851 48  least able to counter the impact of economic dislocations facing our countries. Mindful of our personal responsibility as leaders and of the heightened expectations of our citizens  the Government of Saint Kitts and Nevis has been taking practical measures to alleviate the suffering of our resilient people. We have addressed the important dimensions of availability and access to certain food staples such as rice  flour and sugar. We have looked at how best to stabilize prices to inject predictability into the system without prejudice to free market economics. We have also begun to rationalize and promote proper utilization of agricultural lands through land use diversion and diversification  providing financial and seedling support to farmers and recommending water rationalization and enhanced irrigation techniques.  The problems to which I have alluded are not unique to Saint Kitts and Nevis. Members will recall popular riots in some countries  including in Haiti  where they led to the resignation of that country’s Government. That is evidence of just how the impact of the rising cost of food and the despair visited upon whole communities could easily undermine peoples’ faith in their Governments to deliver on the promises of democracy  free market economics and globalization.  It was in January 2008 that the food price index established by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) jumped by 47 per cent over the previous year. This included increases for cereals by some 62 per cent  dairy products by 69 per cent and vegetable oils by 85 per cent. In some instances  prices of staple foods such as maize  wheat  rice and beans have risen by more than 100 per cent. This global economic downturn  coupled with the dramatic upsurge in commodity prices  has created the worst food crisis in recent years.  This new phenomenon will make it much more difficult for us to address the growing incidence of poverty in and among our nations and our ability to achieve the Millennium Development Goal of halving extreme poverty and hunger throughout the world by 2015.  Against this backdrop  and given the need for urgent action  we also urge that the issue of reform  a recurrent United Nations theme for some 15 years  be revisited with renewed vigour and commitment. Far too much time has passed. Far too little has been done. And far too much now hangs in the balance. Let us equip the United Nations with the tools necessary to fulfil its mandates  especially in the areas of protecting individual freedoms and human rights and of promoting economic development as an integral element of human security around the world. For as Clarence Darrow said  “You can only protect your liberties in the world by protecting the other man’s freedom. You can only be free if I am free”.  The continuous suppression of freedom — overt or disguised — under the cloak of civil order or territorial integrity  must be tackled openly. Freedom and personal responsibility go hand in hand. How can we encourage people to take personal responsibility but deprive them of their personal freedom? That is the fundamental question.  Our presence here today is both a demonstration and an acknowledgement of the increasingly interconnected nature of our world. I wish to say that much of what Saint Kitts and Nevis has achieved over the past 25 years has been the result of our people’s hard work and discipline  combined with the benefits that have accrued from both our multilateral and our bilateral relations. In that regard  the United Nations Development Programme has been a vibrant partner in advancing the programmatic goals of our twin-island federation  as have UNESCO and other United Nations agencies. Our relationship with this Organization is one that we cherish dearly.   We have worked with and through subregional entities such as the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States  regional mechanisms such as the Caribbean Community and hemispheric institutions such as the Organization of American States. Through regional mechanisms we have been able to map a course for functional cooperation on issues such as trade  security and health. Within the Pan-Caribbean Partnership against HIV/AIDS  we have developed a regional response to tackle the epidemic of HIV/AIDS. In the area of environmental protection  we continue to collaborate on and to work towards disaster reduction and mitigation. And we are assiduously exploring renewable energy sources  including geothermal energy  on which we have made encouraging progress.  On the issue of bilateral relations  I am pleased to say that we have built many deeply valued relationships over the years  and we continue to further strengthen those relations. In the light of that  we urge   49 08-51851  that a way be found to facilitate the participation of the Republic of China on Taiwan in the specialized agencies of the United Nations. As world challenges have expanded  the Republic of China on Taiwan has stepped forward to provide technical assistance in the areas of social and agricultural development  as well as disaster relief in many countries  thus bringing enormous benefits to both public and private sectors.  Whatever the tone and tenor of the ongoing debate  climate change is an aspect of our modern experience. Because of our activities and our assault on Earth’s atmosphere  many processes have negatively impacted rivers  lakes and oceans  resulting in fast-melting polar ice caps and rising sea levels and exposing us to greater risks of harmful solar radiation and greenhouse gas emissions. Wherever culpability may reside  those processes all have serious implications and consequences for small island States. In varying degrees and at various levels  those changes impact hundreds of thousands of small-scale farmers  fishermen and other people who depend heavily on the natural environment for their livelihood but are already witnessing lower crop yields and smaller catches.  It is no longer sufficient simply to lay blame at the feet of countries  businesses and people who pollute. We need effective strategies based on scientific consensus and  of course  solution-focused approaches that address such issues as the suitability of land for various types of crops  dedicated areas for livestock  pasture development  the marine environment  impact on health and health care  the productivity of forests and the increased incidence of pests and diseases  as well as implications for biodiversity and ecosystems. We must collaborate in addressing those effects  and we must take necessary corrective action in order to build a safer environment for ourselves and our future generations.  Our destinies and our freedoms are all interwoven. It was Franklin D. Roosevelt who said that “true individual freedom cannot exist without economic security and independence”. As Saint Kitts and Nevis commemorates its silver-jubilee year of independence  we therefore feel compelled to call on the United Nations and the members of the Security Council to work together to put an end to the genocide in parts of Africa. I also call on the United Nations to take firm action in the lead-up to the Follow-up International Conference on Financing for Development so that that event will bring real relief and development  even to the far corners of Africa.  For much too long we have  perhaps unwittingly  separated human security from representative democracy and economic development from human rights. Those are inextricably linked. When we fight for the freedom of our brothers to vote but ignore their inalienable right to food security  that is a skewed principle; it is a half-measure based on a selective morality in which our fight will always be only partially won.  We cannot simply tell our citizens that they are free to vote  while failing to help them transform freedoms into practical systems that support and advance personal dreams. Democracy  I emphasize  is the best vehicle through which humankind can realize its dreams and aspirations. I firmly believe that true independence  like freedom  can come only from doing what is right.  And so I continue to believe in the United Nations  but beyond that  I have faith — an abiding faith — in the people of Saint Kitts and Nevis  whose confidence in themselves as a nation and whose commitment to the future have made possible the successes  positive growth and development that they have achieved  as well as the international partnerships that they have established  over the past 25 years.  Therefore  I say to the States Members of the United Nations: Let us commit to doing the right things. Let us continue the important work to reform and revitalize the United Nations. Let us tackle food security by recognizing that globalization was meant to improve our lives  not to worsen them. Globalization was meant to facilitate the free movement of goods and services  not to provide an opportunity for erecting artificial and unilateral barriers that punish poor and less competitive countries. Let us do the right thing about climate change. And together  one step at a time  let us do the right thing by using the Follow-up International Conference on Financing for Development to address the fundamental development challenges facing developing countries in Africa and throughout the world. All that and far more is within the power and the capacity of a reordered United Nations and of Member States that are willing to take personal responsibility in that regard. "
"93",3847,"KOR",63,2008,"I would like to extend my congratulations to His Excellency Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session. I also wish to express my deep appreciation to His Excellency Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his dedication to having the United Nations meet global challenges in a more effective and timely manner. I assure them of the Republic of Korea’s full support for their noble endeavours.  As I stand here  I recall those turbulent days seven years ago when we stood shaken by the terrorist acts in the morning of 11 September 2001. Throughout my presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth session  all Member States were united in dealing with the grave challenges in the shadow of 9/11.  On 12 September 2001  this Assembly began its fifty-sixth session by adopting resolution 56/1  strongly condemning the terrorist acts and calling for a concerted effort by the international community to combat terrorism. With the close cooperation that followed  counter-terrorist capacity has been strengthened at all levels.  Nevertheless  as we are witnessing in many parts of the world today  terrorism continues to threaten and take the lives of innocent people. As the international community shares the concern over such an intractable trend  it is time for us to renew our commitment to completely root out terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.  This year marks the sixtieth anniversary of the founding of the Republic of Korea. The Republic of Korea was the first country to have the establishment of its Government recognized by the United Nations    08-51851 32  through a General Assembly resolution  back in December 1948. Thanks to the Assembly’s continuous support  the Republic of Korea was able to step into the twenty-first century as a full-fledged democracy and vibrant economy. It is my sincere hope that this special relationship will further develop and strengthen in the years to come.  Over the past six decades  the United Nations has strived for the common good of the international community and has become ever more relevant to the well-being of the present and future generations of humankind. It is currently leading the global efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and is demonstrating strong stewardship in addressing the global food and energy crises  as well as climate change.  Standing at the midpoint to the MDG target year of 2015  we realize that  in order to achieve what we pledged  all Member States will have to redouble their commitments to the MDGs. But political commitment alone is not enough. We need solid economic growth and a coherent strategy to translate our commitment into reality.  While the rapid growth experiences of Korea and other countries have served as a useful reference for many developing countries  we should move beyond the conventional economic growth approach of “grow first  clean up later”. Rather  what we need is green and pro-poor growth.  Climate change  on which the future of humanity so critically depends  is now looming larger than ever as a global challenge. Adverse impacts of climate change are threatening the very foundation of the MDGs  inter alia  by affecting agriculture  upon which the livelihood of many in the developing world depends  and by increasing climate-related natural disasters  which are hitting hard the most vulnerable bottom billion  as in the case of Typhoon Nargis.  The conventional growth approach based on cheap fossil fuel is among the factors driving up the prices of oil and food. As such  we need a new climate-friendly strategy for energy and development if we are to attain the goals of the MDGs while addressing climate change. I encourage all agencies of the United Nations to closely cooperate to develop a new road map. In that regard  I would like to express my full support for the energetic leadership of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon  who has been working hard to place climate change as our top priority on the global agenda.  The Republic of Korea recently embraced a low-carbon  green growth paradigm. We strongly believe that that is and should be the new paradigm for growth and development of the world in the future. We support the global vision of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 50 per cent by 2050 and plan to announce next year our voluntary midterm mitigation goal set for the year 2020. We will also launch the East Asia Climate Partnership  which will initiate programmes in the amount of $200 million over the next five years to support other countries in making their economic growth compatible with climate change concerns.  In 2002  I attended the World Summit on Sustainable Development  held in Johannesburg  in my capacity as President of the General Assembly. Through that and other experiences  I have come to firmly believe in the importance of high-level commitments to strengthening our efforts and political momentum on issues concerning the environment and development. In that vein  I would like to emphasize that a new world summit focusing on climate change and sustainable development needs to be held in 2012  not least to ensure a strong take-off for a post-2012 climate regime.  Given that the past three conferences were held in Europe  America and Africa respectively  it could well be Asia’s turn to host the next. Asia is the most populous region in the world and is undergoing vibrant economic transformation  which makes the sustainable development issue all the more relevant. As a country well-placed to play a bridging role between developed and developing nations  the Republic of Korea hopes to make a contribution by hosting that conference.  The global food crisis is another factor contributing to instability by increasing the population affected by poverty and starvation. It is also threatening to reverse many of the gains we have achieved thus far in the development field. As the causes behind the current food crisis are complex and varied  our responses must be comprehensive as well as timely.  The Republic of Korea has provided humanitarian assistance to countries facing food crises. I am pleased to inform the Assembly that the Republic of Korea  in addition to its assistance to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea  has decided to offer   33 08-51851  $100 million over the next three years for emergency food aid and for assistance to strengthen the agricultural capacities of developing countries. With first-hand knowledge in agricultural development  Korea plans to assist in various areas  including farming infrastructure  technology and policymaking.  This year also marks the sixtieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Over the decades  the United Nations has played an indispensable role in setting international norms and principles to ensure all human rights for all. This year saw further progress  with the implementation of the Universal Periodic Review by the Human Rights Council and with the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities taking effect. At the same time  we need to redouble efforts to stem the serious human rights violations that still continue in certain regions. The Republic of Korea urges those human rights violators to urgently respond to the international community’s call for dialogue and cooperation and to follow up with appropriate measures to enhance human rights.  In the area of United Nations reform  it is more crucial now than ever that the United Nations operate efficiently  effectively and responsively. The Republic of Korea supports all efforts  in particular the initiatives taken by the Secretary-General  to make the Secretariat more accountable  efficient and responsive.  As for the Security Council  in order for it to better fulfil its mandate of maintaining international peace and security  it needs to be reformed to ensure that it is more representative  accountable and efficient. Moreover  considering the importance of the Security Council  every effort should be made to acquire a general agreement among all Member States in steering the direction of the reform. It should be not an issue of division  but one that unites Member States.  The new Government of the Republic of Korea has posited contributing to the international community as a trusted partner as one of the pillars of its foreign policy. To that end  we are strengthening our role in official development assistance and peacekeeping operations.  Since 2000  our official development assistance has increased three times in volume  with assistance to Africa increasing threefold in the past three years. We plan to triple our current official development assistance to reach over $3 billion by 2015. To better coordinate our development cooperation policy with the international community  the Republic of Korea plans to join the Development Assistance Committee of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in 2010.   The Republic of Korea is also seeking ways to strengthen its participation in United Nations peacekeeping operations. Currently  we have a 350-strong contingent dispatched to the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon and are considering legislation to facilitate our participation in peacekeeping operations.  The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems poses a grave threat to international peace and security. We must strengthen the disarmament and non-proliferation regimes  including the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). In that regard  it is crucial that the North Korean nuclear issue be expeditiously resolved. That issue has remained for many years a threat to the security of North-East Asia while seriously undermining the very foundations of the NPT regime.  The Republic of Korea is making every effort to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue within the framework of the Six-Party Talks  under which some progress has been made. However  Pyongyang’s recent move to suspend the disablement measures and attempt to reverse the process is highly regrettable. We urge the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to resume disablement measures immediately so that the positive momentum generated by the Six-Party Talks process can be maintained and the denuclearization process can move forward.  With a view to developing more mature inter-Korean relations in a pragmatic and productive way  the Republic of Korea pursues a policy of mutual benefits and common prosperity. As progress is made in denuclearization  we stand ready to support economic development in the North. We are also willing to hold discussions with Pyongyang on how to implement properly all past inter-Korean agreements  including the Basic Agreement of 1992. President Lee Myung-bak  in his speech to the National Assembly in July  proposed to fully restore inter-Korean dialogue and emphasized that we are ready to render our cooperation to alleviate the food crisis in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. We look    08-51851 34  forward to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea accepting the offer for dialogue so that real progress can be made in inter-Korean relations.  Eventually  I believe that we will see more peace and prosperity in North-East Asia. The region is already a major powerhouse for economic growth in the world. With the peaceful resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue  countries in the region will be able to accelerate cooperation to make North-East Asia more stable and future-oriented. Undoubtedly  that will in turn contribute greatly to the peace and prosperity of the world.  Currently  the international community is grappling with the grave financial turmoil that threatens to spread worldwide. It has even been feared that the turmoil could lead to a recession of the magnitude of the Great Depression of the 1930s. Without a doubt  the current instability in the financial market could have a devastating  domino-like impact on the real economy of this globalized world.  We have to be careful  however  not to rush into protectionist policies either for fear of uncertainty or out of self-interest. There are hard-learned lessons from the Depression of the 1930s: the “beggar thy neighbour” policy and the policy of raising tariffs to protect particular industries harmed the world economy. Therefore  I strongly believe that any solution should be based on an even closer cooperation within the international community and the open market economy.  Today  the expectations placed upon the United Nations by the international community are higher than ever. However  what the United Nations can achieve cannot be greater than the sum of all our individual achievements unless there are synergistic effects. Therefore  all of us  each and every Member State  should not only do our best in carrying out our responsibilities  but should also be willing to help and reach out to others. Only by doing so can this global body live up to and even exceed the expectations of the international community. To that end  the Republic of Korea will faithfully do its part. "
"94",3893,"KWT",63,2008,"At the outset  it is my pleasure to congratulate the President of the Assembly on his election to preside over the sixty-third session of the General Assembly and to wish him every success. We also wish to thank his predecessor  Mr. Srgjan Kerim  for his successful presidency of the Assembly during the previous session.   We should also like to express our appreciation for the important and outstanding role of the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  in support of the purposes and principles of the Charter of this Organization.  More than a year ago  the world witnessed the emergence of new international challenges and perils that hinder and disrupt efforts to achieve sustainable development in numerous countries  especially developing countries  and in particular the least developed among them. Most significant among those perils are the rise in the cost of food  basic commodities and energy  as well as climate change. The danger of those challenges lies in their global impact; their effects transcend national borders. No barrier or artificial restraint can withstand them. They will cause the international community to backslide significantly in achieving the Millennium Development Goals. Indeed  we have begun to see the negative effects of those threats in the African continent  which has achieved no significant progress in the eradication of poverty and hunger or in the struggle against such dangerous infectious diseases as AIDS and malaria. Instead  these challenges have exacerbated the suffering of most African States.  Those challenges  alongside such dangers to security as terrorism  the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and human rights violations  pose a serious threat to international peace and security  and meeting them will require prompt  collective  united and firm action under the umbrella of the United Nations and its various agencies. We must also remain firmly committed to the agreements and conventions that we have signed and ratified  and implement transparently and honestly the resolutions we adopt in international meetings and conferences.  While the State of Kuwait supports the reforms that have been adopted in our international mechanisms  the ongoing changes in and transformation of the world order and the emergence of new problems and challenges call for continued reform and the restructuring of many United Nations bodies to accompany those changes and improve their performance. In that regard  we reiterate our demands for necessary improvements in the working methods of the Security Council  including greater transparency in its work and an expansion of its membership pursuant to standards and controls to ensure equity in its representation and efficiency in the performance of its duties and responsibilities in the maintenance of international peace and security. Such reform must also take into consideration the legitimate demands of Arab and Islamic countries and the aspirations and interests of small States.  The State of Kuwait is pursuing its efforts to achieve economic and social development and to improve the living conditions of Kuwaiti citizens and alien residents. Kuwait has made good progress in implementing the commitments and resolutions of the 2005 World Summit. It has achieved all the Millennium Development Goals  including those on education and health  and advanced the role and empowerment of women in society. Furthermore  in carrying out the wishes of His Highness Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah  Amir of the State of Kuwait  to transform Kuwait into a regional financial and business centre  the Kuwaiti Government has taken numerous important decisions and adopted new policies with a view to restructuring the national economy and consolidating trade and investment activities so as to provide an investment atmosphere    08-51851 30  conducive to attracting national and foreign capital investment in such vital economic sectors as energy and infrastructure.  The State of Kuwait has spared no effort in continuing to provide development assistance to developing countries  particularly the least developed  through its official and non-official institutions. That consistent approach of Kuwait’s foreign policy emanates from its conviction that strengthening the economies of the developing countries and helping them fulfil their development goals will be beneficial to all. It will broaden the horizons of partnership  cooperation and solidarity and consolidate the global economic and trading systems.   Since its establishment in 1961  the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development has provided grants and loans to finance infrastructure projects in developing countries. The gross total amount disbursed in grants and concessionary loans by the Fund since its establishment in 1961 is over $12 billion and has benefited more than 100 countries.   The State of Kuwait continues to meet its financial obligations to international financial institutions and specialized international agencies in a full and timely fashion. The Government of the State of Kuwait decided in December last year to allocate 10 per cent of all its contributions and donations to disaster-affected countries to specialized international organizations and agencies working in the field.  In response to the suffering of many developing countries in the difficult economic conditions resulting from the increase in food and energy prices  the State of Kuwait has established the Decent Life Fund  with a capital of $100 million  to develop and improve agricultural production in developing countries. Kuwait has also announced the donation of $150 million to the Fund  which was established at the most recent summit conference of the countries members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries  held in the sisterly Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. That donation was earmarked for research studies in the fields of energy  environment and climate change.   The State of Kuwait continues to follow a balanced oil policy that takes into consideration the interests of consuming and producing countries alike and seeks to maintain stable oil prices on the world market. However  the unjustified rise in prices  which is a source of concern  is caused by factors that are out of the control of the producing countries. They include speculation  additional taxes on fuel  and the failure to build new refineries and to upgrade existing ones. The ongoing impact of all of those factors has aggravated the economic crises and led to rising rates of inflation in the developing countries.   In that context  we express our deep concern over the financial crisis in the world markets. We welcome in that regard the bold steps and actions taken by the United States Government to address the mortgage crisis and to mitigate its negative effects not only on the United States economy  but also on the economies of other States around the world.  Achieving sustainable development in the Middle East will depend to a large extent on the ability of the countries of the region and the international community to address security issues and challenges that are a constant source of tension and instability. In our desire to achieve peace  we call on the international community now and in the future to help calm the hotbeds of tension and instability.   Any genuine and serious desire to achieve a comprehensive  just and lasting peace must adhere to the relevant resolutions of international legitimacy  the principle of land for peace  the road map adopted under Security Council resolution 1515 (2003) and the Arab peace initiative  leading to the attainment by the Palestinian people of all their legitimate political rights and the establishment of their independent State on their own land. We reaffirm our full support for the sisterly Syrian Arab Republic in recovering its occupied lands. We also express our support for the sisterly Republic of Lebanon as it pursues dialogue between all Lebanese parties in implementation of the agreement signed in Doha  capital of the sisterly State of Qatar.  The State of Kuwait welcomes the progress achieved by Iraq in combating terrorism. It commends the Iraqi Government’s efforts and diligent endeavours  whose fruit include an obvious improvement in the security conditions in most Iraqi provinces. The State of Kuwait hopes that those endeavours will continue towards comprehensive national reconciliation and consensus leading to a democratic  free  secure and independent Iraq  living in peace with itself and its neighbours and respecting its international obligations and commitments.   31 08-51851   For its part  Kuwait will spare no effort in supporting regional and international efforts to assist Iraq in facing its security  political and economic challenges  as well as its efforts to ensure its security  stability  political independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity  and non-interference in its political affairs.  In that context  the State of Kuwait hopes that contacts between the sisterly United Arab Emirates and the friendly Islamic Republic of Iran will continue at all levels in order to find a solution to the conflict over the occupied islands of the Emirates in accordance with the principles and rules of international law and the policy of good-neighbourly relations.  While the State of Kuwait stresses the right of all States to produce  develop and use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes within the framework of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)  it calls upon the friendly Islamic Republic of Iran to pursue its cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency in order to dispel the fears and doubts about the nature of its nuclear programme. It also urges Iran to address all other outstanding issues.  We call on the international community to continue its efforts and endeavours to seek a peaceful solution that would spare our region from crises or wars that could undermine its security and stability  and to deal seriously and without favouritism with any country in the region not party to the NPT. That would pave the way for declaring the Middle East a region free from weapons of mass destruction of all kinds.  All the peoples of the world yearn to live a free  decent life in a safe and stable world in which justice  equality and a clean environment free of conflict  diseases and catastrophes prevail. It is our collective responsibility to lay the foundations for a new partnership  based on fair and balanced rules of justice and equality  in which each party would assume its responsibilities and obligations to realize the aspirations and hopes of our peoples.

"95",3939,"LAO",63,2008,"First  let me express  on behalf of the delegation of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic  my heartfelt congratulations to Mr. d’Escoto Brockmann  a veteran diplomat of Nicaragua  on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session. I trust that  with him at the helm  the work of the General Assembly is in good hands.   The Lao People’s Democratic Republic is of the belief that the United Nations remains an important and pre-eminent forum for addressing issues related to international cooperation for economic development  peace and security  human rights and the rule of law  based on dialogue  cooperation and consensus-building amongst States. For over half a century  the United Nations has played a crucial role in maintaining international peace and security and in promoting the socio-economic advancement of Member States  especially developing countries.   Yet  as the world situation becomes ever more complex and unpredictable  the United Nations increasingly needs more robust and effective institutions. In our opinion  United Nations reform must be comprehensive  transparent  inclusive and balanced. We must strengthen the role and authority of the General Assembly and revitalize its work.   We must also reform the Security Council  turning it into a more democratic and representative organ comprising new permanent and non-permanent members alike. No less important is the need to substantially reinforce the development pillars of the United Nations  which include the Department of Economic and Social Affairs  the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  the regional commissions and the United Nations Development Account  enabling them to better support developing countries.  In that context  we commend Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s reform efforts aimed at transforming the United Nations into a more responsive  dynamic  multifunctional and effective Organization. The Secretary-General’s personal dedication to the cause of peace  and his endeavours in search of solutions to the three global crises of finance  fuel and food deserve special recognition.  The current difficult and complex situation in the field of disarmament continues to be a cause of concern. We recognize the threat posed by the continuing existence of nuclear weapons. It is hence incumbent upon the nuclear-weapon States to honour    08-53135 2  their unequivocal commitment to work towards the total elimination of nuclear weapons. Renewed efforts are needed to resolve the impasse in achieving nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation in all its aspects.  While globalization brings with it numerous opportunities for economic development  the obstacles that the world faces deserve significant attention. Developing countries  in particular the most vulnerable group of countries — the least developed countries landlocked developing countries and small island developing States — have taken important steps to further integrate themselves into the global economy. Nevertheless  those countries remain beleaguered by basic infrastructure of poor quality  limited access to markets  capital and new technology  and low supply of finance and investment.  The sudden increase in oil and food prices has led to a period of economic instability in many countries. To combat that problem  we stress the need for the full and effective implementation of the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the establishment of a global food bank and an international food fund to ensure long-term food security for developing countries  particularly the most vulnerable among them.   In addition  the great untapped potential of those countries should be explored and exploited to the maximum extent through increased investment and technology transfer by developed countries and other development partners for mutual benefit.   The goal of achieving peace and prosperity remains the highest priority of the international community  yet inter-State conflict  terrorism and unlawful unilateral sanctions and interventions continue to impede that goal. We are greatly distressed by the persistent conflict that has plagued the lives of the peoples of the Middle East for decades  particularly of the Palestinian people  who have been fighting to exercise their right to self-determination and Statehood.   We are deeply saddened by the number of casualties and the material damage inflicted upon the nations of Iraq and Afghanistan. We remain troubled by the embargo that has been imposed on the Republic of Cuba by the Government of the United States of America  an act that is clearly illegal and not responsive to the legitimate interests of the peoples of either nation. In that regard  the Lao People’s Democratic Republic sincerely urges the parties concerned in the aforementioned conflicts to seek ways to peacefully resolve their differences. It is our fervent hope that the peoples living in those conflict-affected areas may enjoy peace and prosperity as swiftly as possible.  Unlike most calamities  global warming affects not only the livelihood of every being on the planet  but also the course of human history. Climate change will become all the more worrisome as it leads to many other social and economic problems in addition to those faced by our world today. That is why there is a need for immediate global action to address climate change in accordance with the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. In formulating policies to confront climate change  we should promote the integration of all three components of sustainable development — economic development  social development and environmental protection. In that respect  we call for the full implementation of the Bali Road Map.  As widely expressed at the high-level event on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  the lack of effective implementation of the internationally agreed development goals  including the MDGs  remains of deep concern. Therefore  the highest priority should be given to securing the effective and full implementation of the agreed goals and commitments. In that context  we underscore the urgency of addressing the special needs of least developed and landlocked developing countries through the full  timely and effective implementation by all stakeholders of the Brussels Programme of Action and the Almaty Programme of Action  as called for in the 2005 World Summit Outcome Document.  Landlocked developing countries face a unique impediment in not having access to the sea. International cooperation is crucial to the success of the development goals of those countries. We therefore would like to stress the significance of the upcoming midterm review of the Almaty Programme of Action  to be held on 2 and 3 October 2008 here in New York  which should provide the international community with the opportunity to assess progress made  lessons learned and constraints encountered in the implementation of the Almaty Programme of Action.  As a member country  the Lao People’s Democratic Republic is gratified to witness the   3 08-53135  continuing stability resulting from strengthened and enhanced integration of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)  which is an important contribution to the maintenance of peace and further cooperation in the region and the world. A recent momentous and milestone event was the signing of the ASEAN Charter  which has transformed ASEAN into a rule-based regional organization.  The Lao People’s Democratic Republic continues to enjoy solid political stability and social order. Thus  our socio-economic development has registered significant achievements  as reflected in the high and sustained growth of our gross domestic product. Notwithstanding those achievements  the Lao People’s Democratic Republic still faces impediments. Rising oil prices  inflation and the global economic slowdown all stand in the way of our path to economic prosperity.  This year  we have also experienced severe flooding that has inflicted huge material losses nationwide. Yet  in spite of all that  by improving the quality of basic infrastructure and human resources and cooperating with international partners  we are determined to pursue our twin strategies of poverty eradication and regional integration. At the current pace  we hope to extricate our country from the shackles of underdevelopment by the year 2020.  I cannot conclude without reaffirming that development remains central and must come first if peace and respect for human rights  which are intertwined  are to be achieved. The Lao People’s Democratic Republic reiterates its unshakable commitment to continued full cooperation with the international community in pursuit of a world free from fear and want  and rooted in a new  just and equitable order. Together  I am sure  we will be able to reach new heights. "
"96",3982,"LBN",63,2008,"I should like to begin by congratulating you  Sir  on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session.    13 08-51606   I should also like in particular to thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for the excellent report he has prepared on the activities of the Organization in the past year (A/63/1)  as well as for his concern in ensuring that the issues of Lebanon are at the centre of debate. In its close pursuit of the situation in Lebanon  the United Nations has established the foundations and principles necessary to face the crises and challenges that have undermined the stability and prosperity of our country. I would like to note in particular the role of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) and pay tribute to the sacrifices of its personnel. I note also that in his report the Secretary-General notes that there is strong cooperation between UNIFIL and the Lebanese army. I would like to confirm that Lebanon cares a great deal about the security and safety of those troops  especially vis-à-vis the terrorist attacks of which they have been the target.  Lebanon is the cradle of an ancient civilization. Its peace-loving people set sail from their shores towards the European continent  carrying with them elements of an advanced alphabet and spreading in the Mediterranean realm and whatever horizons they were able to open the spirit of communication  dialogue  and free exchange.  Lebanon  which believes in human and cultural values  is one of the oldest parliamentary democracies in the Middle East. Its constitution of 1926 embraces freedom of opinion  freedom of belief and justice and rejects confessionalism and fanaticism. In its endeavour to put this democracy into practice  our nation experienced a distinctive alternation of power despite all the crises  aggression and wars it has known. Today  our country is preparing for new parliamentary elections.  The young Lebanese nation that emerged in 1943  however  suffered from the aftermath of the catastrophe that befell Palestine in 1948. It has received on its narrow territory hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees. Since the late sixties  it has been subject to two large-scale Israeli invasions and to a series of Israeli devastating attacks that wreaked havoc in terms of lives  property and infrastructure. The records kept by this Organization bear witness to that brutality.   I recall the two massacres of Qana that were perpetrated against innocent children  women and the elderly  as well as the aggression of July 2006 in which tens of thousands were killed and wounded and displaced which led to the destruction of bridges and civilian facilities in various parts of the country. The Israeli bombardment of the Jiyeh power plant and its fuel storage tanks caused an environmental catastrophe resulting from an oil slick along the Lebanese coastline. That prompted the General Assembly of the United Nations to request Israel to provide immediate and adequate compensation to Lebanon for the damage and pollution it caused. Israel must pay due compensation for the full damage it caused through its repeated aggression against Lebanon.  The United Nations has not hesitated to shoulder its responsibilities towards Lebanon. The Organization issued a series of resolutions in support of Lebanon’s independence  sovereignty  unity and territorial integrity  notably Security Council resolutions 425 (1978)  which called for an immediate and unconditional Israeli withdrawal from all Lebanese territory  and 1701 (2006)  which “calls upon the Government of Israel ... to withdraw all of its forces from southern Lebanon”. Lebanon reiterates its commitment to the full content of that resolution.  Mr. Yañez-Barnuevo (Spain)  Vice-President  took the Chair.  However  the intransigence of Israel and its failure to comply with the will of the United Nations Security Council pushed Lebanon to adopt  in conjunction with diplomacy  other legitimate options. In 2000  thanks to its people  army and resistance  Lebanon was able to force Israel to withdraw from most of the Lebanese territory that it occupied. This year  successful efforts were made  with the help of the United Nations  to complete the liberation of the Lebanese prisoners and detainees from Israeli prisons.  Despite these achievements and its continued commitment to the resolutions of international legitimacy  Lebanon still faces a host of urgent risks and challenges that require the following.  First  the international community should compel Israel to fully implement resolution 1701 (2006) and stop its serious threats to launch a new war against Lebanon. Such threats are acts of aggression that adversely affect the Lebanese State  the national economy and civil society.  The second challenge is the recovery or liberation of the remaining occupied Lebanese territory in Shabaa Farms  the hills of Kfarshuba and the northern part of    08-51606 14  the village of Al-Ghajar  and the upholding of our rights to our water.  Thirdly  Israel must be forced to stop its extensive air breaches of Lebanon’s sovereignty. In its most recent briefing to the Security Council  the Department of Peacekeeping Operations confirmed the provocative nature of those actions.  Fourthly  we must obtain all the maps of landmines and cluster-bomb sites left behind by Israel on Lebanese soil. Their presence constitutes a direct threat to the civilian population  especially children. It deprives farmers and families of their livelihood and prevents them from cultivating their land. The States concerned are therefore called upon to meet their pledges to provide the necessary resources for demining declustering programmes.  Fifthly  we need to confront terrorism in all its forms and to maintain internal civic peace. The Lebanese army and the internal security forces have been subjected to brutal attacks by terrorist groups in recent years. They were forced to confront such terrorist groups and make costly and huge sacrifices to defend the dignity of the Lebanese people and their security and stability. In their efforts to combat Israeli terrorist operations  the Lebanese security services managed to arrest the head of an Israeli network that carried out espionage and assassination operations on Lebanese soil.  The sixth challenge is to develop a comprehensive national strategy to protect and defend Lebanon  which would be adopted and coordinated through genuine national dialogue  which we held on 16 September. That is in accord with the Doha Agreement  which is based on the sincere will for national reconciliation and on extending the authority of the Lebanese State over all of its territory.  On this occasion  Lebanon reiterates its commitment to the international tribunal established under Security Council resolution 1757 (2007) to investigate the crime of the assassination of martyr Prime Minister Rafik Hariri and his companions. Lebanon is cooperating with the relevant organs of the United Nations to bring the truth to light and to achieve the process of justice away from any politicization.  Lebanon closely follows the developments of the situation in the Middle East. In view of its commitment to just Arab causes  especially the cause of Palestine  Lebanon reiterates its commitment to the process of achieving a just and comprehensive peace in the region and to the Arab peace initiative that was unanimously adopted by Arab leaders at the 2002 Beirut Summit. Having said that  Lebanon stresses the need for Israel to withdraw from all Arab territories that are still under occupation and stresses the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to return to their land and to establish their independent State on their national soil.  We call on the international community to assume its full responsibilities to provide the necessary financial resources to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) and to support the work carried out by the Lebanese State in this area  until a just solution to the Palestinian problem is found.  From this rostrum  Lebanon cannot but draw the attention of the international community once again to its absolute rejection of any form of resettlement of the Palestinian refugees on its territory  for the following main reasons.  First  the resettlement of the Palestinian refugees in Lebanon runs counter to their right to return to their homeland and homes  which is reaffirmed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the relevant United Nations resolutions.  Secondly  it is difficult for a small country like Lebanon  with limited resources and a population below 4 million people  to provide a decent livelihood for more than 400 000 Palestinian refugees on its territory at a time when large segments of the Lebanese people are emigrating in search of their own livelihoods.  Thirdly  the resettlement of Palestinian refugees is explicitly rejected in the preamble to the Lebanese Constitution  and by the Taif Agreement  which has been recognized and enshrined by resolutions of the United Nations and constitutes a key element of consensus in Lebanon.  While the issue of Lebanon is at the centre of attention of the United Nations  the agenda of our General Assembly is full of items and of political  economic  social and environmental topics that are still waiting for a comprehensive solution. In that context  Lebanon interacts in a special way with the needs and aspirations of the African continent  where hundreds of thousands of Lebanese citizens have been living on its   15 08-51606  generous soil for over a century  contributing to Africa’s prosperity and development under difficult circumstances. Accordingly  we support the political declaration issued yesterday at the high-level meeting on Africa’s development needs. We therefore believe that a major international effort should be undertaken to finance programmes to combat poverty  disease and illiteracy as a means to preserve human dignity and to prevent further armed conflicts on that continent.  Similarly  we hope that a more effective project to build solidarity in the face of natural disasters will be quickly and efficiently finalized in view of the increasing risks arising from climate change  global warming  environmental degradation and the spread of wildfires in forests and green spaces.  Deeply rooted in history and  with the rise of nationalist movements  a contributor to the shaping of the Arab renaissance at the political  cultural  intellectual and social levels  as well as a founding member of the League of Arab States  Lebanon is devoted to preserving Arab solidarity. In that context  we need to revisit the concept of cooperation and good-neighbourliness between countries to consolidate peace and solidarity in the world. That approach will contribute to preserving human rights  and humanity will thus be able to prevent other world wars  regional conflicts and the transnational phenomenon of terrorism  as well as upheavals in our globalized economies  global crises and food crises. All of those matters represent major threats that could spark new wars that might spill over onto the regional level and from one continent to the next.   We need to push for United Nations reform in order to meet that new international challenge. Lebanon is extremely pleased to announce that we have been nominated once again to a non-permanent seat on the Security Council for the biennium 2010-2011. We are of course committed to making a positive and constructive contribution to the Council and hope that we will have the support of all friendly and brotherly States.   Lebanon’s philosophy has been based on dialogue and coexistence from the day its citizens approved the National Covenant in 1943  and subsequently when they approved the 1989 National Reconciliation Agreement in Taif. Those themes were also repeatedly stressed in the 2008 Doha agreement. In the face of worsening international conflicts that herald a potential clash of civilizations  Lebanon might well represent a needed international example as a living laboratory of dialogue of cultures and religions.  In his Apostolic Letter of 1989  His Holiness the late Pope John Paul II described Lebanon as “more than a country; it is a message of freedom and a model of pluralism for both the East and the West”. Moreover  in his homily delivered during his apostolic journey to Lebanon in 1997  John Paul II characterized Lebanon as “a country of many religious faiths  [which] has shown that these different faiths can live together in peace  brotherhood and cooperation”. With 18 different sects coexisting on its soil  and having successfully preserved its democratic system and fundamental freedoms in spite of all sorts of challenges  Lebanon aspires today to become an international centre for the management of dialogue of civilizations and cultures  hoping that the forces of good in the world will prevail and that we can be constructive in our efforts to reach a just and comprehensive solution to all aspects of the conflict in the Middle East as soon as possible."
"97",4028,"LBR",63,2008,"I am honoured to address the General Assembly on behalf of the Government and the people of Liberia  the second time I am doing so since I assumed office in 2006.   I congratulate you  Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann  and your country  Nicaragua  on your election as President of this historic sixty-third session. There is no doubt that you will bring your vast experience to bear in guiding this session to a successful conclusion. You can rest assured of the full cooperation and support of the Liberian delegation.  Let me also seize this opportunity to pay tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Srgjan Kerim of the Republic of Macedonia  for the exemplary leadership he provided this body over the past year.  By the same token  I would like to commend the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  for his farsightedness and wisdom in carrying out his mandate. The Liberian people still recall with fondness his visit to Monrovia earlier this year  when they shared with him their respect and appreciation for the United Nations  which has provided exceptional support as a guarantor of the peace we now enjoy in our country after 14 years of war.  In our 161 years as the first independent republic in Africa  we navigated for nearly a century among the sharks of racism  colonialism  prejudice  human degradation and underdevelopment. We have experienced a war that killed nearly 8 per cent and displaced 40 per cent of our population  a war that destroyed our underdeveloped economy and inadequate infrastructure. Through it all  Liberia has come to appreciate the United Nations as a truly fundamental  relevant and important forum and instrument for world peace.  In its 63 years of existence  the United Nations has expanded in scope  form and content. It is  correctly  still primarily concerned with the promotion of international peace and security. On the basis of our experience as a founding Member  Liberia is committed to contributing to the redefinition of that international peace and security that it is very strongly linked to and demands the promotion of economic growth and sustained development  particularly food security  relief from the debt burden  globalization and fair trade.    08-51570 18   We believe in a peace and security environment that combats HIV/AIDS  malaria and other diseases and that promotes poverty eradication and human rights  especially the rights of women and children. We believe in the fight against international terrorism  drugs and other international crime  and we believe in disarmament  especially the elimination of nuclear weapons and the control of small arms and light weapons.  The history and experience of Liberia have taught us to have faith in the United Nations  which today maintains nearly 11 000 men and women from all over the world helping our country consolidate its newly won peace. We wish to thank the Security Council  which has correctly seen the necessity to renew the mandate of the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL). We particularly thank the resource-contributing countries  for  without them  we would never be able to save the lives we are saving and promote the development we are promoting.  Our history and experience have taught us to believe in regional peace and security and cooperation. Liberians still say  with passion: “Thank God for ECOMOG” — the Monitoring Group of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) — referring to the period of our war when young men and women from ECOWAS countries  led by Nigeria and including Senegal  Ghana  Guinea  Sierra Leone  Mali and Benin  laid down their lives to save our country. Subsequently  a Nigerian-led military mission  the ECOWAS Mission in Liberia. provided the beachhead for the establishment of UNMIL. We shall always be grateful to ECOWAS  which is now dedicating itself to its prime objective of economic integration and development.  We also believe in our subregional entity  the Mano River Union  which comprises the countries of Liberia  Guinea and Sierra Leone and now  Côte d’Ivoire  which joined us earlier this year. The Mano River basin  as is well known  had been the epicentre of the conflict system in West Africa since 1990. As the current Chair of the Union  I can say on behalf of my colleagues that the countries of that basin have declared never again to war and all forms of armed violence. The Mano River Union will henceforth be a net exporter of peace and all the dividends that come with peace in West Africa.  I am proud to say that Liberian history and experience have taught us never to shirk in our opposition to wars and the causes thereof  to man’s inhumanity to man  to oppression  racism  human rights abuses  especially those against women and children  and abuses inflicted on the basis of race  creed and religion.  In doing so  we know that we may at times not be seen as following the party line  be it in Africa or on African issues  or the positions of some close allies. We continue to ask our friends to realize that we will be guided by our principles  history and experience to act in the best interest of our people and of the greater world community.  It is in this connection that we took a stand on the situation in Zimbabwe  because we had faith that the leaders of that wonderful and great country needed to know that fairness in elections and justice in political participation were the best ways to ensure durable peace. My Government wishes to thank the Zimbabwean leaders and their people for choosing the path of negotiation for the comprehensive agreement that has now been reached. We thank the leaders of the Southern African Development Community — especially South African President Thabo Mbeki  for his role in facilitating the peace deal. May all Zimbabweans work to ensure full implementation of the agreement.  Over the past year  Africa has registered unprecedented economic growth and has experienced relative peace in many hitherto-turbulent regions and countries. Unfortunately  people in Somalia  in parts of the Sudan — especially the Darfur region — Chad  Niger  the Democratic Republic of the Congo and other countries have yet to breathe the air of relief and peace. They need the concerted efforts and support of the United Nations for the African Union and subregional bodies to take the actions necessary for peace. Where there is evidence of non-cooperation and even aggression against peace forces  the world must move into gear under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter.  As we have seen in Liberia and throughout the world  armed conflicts are exacerbated by easy access to small arms and light weapons. Thus  as part of the efforts for durable peace in conflict zones  we must put in place rigid measures to ensure effective control of such weapons. In that connection  my Government   19 08-51570  supports an arms trade treaty. We continue to champion the call for total and complete nuclear disarmament in order to prevent the world from annihilating itself.  Those fears are not unfounded if we imagine such weapons in the hands of a terrorist. But the threat of terrorism — the senseless destruction of innocent lives and property — oftentimes even defies the imagination. The world must unite to fight that scourge. No nation or person is protected against it. Those who feel angry enough to carry out such dastardly acts defeat their own purposes because they end up killing those who may be ready to let the world hear about their causes. They actually end up losing everything. We grieve with those who lost their loved ones during the terror attacks in Pakistan even while the world was meeting here.  While some plot evil deeds  there are those who are committed to working with Liberia and Africa and the rest of Africa to fight poverty and to promote positive  all-around international cooperation. We are grateful for the many avenues for cooperation that have been provided. We thank the United States for its African Growth and Opportunity Act  which aims to promote trade rather than aid; we thank the European Union for its Everything but Arms facility; we are grateful for the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation; we thank the Japanese Government and its partners for leading the Tokyo International Conference on African Development; and we thank others to whom the continent is looking for new avenues for sustained development. We are pleased to note that our cooperation efforts have included intra-Africa and South-South endeavours  with great successes having been achieved so far.  Beyond Africa  my Government believes  with great interest  that a durable solution can be found to the Israeli-Palestinian and Arab-Israeli conflict. Late last year  I had the opportunity to visit and hold talks with Israeli and Palestinian leaders alike in Tel Aviv and Ramallah. I gathered from conversations and reports regarding other sustained efforts in search of peace that the solution of two States  with secure and recognizable borders and mutual recognition of each other  is the way forward. We must never give up working for a formal end to the conflict and for a durable peace for all in the region.  I should now like to report briefly on Liberia  the country for which  we dare say  the United Nations is most likely to receive its best-ever performance record. On 19 September 2006  approximately eight months after I had assumed the presidency of Liberia as the first woman to have been so elected in Africa  I addressed this body  laying out my vision for a country that had suffered near-total devastation — a country that was the best example of a State that had nearly collapsed. At that time  I said that Liberia was back  moving forward on an irreversible path of peace and development.  Today  I have come to renew that pledge. I have come to report how much progress has been made in the light of what we inherited. It should be remembered that we inherited a situation in which nearly two thirds of Liberians lived below the poverty line  with an even higher poverty rate in rural areas. The economy collapsed  with gross domestic product falling 90 per cent from 1987 to 1995 — one of the largest economic free-falls ever recorded in the world. Indicators in the areas of health  education  water  sanitation  food security and infrastructure were very poor and sometimes beyond measure.  My Government  with the support of international partners  began to take steps to move the whole country into gear. There was a need  first  for clear direction in the form of a national vision or agenda  formulated and contributed to by the people as their own; secondly  to restore the international reputation and creditworthiness of the country; and thirdly  to demonstrate the necessary leadership — strong  committed and focused — for the people.  The Government  in collaboration with civil society  undertook broad consultations with people in all parts of the country. That resulted in a framework for reducing poverty and making progress towards the Millennium Development Goals. Our poverty reduction strategy for the period 2008-2011 is now in place  anchored on the pillars of consolidating peace and security  revitalizing the economy  strengthening governance and the rule of law  and rebuilding infrastructure and delivering basic services.  Clearly  those three years are not enough time to accomplish the daunting tasks laid out in our poverty reduction strategy; they are part of a process aimed at long-term development that will continue far beyond 2011. They are part of a process that must identify effective responses to the food and energy crises and to the as-yet-undetermined effects of climate change.    08-51570 20  However  the Liberian people are gaining confidence in the strategy  for they are seeing that our national security policy  supported by the United Nations  is now producing the desired results.   They also know that  starting at a low base  we saw growth of more than 9 per cent in 2007. Roads and buildings are sprouting up in many places; health clinics are reopening or being established where they did not exist before; agricultural production is increasing; and a huge external debt is well on the way to being cancelled  with exceptional support from our partners.  We believe that that is truly a success story for a country emerging from so much destruction in so short a period of time. But we owe it first to our people — the Liberian people — and  very strategically and importantly  to the international community  led by the United Nations. The presence of the United Nations Mission in Liberia has given hope to the people that they need not surrender to the threat to peace and development represented by the large percentage of unemployed youth who cannot be absorbed by an economy that is still too weak  despite its high level of growth.  I come from a continent where female leadership — particularly a female head of State or Government — is still unthinkable in some quarters. I have only a handful of female colleagues at the global level. To help sensitize and energize the world with regard to the reality of female leadership  my friend and colleague Ms. Tarja Halonen  President of Finland  and I are organizing an international colloquium on women’s empowerment  leadership and development that will be held on International Women’s Day in March 2009 in Monrovia. I believe that this will provide us with the opportunity to make special efforts in support of women who are desirous to seek elective public office and to encourage other women to seek such office.  Mr. Golding (Jamaica)  Vice-President  took the Chair.  As I conclude  let me thank the President for the great work he and his colleagues are doing for a world meant for succeeding generations. Let me also say unequivocally that not only is Liberia back  but we are lifted and we are blessed. We thank all who have contributed to this progress. "
"98",4073,"LBY",63,2008,"Allow me at the outset  Sir  to express my country’s heartfelt congratulations to you on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session. We are confident that your experience and wisdom will crown our work with success and will result in further progress on the many important issues on the Assembly’s agenda.  I would like also to express my appreciation to your predecessor  Mr. Srgjan Kerim  for the efforts he made during his presidency of the General Assembly at its previous session. Our thanks go also to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his persistent efforts to implement United Nations resolutions and realize the purposes of the Charter.  Humanity faces many problems and serious challenges  which  no matter how great  would not be impossible to resolve if we evinced the necessary political will and made concerted efforts to overcome them. My country recognizes that peace  security and stability constitute the cornerstone of progress and development  especially in Africa. It has therefore made all possible efforts to resolve disputes in Africa  as was the case in Chad  the Central African Republic and the Sudan. My country has also contributed  along with other African countries and pursuant to resolutions of the African Union Peace and Security Council  towards putting an end to the insurgency in the island of Anjouan in the Union of the Comoros.  United Nations reform remains a matter of primary importance to the international community. Reform has indeed become a necessity dictated by the current dynamics in the international arena. However  while we commend the efforts of the Open-ended Working Group on Security Council Reform  which was chaired by the President of the General Assembly during its previous session  we feel that the process has been extremely slow because of broad differences between the various groups. Nonetheless  we welcome the consensus reached on the recommendations of the Open-ended Working Group at the end of the sixty-second session (decision 62/557). However  we believe that genuine United Nations reform is reform which places decision-making power in the hands of the General Assembly  the world parliament  while transforming the Security Council into an executive body that enforces the Assembly’s decisions. We can thus surmount the veto obstacle which has concentrated international decision-making power in the five permanent members of the Council.  My country therefore calls for the convening of a high-level General Assembly meeting on United Nations reform  to be held in a European country so that all world leaders can attend. In that context  we wish to emphasize that Africa  which is the only continent with no permanent representation on the Security Council despite the fact that it represents more   33 08-53135  than one fourth of the total membership of the United Nations  deserves permanent membership on an equal footing with other geographical regions. That representation should be given to the African Union rather than to any one of its members.  We have reached the midpoint of the period set for the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. We express our concern regarding the inability of many developing countries and least developed countries  especially in Africa  to achieve the Goals  we affirm that it is imperative for the international community to fulfil its commitments in the field of development assistance  address problems related to the international trade system  make the World Trade Organization more effective  and facilitate the accession to membership of that organization by developing countries.  In that regard  we welcomed the convening of the high-level plenary meeting of the General Assembly on 22 September 2008  on the theme of Africa’s development needs. We support the political declaration adopted at the meeting (resolution 63/1). We also welcomed the high-level event on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  held on 25 September 2008. Furthermore  we look forward to the international follow-up conference on financing for development to review the implementation of the Monterrey Consensus  to be held in Doha and we hope that the Conference will achieve its desired goals.  In that context  my country has contributed to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals through its proposed “Qadhafi Road” across the desert  which will connect the northern parts of the African continent with the western and southern parts. It will be an important artery that will enhance trade among the continent’s countries.  Corruption  bribery  money-laundering and the smuggling of funds from illegal sources are among the major factors which hamper development and the achievement of the MDGs in developing countries  especially in Africa. Huge damage is inflicted on developing countries as a result of the smuggling of funds across borders  which deprives those countries of the benefits of those funds  which are deposited in foreign banks. As the General Assembly has emphasized in its decisions  those funds should be returned to countries of origin. I must also note that there are safe havens that have always been associated with banking confidentiality  to the point where they have become known as corridors for criminal money-laundering and safe havens for stolen funds and plundered wealth.  It is no longer acceptable to remain silent on those safe havens  whose financial institutions provide protection for money generated from corruption and crime. Those funds are often used by terrorist groups and organized crime gangs to threaten the security and stability of States.  My country was among the first States to highlight the food crisis. The High-Level Conference on Food Security  held in Rome in June  was a responsible response from world leaders to the food crisis and the unprecedented increases in the prices of food  basic commodities and energy. I would like in that respect to thank the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the Director-General of the Food and Agriculture Organization for their efforts in that field.   To confront that problem  my country has adopted development projects and programmes which aim to achieve food security through improved investment in the agricultural sector and through support for farmers. In the African sphere  my country has allocated $5 billion to finance several development projects in order to achieve food security in a number of Sahelo-Saharan African States. It is also in the process of financing seven additional projects in African countries.  The food crisis has been a topic of personal concern for our brother Muammar al-Qadhafi  the Leader of the Revolution  who in June  at the tenth session of the summit conference of the Community of Sahelo-Saharan States  held in Benin  presented his initiative for the provision of food and the mitigation of the hunger crisis in Africa. The initiative is based on the establishment of a self-sustaining mechanism and the harnessing of modern machinery and technology to reclaim lands and farm vast areas in Africa  through the launching of a green campaign. The campaign will make it possible to farm vast areas of land in the Sahelo-Saharan States by mechanized means instead of traditional methods.  Developed countries can help Africa find a solution to the food crisis by increasing agricultural development assistance and investment in projects such as hydroelectric dams and development projects in lake    08-53135 34  areas  such as Lake Chad. Such investments will make a great contribution to agricultural development on the African continent.  Climate change and its negative impact will hamper the development efforts of many developing countries and will undermine their development gains. Libya is among the States affected by climate change  as it is located in an arid/semi-arid geographical area  and most of its territory is desert. Libya also suffers from desertification and water scarcity. Libya has made persistent efforts to address these challenges  including through the Great Man-Made River Project network  which is intended to overcome the problems of desertification and drought.  Confronting climate change requires an effective and well coordinated international effort  based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibility agreed upon in the Rio Conference. From that perspective  we call for accelerated efforts to reach a comprehensive international agreement to address the root causes of climate change and to provide adaptation measures to developing countries.  We believe in the purposes of the United Nations Charter  which calls for the establishment of a world in which peace and security prevail. The elimination of weapons of mass destruction is an essential factor in building confidence and promoting world peace  stability and security  and my country has voluntarily relinquished all its programmes to develop internationally prohibited weapons of mass destruction  while emphasizing the right to use atomic energy for peaceful purposes. But we strongly oppose the use of double standards on the issue of nuclear non-proliferation. We condemn any discrimination between one State and another in this respect and call for making the Middle East a region free from all weapons of mass destruction.  The Ottawa Convention on anti-personnel mines should be reviewed to reflect the concerns of many countries  such as requiring States that lay landmines to remove them and to address the inflicted damage  including by providing treatment and compensation for the injured and by rehabilitating the damaged environment.  Terrorism remains a matter of concern for all members of the international community. Despite all the measures taken to combat terrorism  thanks to international cooperation under the United Nations umbrella  this issue still poses a challenge to the international community and is an obstacle to the achievement of development  security and stability in many parts of the world.  Eradicating this phenomenon requires the adoption of a specific definition of terrorism. Terrorism must not be confused with the legitimate right of peoples to resist foreign occupation and claim their right to freedom  independence and self-determination. Furthermore  associating terrorism with any specific religion  nationality or culture is bound to inflame conflict among civilizations  religions and cultures. Such a situation is untenable and is incompatible with the goal of international relations based on mutual respect among States  cultures and systems of government. In this regard  we wish to point out that policies and practices of foreign occupation based on violations of human rights guaranteed by all international instruments and conventions constitute one of the worst forms of terrorism in our modern world.  The United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees  adopted in 1951  provides an ideal definition of refugee status  in addition to the definition included in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It is therefore regrettable that some States use this concept to camouflage their intentions regarding other States. Under the pretext of fostering democracy and respect for human rights  which is a noble goal  those countries have opened the door of political asylum to all seekers  including thieves  smugglers of their countries’ wealth  fugitives from prosecution and terrorists  enabling them to continue their subversive activities against their home countries. My country believes that it is of paramount importance to establish international criteria and controls governing political asylum  while carefully observing human rights. We also believe that such criteria and controls would have a positive impact on the fight against corruption and terrorism while promoting democracy and preventing armed conflict.  The Palestinian people are still suffering under the Israeli occupation  which has lasted for more than 60 years  subjecting Palestinians to the worst forms of occupation and destruction directed against civilians. The achievement of peace and stability in the area is impeded by the unjust siege imposed by the Israeli occupation forces on 1.5 million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and the continuation of settlement activities   35 08-53135  on occupied Palestinian territory  ignoring and deliberately breaching the principles of international humanitarian law and the principles of human rights  coupled with policies of home demolition  land confiscation  the displacement of populations and the intensification of arrests.  Indeed  peace and stability in the area can only be attained through the return of all Palestinian refugees to their homeland and the establishment of a democratic State on the land of Palestine in which Arabs and Jews can live  enjoying full rights and obligations  as our brother  the Leader of the Revolution  proposed in his recent book.  My country has always emphasized that there can be no comprehensive peace in the Middle East unless the Israeli occupation of the Syrian Golan and the Lebanese territories is ended. In this framework  we reiterate our call to the international community to demand and enforce the withdrawal of Israeli occupation forces from all occupied Arab lands and to ensure that their rightful owners are compensated for damages suffered as a consequence of that occupation.  My country welcomes the tangible improvement in the security situation in Iraq and believes that stability in that fraternal country depends on the achievement of genuine national reconciliation which would overcome sectarian and religious differences and lead to the withdrawal of foreign forces.  We express our deep concern at the situation in Somalia. My country is of the opinion that the international community should expeditiously dispatch forces to that country  in coordination with the African Union  to protect civilians and humanitarian workers and to assist in the implementation of the Djibouti Agreement  in order to put an end to the long suffering of the Somali people. "
"99",4106,"LCA",63,2008,"Saint Lucia is pleased to join the other Members of the United Nations family in congratulating His Excellency Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session. We wish him every success as he guides these important deliberations at this most critical time. We also wish to express our appreciation to his predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Srgjan Kerim  for the professional manner in which he spearheaded the work of the Assembly at its sixty-second session. In addition  we wish to acknowledge the important work undertaken by the Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon  and his team in continuing to promote the noble principles and values of the United Nations.   We have passed the midpoint in our quest to achieve the ambitious but achievable Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by the projected year  2015. Since the adoption of that timetable in 2000  however  the global economy has experienced a number of shocks that have served to challenge our ability to achieve the MDGs within the allotted time. We and the rest of the international community must redouble our efforts to meet those challenges by addressing them with serious conviction.  As the Secretary-General has said  we face a development emergency  and emergencies require immediate action. It is therefore imperative that the international community move with the utmost urgency to enact measures to address the challenges that have emerged. Inaction or indifference will only threaten to reverse the gains already made in some areas. We must ensure that our annual reaffirmations of the right to development and the rights to food  shelter  security and peace do not ring hollow.  In spite of the numerous difficulties and challenges with which it is faced  Saint Lucia maintains its commitment to the realization of the MDGs by 2015 and will do all within its means to attain that objective  even as new difficulties arise. For that reason  Saint Lucia’s social indicators are fairly reasonable and reflect the investment that has been made in human development over the years.   The reduction of poverty remains a top priority for my Government  and increased resources have been made available to programmes and institutions dedicated to the attainment of that objective.   In the education sector  universal access has already been achieved at the primary and secondary levels. Emphasis is currently being placed on improvement of quality at the primary and secondary levels  on expanded access at the tertiary level and on early-childhood education. More attention is also being given to the higher school-dropout rates among young men.   In the area of health care  reform of the health sector continues to be a priority  and significant progress continues to be made towards the achievement of free health care for all. Success continues to be recorded in respect of key indicators such as life expectancy  infant mortality and immunization coverage. Saint Lucia has achieved an even lower infant mortality rate than the 30-per-1 000 target set for the Caribbean by the World Health Organization  and we have already achieved 100 per cent immunization coverage. At the same time  the incidence of communicable diseases has been significantly reduced  although there is concern over chronic non-communicable diseases.  The AIDS pandemic continues to be the focus of our attention  and  with the assistance of regional and international partners  Saint Lucia has made important strides in addressing that challenge. Our current HIV prevalence rate is 0.12 per cent. We continue to focus on education as one of the main instruments in this fight  even as we devote increased resources to programmes geared towards early detection and the provision of free or subsidized antiretroviral drugs.  There are  however  two additional issues that are critical to development in Saint Lucia and that are not properly covered under the existing MDG framework. The first issue encompasses violence  crime and security. It is an issue that takes many forms  including   35 08-52265  gender-based violence  which should be addressed in the MDGs. The second issue is that of migration in all its dimensions  including the impact of the emigration of skilled workers — especially teachers and nurses — on national development. It is imperative that we also consider those two issues  as they affect the achievement of the MDGs and the development of Saint Lucia and many other countries.  A particular challenge confronting us is the emergence of serious climate change and its detrimental impact on the environment. Those conditions continue to disproportionately affect small island developing States  such as Saint Lucia and the other States members of the Alliance of Small Island States  whose national territories in the Atlantic  Pacific and Indian Oceans and the Caribbean Sea are extremely vulnerable.   Increased drought on the one hand and torrential rains and flooding on the other are affecting all parts of the globe and serve as recipes for disaster and human suffering. Those conditions are being attributed more and more to the unbridled and unsustainable use of fossil fuels and the concomitant release of greenhouse gases.  A second major challenge taxing our resolve  and also associated with fossil fuel use  is the astronomical rise in energy prices. The astronomical rise in energy prices has created a new challenge as the world seeks to replace fossil fuels with cleaner and more cost-effective biofuels. The trouble with that approach is that the decreased availability of agricultural production for food has resulted in higher prices for the staple foods of people around the world  especially in developing countries  but also among the marginalized of the developed world. That trade-off — food for fuel — if not carefully balanced  could cause increased poverty  hunger and economic and social marginalization  which would serve to exacerbate already unacceptable levels of poverty and hunger.  That notwithstanding  we are heartened by the renewed efforts and improvements in the renewable energy agenda  but we lament the slow pace of their use in developed countries and the high cost of those technologies to developing countries. There must be greater liberalization and availability of new technologies in order to allow developing countries more access to development models. In the meantime  we must redouble international efforts to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases to the levels already accepted by the large majority of the members of the international community.  Last July  I joined with my fellow Caribbean Community (CARICOM) heads of Government in reviewing the impact of rising global prices  the issues surrounding energy use and climate change and the implications for the region’s food and nutrition security. Among the issues arising from our deliberations  we emphasized the need for Governments to provide the necessary budgetary support and incentives for investment in agriculture  particularly at this time. And  given the importance and the development implications of climate change  we agreed to the establishment of a Task Force on Climate Change to give direction for the way forward.  It is from that perspective that Saint Lucia and many other like-minded countries have continued to emphasize the urgent need to focus on development based on sustainable economic growth as the most effective means of transforming developing countries and enabling them to reach levels where they can realize their long-term capacity for a significant enhancement of the quality of life of their people. Accordingly  Saint Lucia reiterates its strong conviction that the United Nations should regard development as the most essential tool for eradicating poverty and achieving the Millennium Development Goals.  As food prices and energy costs rise  development finance is becoming even less available. We appreciate the efforts of the countries that have met the established official development assistance target of 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product. We urge other countries in a position to do so to act quickly so that the target may not have to be shifted upwards due to increased poverty worldwide.  Of particular concern to us is the difficulty facing the lower-middle-income group of countries  to which Saint Lucia and many of the small island developing States belong. In spite of their limited resources  the members of that group have initiated prudent economic measures and have been able to make significant strides in their efforts to bring a reasonable level of economic and social benefits to their people.  However  policies that are ill-conceived and ill-advised will continue to negate our efforts and reverse some of the gains that have been made  forcing a    08-52265 36  reclassification of our status. We look forward to meaningful progress at the Follow-up International Conference on Financing for Development to Review the Implementation of the Monterrey Consensus  to be held in Doha later this year  and call on our development partners to give practical expression to the numerous commitments that have been offered in the past  but that remain unrealized.  In Doha  we expect greater momentum on the question of trade and development. Many of our countries are characterized by small size and the associated vulnerabilities. While the products and services we have to offer are few  they are nevertheless the source of our livelihood. The investments in those products and services are significant for our countries  and while the pressure of competition from larger and more diversified economies may force the consideration of a wholesale shift in production focus  the economic dislocation that would result from the pursuit of such a strategy would be too overwhelming.  In addition  as small as our population may be  the youth sector is a sizable portion of our society  and they need to be given hope. The best avenue is through education and the development of small and medium-sized enterprises. Many countries have successfully developed through that route  but have failed to share their experiences with others. We therefore need the trade links to be open and fair  with greater consideration given to the very small States  so that we too can meet the hopes and aspirations of our young — and until now  patient — populations. In that respect  we call upon the United Nations Industrial Development Organization to play a more meaningful role in that endeavour.  South-South cooperation continues to be a significant component of Saint Lucia’s approach to development. Saint Lucia continues to benefit from the generous economic and technical cooperation among developing countries within and outside of the Caribbean region  including Cuba  Trinidad and Tobago  Brazil and Mexico  to name a few  while we continue to develop closer cooperation with our Latin American neighbours.  We therefore applaud the establishment of the South Fund for Development and Humanitarian Assistance approved at the second South Summit  held in 2005 in Qatar  as a financing mechanism to assist developing countries in economic  social  health and educational development  and in the alleviation of hunger  poverty and the impact of natural disasters.  While developing countries have made great strides in financing their own development and the development of other countries of the South  greater cooperation in the area of technology transfer  particularly capacity-building and technical assistance  is required from the North. Capacity-building among young people is crucial to the development of the skills required to implement our commitments to achieve the MDGs.   We recognize the valuable role that both South-South and North-South cooperation play in the advancement of the development agenda. However  we know that triangular cooperation can be an equally useful and cost-effective tool for furthering our development objectives. We therefore welcome efforts in that area. Critical also to the realization of the MDGs is the delivery of aid commitments to developing countries without the burdensome conditionalities that are a typical feature of international programmes of development assistance.  The sustainable development of our sister CARICOM country of Haiti continues to be a formidable challenge faced by our region and the wider international community. It is one that requires the implementation of a long-term assistance programme that ensures that economic and social recovery take root and that the people of that country can be assured of a brighter future.  We wish therefore to applaud the Government of Haiti for its successful completion of the national growth and poverty reduction strategy focusing on improving democratic governance  security and justice  and the delivery of basic services. We call on the international community to assist Haiti in the speedy implementation of the national growth and poverty reduction strategy.  We therefore continue to call for the sustained release of pledged development resources so that the Government and the people of Haiti may continue to meaningfully  and in a sustainable manner  undertake measures to confront the numerous challenges to the development of their country.  Saint Lucia’s relationship with its partners is based on a commitment to mutual respect and understanding for each other. In that vein  Saint Lucia   37 08-52265  pays tribute to the Government and the people of the Republic of China  Taiwan  a democratic country that has continued to abide by the very principles that the United Nations holds dear  seeking to nurture and preserve human rights and development. We acknowledge the contribution that the Republic of China  Taiwan  has made to international development by its provision of substantial development assistance to developing countries in the spirit of South-South cooperation. The Government of Taiwan has provided significant cooperation assistance to Saint Lucia and other States in the areas of education  health  agriculture and tourism.  We are also heartened by recent bilateral discussions that would serve to reduce tensions in the Taiwan Straits and would result in an increase in economic cooperation  investment and transportation links. Natural disasters  epidemics and food and energy crises know no boundaries. The 23 million people in Taiwan are inextricably linked to the world scene and have the same responsibilities and obligations as others to collaborate in the prevention of global catastrophes. We hope therefore that this body will take that fact into consideration and allow them to meaningfully participate in the United Nations specialized agencies in the fight against such catastrophes.  Saint Lucia is seriously concerned about the proliferation of small arms in our part of the world. The presence of small arms in our region poses serious challenges for the security and stability of our societies. As we struggle to address that problem within our limited resources  we call on those States that are engaged in the production and trade of small arms and ammunition to enact appropriate measures to curb that illicit trade  which threatens the stability and security of our societies.  Saint Lucia remains concerned about the pace at which the matter of reform of the Security Council is proceeding. Reform of the Security Council has been on the agenda of the United Nations for much too long. We continue to support the view that it is time for the Security Council to be more democratic  in order to make it better able to deal with the increasing number and complexity of issues it must deal with and more reflective of post-1948 reality. In that respect  Saint Lucia supports the call for  at a minimum  a permanent seat on the Council for the African continent  just as other continents have such a seat.  Recent events are providing a vivid illustration of the need for reform of the Security Council. Large size  military power  economic power  or large population are not in themselves sufficient criteria for a permanent seat on the Council. Adherence to the principles enshrined in the Charter of this Organization should be paramount over all others.  In closing  Saint Lucia is a small country with resources that would fail to register in global terms. Yet  small as we are  our people have hopes  aspirations and ambitions like any other. Moreover  we hold the firm belief that we have the capacity to contribute to the world in a measured way beyond our size. We are probably best at economics  working miracles with limited resources  and literature  where our aspirations are clearly articulated — having two Nobel Laureates in these areas. We hold the view that our limited resources should be utilized and focused on improving the quality of life of our people in education  health  social services and economic opportunity. Those are our primary aims  and we believe them to be in conformity with those of this eminent Organization. "
"100",4133,"LIE",63,2008,"Since we gathered here a year ago  the world has experienced many serious challenges. Natural disasters  climate change  violent conflicts  terrorism  human rights violations  rising food and energy prices and financial turmoil have affected the lives of people worldwide. Dealing with crisis after crisis is a daunting task. Without the United Nations  it would in many respects be a hopeless one.  Indeed  it is the United Nations that gives hope to people around the world and it is the United Nations that gives political leaders a unique tool to solve problems and to settle conflicts. It was created more than sixty years ago  under the still-fresh impression of the horrors of the Second World War and with a strong focus on matters of peace and security. Today  the world is a different place  and yet we must keep turning to the United Nations to solve our problems together and to protect those most in need and danger.   We applaud the Secretary-General and the dedicated United Nations personnel for their hard work. Nevertheless  the Organization is sometimes mired in bureaucracy  inefficiency and political infighting. But the blame falls mainly on us  the Member States. It is our responsibility to adapt the United Nations to today’s challenges and to make it the best possible organization to that end. We must equip the Organization with the resources it needs and make the necessary adjustments in its structure.  In recent years  the regular budget of the Organization has grown in a completely lopsided way. Core activities  such as conflict prevention  the promotion of human rights and the rule of law  humanitarian assistance and support for economic and social development  are subject to an artificial policy of zero budget growth and must be financed largely through voluntary contributions. At the same time  States have come to routinely accept massive increases in peacekeeping bills. It is high time that we shift our focus from fighting fires to preventing their outbreak. We therefore fully support the efforts of the Secretary-General to enhance the conflict prevention and mediation capacities of the Secretariat.  The session just concluded brought about a sobering realization that some of the reform processes initiated at the 2005 World Summit have effectively come to a halt. Others have yet to be the subject of extremely difficult negotiations. We believe that quick progress is necessary on a number of management reform issues  from human resource management to accountability and internal justice. We will also continue our work to achieve a more legitimate and more effective Security Council. To that end  we will step up our efforts to enhance the involvement and access of those who are not members of the Council.   Liechtenstein is a strong believer in multilateralism and in a rule-based international system. Our national sovereignty is grounded in international law and its observance  and we are therefore strongly committed to the rule of law. Those principles were chief among our motivations for joining the United Nations 18 years ago  and they have been high among our priorities as a Member ever since.   The rule of law has gained much prominence in the work of the United Nations over the past few years  but it has yet to take the central place that is its due. The most precious asset of this Organization remains the legitimacy that it lends to decisions of the international community. In fact  the United Nations symbolizes the rule of law in international relations. We must preserve that strength and therefore also promote the rule of law within United Nations organs  including the Security Council  and their decision-making.   Together with other countries  we have expressed long-standing concerns about the current practice of the Security Council regarding sanctions listing and delisting  in particular in the area of counter-terrorism. There should be no doubt that we fully support the sanctions regimes  which constitute powerful tools for the maintenance of international peace and security  but we also believe that the procedures applied must be in accordance with basic international standards of due process. Recent court decisions indicate that our reservations are well founded  and we hope that our proposals will contribute to the improvement of the system. We must avoid the impression that decisions of the Security Council might be in violation of human rights standards.  All of our countries  and the Security Council in particular  are also called to task in the fight against   9 08-53135  impunity. Since the 1990s  the Council has adopted a number of landmark decisions to enforce international criminal law  including the decision to establish international and mixed tribunals. The Council also has an important role to play in connection with the International Criminal Court  which deals with the most serious crimes under international law. The Council did so in adopting resolution 1593 (2005)  and it is essential that it continue to exercise responsibly its powers under the Rome Statute.   Mr. Stratan (Republic of Moldova)  Vice-President  took the Chair.  The International Criminal Court is the most important achievement in decades in the area of international law. Now we must make it work in practice and give it the necessary political support. The success of the Court will be the yardstick in the fight against impunity. If we want to win that fight  we must show resolve by supporting the Court.  Years ago  the General Assembly adopted the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide  and the International Criminal Court was given jurisdiction over that crime 50 years later. The Convention was born of the desire to prevent the recurrence of genocide  yet it failed to achieve that purpose on several occasions following its adoption. The rallying cry “Never Again!” can be used only so often before it loses credibility. In that spirit  all of us agreed to the concept of the responsibility to protect when we met at the summit level three years ago. For us and for many others  that was one of the most significant gains achieved in the 2005 World Summit Outcome  which was otherwise a mixed bag. Still  we are struggling with the challenge to make the concept widely understood and to apply it in practice.   The responsibility to protect is a narrow concept that is limited to clearly defined cases of genocide  war crimes  ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. It is based on the sovereign responsibility of States to protect their own populations as well as the United Nations Charter. We must maintain that conceptual clarity and provide for consistent implementation of the Summit decision.  In spite of the lofty aspirations expressed at the 2005 World Summit  we are still far from taking a common approach to the development agenda  and the challenges are growing rapidly. Climate change  the food crisis  the energy crisis and the faltering international financial system are just a few examples. All those challenges hit particularly hard those who already live in poverty  and they also threaten to undermine the effectiveness of our development cooperation. We therefore need a consensus on financing for development that builds on the Monterrey Consensus. Such an agreement will require significant sacrifices and compromises on all sides  and it is sorely needed to strengthen the development pillar of multilateral cooperation.  Let me say in conclusion that we have always stood and fought for a strong General Assembly. By that  we do not mean an Assembly that develops an antagonistic relationship with other organs of the United Nations. We want an Assembly that is a forum for meaningful and focused discussions on topics of high relevance  followed by clear decisions and their implementation. We hope that this session will allow us to take a step in that direction. "
"101",4180,"LKA",63,2008,"Sri Lanka congratulates the President on his election to this high office. We are confident that your guidance will enable the General Assembly to make progress on the important issues confronting humanity to make the work and role of the United Nations more relevant to the lives of billions of people.  While my mother tongue is Sinhala  let me elaborate a few thoughts in Tamil. Sinhala and Tamil are the two languages of the people of Sri Lanka. Both have been used through the centuries  are rich in literature and are widely used in my country  with recognition as official languages. With the widening of democracy in our country  the bonds between the Sinhala and Tamil people of Sri Lanka will grow stronger and remain a major force for its future development. We will march towards a richer freedom and the lasting unity that await us as a nation.  The theme of our debate — “The impact of the global food crisis on poverty and hunger in the world as well as the need to democratize the United Nations” — is indeed far-sighted. It focuses on one of the critical survival needs of humanity  as well as one of the key institutional needs of the world body. The global food crisis has become a frightening actuality and has the potential to assume even more dangerous proportions if we fail to take urgent and collective action. Similarly  a less democratic United Nations runs the risk of being less effective and less credible  while giving rise to major concerns about its legitimacy.  Through a series of projects with regional impact  Sri Lanka will contribute to the goal of increasing food production  investing more in agriculture and research and sharing technologies and best practices. That is an integral part of the rural empowerment that is so essential in the developing world  as the vast majority of our people are rural based and depend on agriculture for their livelihoods. Achieving food security would require strengthening and revitalizing the agriculture sector. That calls for the empowerment of small- and medium-scale farmers through a series of measures. Those represent vital collective steps by all of us in the    08-51749 2  United Nations system. Sri Lanka sees self-sufficiency as the answer to overcoming the food crisis and giving strength to nations. No longer can we expect farmers in developing countries to be mainly producers for export markets.   In that context  implementation of effective social safety nets remains a priority as reassurance and empowerment. That is why we have introduced social security measures such as the fertilizer and fisheries subsidies. The advice given by some powerful countries and powerful institutions are contrary to that. Yet it is necessary that we pay no heed to such advice and determine to do what is best for the innocent people of our countries.  As the current Chair of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC)  I have the honour to state that at the recent summit we affirmed our resolve as a region to make our own contribution to grapple with the food crisis and to make our region revive its historic critical role in food production by once again becoming a major granary of the world. We also decided on the immediate establishment and operationalization of the SAARC Food Bank. That mechanism  we believe  will help considerably to ensure both food and nutritional security for the people of South Asia. That initiative will contribute to the larger global efforts that we launched in Rome  in June this year  to avert and mitigate the impact of the food crisis.  We must also find solutions to the energy crisis that are both equitable and pragmatic. Energy supplies must be diversified by developing advanced  cleaner  more efficient and cost-effective technologies for both fossil fuels and renewable energy sources. We need to engage in energy conservation and accept the reality of dependence on fossil fuels for much longer.  Equally obvious is the imperative of transferring new technology to the developing countries. In our own region  we will use increasing resources of human and scientific talent to produce our own technologies  making the best use of the natural resources  the sun  wind and the ocean  which we have in abundance  free of the restrictions of the marketplace. The demands of humanity can no longer be allowed to be at the mercy of speculative or captive markets.  To that end  Sri Lanka’s own view is that the United Nations and its agencies must take leadership in developing a framework for international cooperation. We urge caution in the rush to use biofuels to break our dependence of fossil fuels. It has already been seen that the rush to biofuels has contributed to high food prices. Sri Lanka’s policy is that no arable land should be diverted or directed to the production of biofuels  however profitable that may be in the short term. It was propitious that Sri Lanka acted with courage and foresight over the last three years  without being cowed by many pressures  and thus did not confront any situation where our people had to face hunger or starvation.  On climate change  SAARC leaders reiterated the need to redouble efforts within an expanded regional framework for environmental protection  conservation and justice. We stressed that we should contribute to restoring harmony with nature  a part of the heritage of South Asia. We humans have interfered with nature too much for too long. We must accept that the dangers of climate change are man-made and that its solutions  too  require man’s intervention.  Since the promulgation of the Charter of the United Nations to save succeeding generations from the tragedy of war  at least the major threat of intercontinental war seems to have receded. However  the just struggle of the Palestinians for statehood continues.   Today  the United Nations and its peoples are confronted with the fast-spreading menace of terrorism  which manifests itself in various forms in Asia  Africa and Latin America. The United Nations has a grave responsibility to save today’s and succeeding generations from that new and continuing menace. We have been talking for long enough; it is time for clear action in that regard.  Like many other countries  Sri Lanka has not been spared this global menace. Exploiting perceived ethnic grievances that must and can be addressed through political means  a well-organized terror group  the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)  engages in blatant and brutal acts of terrorism  including suicide bombings  to seek negotiating leverage  political recognition and legitimacy.  I am saddened by the loss of life and destruction caused by the recent terrorist attack in Pakistan.   Our Government has always been ready to address the causes of these issues and effectively implement political and constitutional solutions to   3 08-51749  meet the aspirations and respect the rights of all communities. What the Government would not and could not do is to let an illegal and armed terrorist group  the LTTE  hold a fraction of our population  a part of the Tamil community  hostage to such terror in the northern part of Sri Lanka and deny those people their democratic rights to dissent and free elections. Through our past actions  we have proved it.  The Government has therefore declared its policy of engaging in dialogue and discussion with the democratic leadership of the Tamil community  a people who have lived in harmony with other Sri Lankans for centuries. Today  there are Tamil leaders holding responsible ministerial posts in my Government. A former Attorney-General of then Ceylon  Sir Ponnambalam Ramanathan  a beloved Tamil politician  had this to say at a public meeting in Colombo in September 1904: “I have been to many countries in the world. But nowhere have I seen such a friendly race as the Sinhalese  who also uphold high moral values.” Such was the harmony between the Tamils and the Sinhalese. But a malicious group has turned all of this upside down.  All successive Governments of Sri Lanka have endeavoured to resolve the problem for over 25 years  including through Norwegian facilitation and international co-chairs overseeing a so-called peace process that was treated with contempt by the terrorists. On each occasion that talks were held seeking peace  the terrorists of the LTTE walked out on the flimsiest of pretexts and reverted to terrorism of the worst kind  indiscriminately targeting innocent civilians.  Our Government will only be ready to talk to that illegal armed group when it is ready to commit itself to decommissioning its illicit weapons  dismantling its military capability and returning to the democratic fold. The Government has also made it clear that the elected Government cannot and will not permit the undermining of the territorial integrity of the sovereign United Nations Member State of Sri Lanka and the division of its territory. We are clear in this message.  The Government’s objective is to enable the people to enjoy the benefits of democratic processes and to speed development activities in those areas where there is a heavy presence of terrorists. That would be similar to the fast-tracking of economic development taking place in the Eastern Province of Sri Lanka  where former terrorists now serve as democratically elected Provincial Councillors  and a former child soldier conscripted by the LTTE is now the elected Chief Minister  having abandoned terrorism and embraced democracy.   Significantly  the restoration of democracy in the East of Sri Lanka was achieved in less than one year of it being freed from the clutches of terror.  Our Government has also sought and received the cooperation of the United Nations  the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and other agencies to help us in providing humanitarian assistance to internally displaced persons (IDPs) and other affected civilians. The Secretary-General’s Representative on IDPs  who visited Sri Lanka some years ago  said:  “Sri Lanka presents the unusual situation of a central Government providing relief aid to persons under the control of the main opposition group. In a world replete with examples of Governments and rebel groups using food as a weapon against civilian populations  the situation in Sri Lanka is one that deserves closer attention if not more publicity as an important precedent.” (E/CN.4/1994/44/Add.1  para. 67)  The Government of Sri Lanka continues this humanitarian policy even today  although we know that the terrorists seize a good proportion of those humanitarian supplies. Our supplies are not confined to food; they extend to medicines and all other essentials as well as schools and hospitals  with teachers  doctors  nurses  and all other essential staff. That is not all; the Government also purchases the paddy and other foodstuffs produced in those areas. I do not think there is any country in the world where there is a Government that provides such humanitarian assistance to terrorists that attack it. Our Government considers the supply of humanitarian relief to its people as its prime responsibility.  The complex situation in Sri Lanka needs to be addressed and resolved through an appropriate process of deterrent law-and-order action and patient political efforts of consensus-building. We have achieved the difficult but essential task of building peace in the Eastern Province and are confident that it can be done in the north as well.    08-51749 4   This session of the Assembly is a good time to take stock of progress made towards the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) around the globe. It is regrettable to note  as we do so  that most are behind schedule. The slowing down of global economic growth  financial turmoil and speculation  rising food and fuel prices and the impacts of climate change are clear obstacles. Also  sanctions imposed on the leaders of some countries  and on their leadership  based on their political role  following protests  are in fact  targeted at the innocent people of those countries.   The steadily growing menace of international terrorism  with related activities such as the smuggling of illegal arms  human trafficking  drug trafficking  money-laundering  and business empires run by terrorist groups undoubtedly undermine the fundamentals of humanity and civilization. It appears that steps taken by us to eradicate such illegal activities have not been effective. This further complicates all national and international efforts at moving towards realizing the MDGs. Terrorism  as I have emphasized many a time  by its very nature  pushes back even our modest achievements.  Another similar menace is threatening to devour our children  the most valuable asset of any nation. That is the insecurity of cyberspace which has not only helped corrupt the minds of our children but also exposes them to predators such as paedophiles  drug dealers and pornographic sites. Sri Lanka has banned pornographic and similar destructive sites from being available through Internet service providers. We are also controlling and restricting the use of mobile telephones for such damaging activities. That is an important area for world leaders to focus on.  It is important that urgent and collective actions  both short- and long-term  are taken to stem those adverse trends. Only such determined and concerted actions will enable progress to be made towards the realization of the agreed development goals  including the MDGs  and frustrate elements that are bent on reversing the gains made.  We must deeply commit ourselves as Members of the United Nations to forging a way forward from the limitations not seen by those who laid the foundations for this great institution of humankind. If we fail to do it now  future generations will curse us.  I wish to conclude my address with a verse from the Dhammapada  words from the Enlightened One:  “Victory breeds hatred   The defeated live in pain.  Happily the calmed live   Having set victory and defeat aside.” "
"102",4222,"LSO",63,2008,"My delegation associates itself with the compliments extended to Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at the present session  to his predecessor and to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.   13 08-53129   We greatly welcome the convening and the outcomes of the two high-level meetings — one on Africa’s development needs and the other on the Millennium Development Goals — that have been held during the course of this session of the General Assembly. Let us not lose the momentum generated by those two meetings.  Let me also thank the President of the General Assembly for advancing a very appropriate theme  “The impact of the global food crisis on poverty and hunger in the world as well as the need to democratize the United Nations”. The decision of the Secretary-General to establish the High-Level Task Force on the Global Food Security Crisis demonstrates the determination of the United Nations to champion a unified response to the current food crisis. That is indeed emboldening  and we welcome the progress that has been achieved so far by the Task Force in producing the Comprehensive Framework for Action.   The food crisis poses a serious threat to the fragile progress that is being made towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. It can also be a source of political instability in developing and often vulnerable countries. Policy initiatives that should be implemented by relevant stakeholders to overcome the crisis were adequately articulated in the outcome documents of the High-Level Conference on World Food Security: the Challenges of Climate Change and Bioenergy  held in Rome in June 2008. There  the bottom line was clearly drawn that  while current energy needs are real and urgent  they cannot and should not be allowed to compete with the call to ensure food security. The stakes are too high in many developing countries  Lesotho included  where abject poverty  malnutrition and the spread of HIV and AIDS have reached unacceptable levels. All humankind has a right to food  and hunger constitutes a violation of human dignity.  That is why my delegation regrets the lack of progress in the implementation of previous international commitments to fight hunger  particularly those contained in the outcomes of the 1996 and the 2002 World Food Summits. The Millennium Development Goal (MDG) of reducing by half the number of undernourished people by 2015 will not be achieved unless there is visible movement from rhetoric to action.  Lesotho was encouraged by the G8 Statement on Global Food Security that was recently issued at the Hokkaido Toyako summit. The Statement highlighted the importance of stimulating world food production and of increasing investments in agriculture. Hope-raising pledges were made at that summit and earlier ones. What remains to be done as a matter of great urgency is to deliver on those promises. Also  we call upon other development partners  including the Bretton Woods institutions  to scale up their efforts to help farmers in the least developed countries  particularly in sub-Saharan Africa  to raise agricultural production and productivity.  The preparedness of the African continent to shoulder its responsibilities in this regard was clearly reflected in a declaration entitled “Responding to the Challenges of High Food Prices and Agriculture Development” that was recently adopted at the African Union summit in Sharm el-Sheikh  Egypt  in July this year.  The establishment by the World Bank of two international Climate Investment Funds in May 2008  intended to provide innovative financing for developing countries to pursue cleaner development paths and also to help protect themselves from the impact of climate change  was another encouraging development. Our hope is that the Climate Investment Funds will be additional to existing official development assistance  which is so sorely needed by the developing countries to achieve the MDGs.  Peace and development are closely interrelated and mutually reinforcing. The United Nations cannot afford the luxury of complacency in its mandate for the maintenance of world peace and stability. Most importantly  let us not forget that the United Nations was born from the ashes of devastating world wars. Indeed  the primary purpose of the United Nations was and continues to be to prevent future wars and to create sustainable international security  but every year we witness the emergence of new hotspots and designer wars as some big and powerful States resort more and more to the use of force. Every time those States try to pursue the illusory goal of imposing their will by force on others  they create a more unstable and dangerous world.  Let me now address an issue of concern to my delegation — the abuse of the principle of universal jurisdiction. The Sharm el-Sheikh assembly of the    08-53129 14  African Union was seized with the issue of the abuse of the principle of universal jurisdiction by some countries that seem inclined to use the principle to target certain African leaders.  Of course  lest I be misunderstood  we do recognize that universal jurisdiction is a principle of international law whose purpose is to ensure that individuals who commit such grave offences as genocide  war crimes and crimes against humanity are brought to justice. That noble principle should be impartially and objectively applied so that it will not be abused for the political ends of some individuals or countries  as that could endanger international order and security.  It is a trite fact that the need for the application of the principle by individual States has been rendered unnecessary by the creation of the International Criminal Court (ICC). If a State is unable or unwilling to deal with certain grave situations  such a matter should be referred to the Court  which will deal with it impartially. As we know  even the Security Council refers certain situations to the ICC. We need only emphasize that the ICC was created by this world body and must enjoy the support and trust of the entire membership of the United Nations. It must also be immune from any external influences.  As we respond to the invitation to comment on the second part of our theme  “The need to democratize the United Nations”  we do so against the background of the integrity and credibility of the Security Council. We raise the issue of the integrity and credibility of the Council  recognizing fully its responsibility to uphold the three pillars of the United Nations: human rights  development and peace  and security.  The working methods of the Security Council continue to interest us precisely because the Council is the most powerful institution within the United Nations setting. It is charged with the responsibility for the maintenance of world peace and order and it is a custodian of human rights. In order to fulfil that mandate  the Security Council needs to always preserve its integrity and credibility. It is only when all Member States are convinced of its integrity and credibility that they will have confidence in it.  The Security Council can enjoy such confidence  however  if and only if it is seen to be transparent and democratic in its structures and accountable and responsible to the entire membership of the United Nations; if and only if it submits itself to the rule of law; if and only if it is objective and impartial in its work; if and only if the membership of the United Nations is convinced that it is not used as a policy instrument of any one State or group of States; and finally  if and only if it subjects all States Members of the United Nations to the same and equal treatment.  The Security Council should thus not turn a blind eye to a situation in one country and then act when a similar situation obtains in another. It must be an honest arbiter in conflicts. We all owe it to ourselves to work towards such reform of the Security Council that will help to preserve its integrity and credibility so that it can perform its lofty mandate more efficiently. Needless to say  the question of numbers  particularly numbers representing the African continent  is at issue  but I need not dwell on it as it has been amply covered by previous speakers.  Lesotho is also concerned that the Security Council continues to be seen to be encroaching on matters that fall within the powers and prerogatives of other organs of the United Nations  including the General Assembly. We believe that the Council must desist from assuming the legislative role of the General Assembly and from adopting binding resolutions that dictate domestic law for Member States. In some instances  the Council has sought to interfere in purely internal political matters that do not pose a threat to international peace and that  in any case  are being dealt with at the regional level. In our view  the usurpation by the Council of the mandates of other organs  including the Assembly  is not justifiable.  A few days ago  we witnessed a positive development in the southern Africa subregion when the leaders of the people of Zimbabwe put aside their political differences and joined hands to form a Government of national unity. We congratulate the people of Zimbabwe on that historic feat. We urge the international community to support the people of Zimbabwe in rebuilding their economy and in determining their destiny in an atmosphere of national harmony and peace. We also urge the leadership of Zimbabwe to ensure adherence to the principles of democracy  respect for human rights and the rule of law  as such adherence will have a catalytic effect on socio-economic initiatives in which Zimbabwe is involved.   15 08-53129   Finally  we urge the Security Council to support efforts to bring to an end the unilateral economic and financial embargo that has  for decades now  been imposed against Cuba. We further urge the Council to intervene more decisively on behalf of the people of Palestine and Western Sahara  who have  also for decades  been denied the right to self-determination.   Lesotho is supportive of any efforts that will bring about lasting and sustainable peace in the Middle East and in other conflict areas in Africa  the Balkans and around our globe. We recall that in his report “In larger freedom: towards development  security and human rights for all”  former Secretary-General Kofi Annan said: “Our guiding light must be the needs and hopes of peoples everywhere” (A/59/2005  para. 12).  Such is the call and challenge staring the United Nations in the face: to ensure a peaceful  safe  dignified and prosperous world in our time and for posterity. "
"103",4248,"LTU",63,2008,"First  I would like to express my great respect to the leadership of the General Assembly as it guides the Organization through global issues and challenges.   When I stood at this podium 10 years ago  the list of issues to be urgently addressed was about the same  yet the mood was different. The Kyoto Protocol had just been signed and preparations for the Millennium Summit  including the drafting of the Millennium Development Goals  were under way. The international community  guided by the principles and the leadership of the United Nations  showed the will and the ambition to resolve global issues.   But did we manage to turn that collective will into principled and decisive actions? I have to admit that many nations  big and small  have many more concerns today than they did a decade ago. Today we feel less secure. The very structure of the international system seems to be fracturing  depriving us of the protection provided by international law and international institutions. In my region  in Eastern Europe and in the eastern neighbourhood of the European Union (EU)  that is more obvious than anywhere else.    7 08-51606   Take energy security: oil supplies to Lithuania have been cut off without warning  and we do not stand a chance of conducting a normal civilized dialogue on how to fix the problem. Gas supplies were interrupted to our neighbours Ukraine and Belarus. In that light  and on the eve of closing down our only independent power generator  we have very serious reason to worry about the possible risks for the future of our economy. I would also say that other countries of our region also have concerns about unreliable energy supplies. Such a situation threatens the stability of the entire region. The United Nations cannot be a mere passive observer if  and when  universal values and international law are under threat. Too often  we remain observers in the face of mounting security crises.   What happened to Georgia a few months ago is a case in point. The United Nations largely failed to react to an act of aggression against a small nation that has been a Member of the United Nations since 1992. Perhaps we failed to react because one of the interested sides to the conflict is a permanent member of the Security Council  which has the responsibility to protect both the letter and the spirit of the Charter of the United Nations and various United Nations resolutions.  But maybe we also failed to react because our faith in the United Nations has weakened. It is the very essence of the Organization’s mission to protect human life and human rights  but too often voting on human rights receives less and less support from Member States. Today  there are still about 26 million internally displaced persons in the world  including in the Sudan  Somalia  the South Caucasus nations of Georgia and Azerbaijan  and other places. Last year alone  we faced serious crises in different corners of the planet  including in Myanmar  the Sudan and Zimbabwe. The world needed United Nations leadership  but the Organization has not acted accordingly. That is because some States hide behind technicalities or the shield of national sovereignty  thereby paralysing the United Nations.  It is quite evident that the United Nations cannot continue with business as usual. It needs reform and a greater role in areas that will determine the future of the twenty-first century  such as energy  information security  anti-terrorism  the fight against fundamentalism and the like. How long will we continue with cold-war-era security definitions  closing our eyes to the less visible  but no less dangerous dangers of the twenty-first century? When 17 years ago  following the Soviet occupation  my country regained independence and joined the United Nations  we were told that never again would Molotovs and Ribbentrops dare to decide the future of other nations. Next year we will mark the seventieth anniversary of the shameful Molotov-Ribbentrop secret protocols.   But Lithuania and other nations of the former Soviet Union still have to fight against the revisionism seeping down from the Kremlin’s towers and the blatant claims that there was no occupation of the Baltic States and that there was no Holodomor in Ukraine  where millions of people were starved to death by a ruthless dictator. Should not an alarm bell ring across the entire international community when we see such bold attempts to cover up crimes against humanity?  Today  my nation is commemorating the Day of Genocide of Lithuanian Jews. That tragedy is a powerful reminder to us all of the vulnerability of freedom  but it also teaches us that sincere efforts to admit one’s crimes help nations to reconcile and create a truly peaceful  secure and stable area. Therefore  on this solemn day we not only remember but we also learn.  If we are to reform the United Nations in a meaningful way  perhaps we should have a better look at the experience of European nations after the end of the Second World War and the end of the cold war. Based on that experience  it is obvious that we need to strengthen democracy at home in order to have good governance and responsible leadership. Perhaps responsible leaders will not protect us from all global challenges  but they will at least seek cooperation with their people and other nations to resolve their persisting problems.  It is only through integration that truly indivisible security can be achieved. Indivisible security has special meaning and importance for smaller nations  which have all too often fallen victim to the redrawing of maps. It is my conviction that the interaction of  and cooperation among  different organizations — like the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe  EU  NATO and the Council of Europe — have been  and should remain  the foundation for security and stability in Europe. There are difficulties and deficiencies; but there is no alternative  and new alternatives are not needed. I am therefore deeply    08-51606 8  worried by new calls to revise the institutional structure of European security  rather than to abide by commitments undertaken before the whole international community.  Security based on cooperation should remain the basic principle of different European organizations and of international relations as a whole. The philosophy of the balance of power  which is again growing popular in some capitals  has no place in contemporary Europe. And because security is indivisible  it is in the interest of the international community that the United Nations should play a greater role in strengthening preventive diplomacy and making the principle of the responsibility to protect work.  The United Nations also has to be more responsive to emerging threats  such as unreliable energy supplies  fundamentalism and cyber attacks. It does not matter if the world is unipolar  bipolar or multipolar. Human life and human rights remain at the heart of our world. Only such a world can create a truly viable architecture among States — an architecture based on trust  openness and respect for human rights. But did we see efforts to create such an architecture in the Georgia-Russia conflict? What we saw instead were renewed attempts to divide the world into zones of influence or privileged interests. That should be unacceptable to the international community in the twenty-first century. Division and exclusion are bad remedies for conflict resolution. Conflict resolution in South Ossetia  Abkhazia and elsewhere should therefore be the responsibility of the international community and international institutions  not of one participating side  which hardly remains impartial.  We also have to maintain commitments to value-based policies. It is through our commitment to change and reform that Lithuania has become what it is today: a consolidated democracy  a strong reformed economy and an active contributor to international peacekeeping missions from the Balkans to Afghanistan.  I believe that we  the peoples of the United Nations  have to renew our commitment to universal values and principles  so that we march together and in the same direction and our steps become stronger. I believe that we must learn those lessons well  so that in another 10-years’ time we can celebrate not only the fulfilled promise of the Millennium Development Goals but also the fulfilled promise of creating lasting peace and an era of progress  prosperity and human integrity. It is because the United Nations consists primarily not of the sum total of votes but of universal principles that those principles shall be a guiding light for us in the years to come. I still believe that that is the core mission of the Organization. I care deeply about it. "
"104",4292,"LUX",63,2008,"“[We] will not enjoy development without security  we will not enjoy security without development  and we will not enjoy either without respect for human rights” (A/59/2005  para. 17). In this year when we celebrate the sixtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  that fundamental observation by former Secretary-General Kofi Annan continues to be as relevant as ever  and it must continue to guide our actions and those of our Organization and our Governments.  I should like briefly to recall the two high-level events that we have attended in the past few days: that on Africa’s development needs and that on the Millennium Development Goals. Those meetings showed that some progress has been made — and there has been unquestionable progress that must be acknowledged: for example  we have seen a drop of 400 million in the number of people living in extreme poverty  a drop of 27 per cent in the mortality rate of children under the age of five  increased investments in education and health and progress regarding gender equality. But they also emphasized the absolute need to strengthen our efforts if we want to achieve the goals that we set ourselves by consensus in 2000  all the more since the rise in food and fuel prices and the slowing of the world economy that we have seen in recent months threaten our achievements.   41 08-52265   Luxembourg has resolutely focussed its cooperation policy on the eradication of poverty  particularly in the least developed countries. Its actions are conceived in the spirit of sustainable development  including its social  economic and environmental aspects  with men  women and children at their core. Today  my country spends 0.92 per cent of its gross national income on official development assistance  and we expect to continue on that track in order to achieve the goal of 1 per cent in the coming years. Together with others  we shall invest our efforts to ensure that the commitments entered into 2005 at the European level are fully respected at the Doha Conference on Financing for Development.   While establishing a true development partnership must be based on shared responsibilities by donor and recipient countries  and while we are counting on strengthened action by developing countries with regard to good governance  the rule of law  capacity-building and ownership of their own development  respect by developed countries of their commitments regarding the quality and quantity of assistance is an important basis for such a partnership  particularly with respect to Africa. Nevertheless  I would like to recall that the European Union and its member States account for 55 to 60 per cent of global worldwide development assistance.  I would not like to omit a subject that was at the centre of our discussions last year and that has a major impact on the potential of countries’ development: climate change. It is essential to continue along the course started in Bali and to conclude in Copenhagen a post-Kyoto regime that does not impede  but rather supports  the sustainable economic development to which the developing countries aspire. Mechanisms making an effective transfer of technology possible and appropriate financing available are  in our view  indispensable tools for the post-2012 regime  with respect to both mitigation and adaptation as part and parcel of an effective global multilateral regime  with legally binding emission reduction targets for industrialized countries and with contributions by each according to their means.   Luxembourg  for its part  decided at the beginning of the year to systematically integrate the question of adaptation to climate change into its development programmes.   However  climate change has a potential impact not only on development but on the security of countries. The initiatives of small developing Pacific island countries to refer this issue to the Assembly seems to me most timely. It favourably complements the initiative by the Maldives at the seventh session of the Human Rights Council to take up the relationship between climate change and the full enjoyment of human rights. As I have already had the opportunity to say from this rostrum  to successfully take on climate change we must tackle it in all its complexity and face it in a concerted manner. What better framework to do so than the United Nations?  Since development needs  particularly in Africa  have been at the centre of our attention this week  allow me to say a few words about some of the conflicts in Africa which impede the development of the countries they are ravaging  and in whose solution the United Nations is heavily invested — unfortunately not always with the desired results.   The conflict of Darfur is in its sixth year now  and images of people devastated by attacks  displacement  precarious life in the camps and the daily fear of fresh violence continue to haunt the media  and also our minds. International efforts and efforts of the United Nations to resolve the crisis  particularly through joint deployment with the African Union of the largest peacekeeping mission ever decided on  and the central role of mediation in the search for a political solution may continue to be in vain if the parties to the conflict  blinded by their short-term interests  continue to lack the necessary political will to commit themselves to a lasting solution.   For a solution to Darfur to be lasting  it must comprise a number of components: security  by cessation of hostilities and a return to calm on the ground; political  by the conclusion of an agreement for the sharing of power and resources; humanitarian  through effective measures to respond to immediate humanitarian needs and development needs of the population; and judicial  of course  by the end of the widespread impunity for the crimes committed in Darfur and bringing to justice the main perpetrators of the atrocities there to make a true reconciliation possible. Peace and justice should go hand in hand in Darfur  just as throughout the world. That is one of the fundamental principles that guide Luxembourg’s foreign policy. We cannot  nor should we  close our eyes to the serious crimes committed in Darfur. Any    08-52265 42  political solution that would indefinitely put off justice in Darfur would be flouting even further the rights of a population that has been suffering for too long.  The European Union and my own country are endeavouring to make their contribution with the deployment of the European Union force (EUFOR) in Chad and the Central African Republic  a force charged with protecting the refugees of Darfur as well as internally displaced persons  and allowing the humanitarian community access to those vulnerable people in a volatile security environment. EUFOR must pave the path for a United Nations force starting in the spring of next year. It is important that this transition occur under good circumstances  according to the timetable  and that the force can deploy fully  in the interest of achieving lasting stability in the subregion.  Another conflict in Africa which concerns us greatly is the one in Somalia. Somalia has been in the grips of civil war for more than a generation now  and the consequences are felt throughout the entire region of the Horn of Africa. The signing of the Djibouti agreement several weeks ago between the Transitional Government and an opposition party will perhaps open the way to a lasting stabilization of Somalia. Only by consolidating the political situation and improving security can the international community fully carry out its peacekeeping efforts in that country in the wake of the African Union  which has deployed a peacekeeping force under extremely trying circumstances. I welcome the efforts under way in the Security Council to give concrete form  when conditions permit  to the firm commitment entered into by the international community and the United Nations to help Somalia.  Much more could  indeed  be said about the situation in Africa. We are concerned over the Democratic Republic of the Congo  where fighting has recently resumed. In Zimbabwe  one must hope that all forms of intimidation and violence will now be ended so that that battered country can recover. However  more could also be said about the positive developments in Liberia and Sierra Leone  where it has been possible to put in place an integrated strategy for peacebuilding and to draw up a reliable way out of the crisis.  The sum of $700 billion has been at the centre of concerns over financial policy this week. It appears that this staggering sum has been deployed in order to repair the damage of the capitalism of the casino-like banking sector that relies on debt and speculation to achieve precarious growth. Imagine  for a moment  this sum being applied to achieve the Millennium Development Goals upheld by this Assembly in 2000 and 2005. Millions of children could survive. Millions of women would not die during or after childbirth. Much progress could be made against AIDS and malaria  or in education and training programmes for millions of poor people who live on one or two dollars a day. Take a moment to reflect on this.  I also want to mention another topic which concerns us a great deal  one where our Organization  in cooperation with the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the European Union  should play a central role  namely  the conflicts in Georgia.  As the President of the French Republic  representing the European Union  said a few days ago from this rostrum  the European Union wants to act for peace. It is prepared to make its contribution  particularly by deploying an on-the-ground observer mission  and in the international discussions that should begin in mid-October in Geneva  with a view to a peaceful and lasting solution. Such a solution should be based on full respect for principles of independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity  and we condemn any action at odds with those principles. Additionally  we feel it is important to see that an independent investigation be carried out on the Georgian conflict.  It is said that war kills truth first. The European Union has committed itself to stopping the violence and getting the troops out of Georgia  which will undoubtedly help the Georgian people in both humanitarian and security terms. The real reasons for the outbreak of this conflict cannot be left to historians. Light must be shed on the situation. Therefore and most importantly  in order to avoid similar cases in the future  the raison d’être of the United Nations is to prevent the outbreak of armed conflict. If a conflict arises it is incumbent on all of us to investigate the reasons and the circumstances in order to prevent other clashes.  I also want to share what was said by the President of the European Council regarding another topic  particularly after having heard the statement last Tuesday of the President of the Islamic Republic of   43 08-52265  Iran before the General Assembly (see ). It is intolerable that Iran should call for the destruction of the State of Israel. We cannot tolerate such anti-Semitic comments  particularly from this rostrum here in our Organization.  As so often  shadows of darkness and rays of hope become intermingled when we analyse international situations  but one constant remains true: the importance of an effective multilateral system.  The United Nations could be even more effective if it were to continue its internal reform efforts. Unfortunately  there is a certain fatigue with regard to reform of the Organization. This is particularly regrettable because global challenges cannot wait. A more cohesive and effective Organization would benefit us all. Let us not hesitate to redouble our efforts to honour our reform commitments of 2005.  With regard to the reform of the Security Council  I am pleased that we are finally going to begin intergovernmental negotiations at the beginning of 2009. I hope that those negotiations will quickly achieve results. I also hope that the reformed Council will be more representative  but above all  I hope that it will perform better and be more transparent  thereby ensuring greater effectiveness and enhanced legitimacy and implementation of its decisions.  Other areas of reform agreed in 2005  such as the management of the Organization  have not yet been addressed. I therefore encourage the Secretary-General to pursue his effort to reform human resources management on the basis of the three pillars of transparency  effectiveness and the taking of responsibility.   With regard to system-wide coherence  we should pursue our efforts in the areas of operational activities  commercial practices and environmental initiatives. We must essentially move away from the fragmented system that has evolved in the course of the past 60 years of United Nations history.  In conclusion  I think it very important to once again draw the Assembly’s attention to our collective decision regarding the responsibility to protect people against genocide  war crimes  ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. We should continue to work on the concept of the responsibility to protect  which should be implemented in the framework of criteria and conditions set out in the final document of the 2005 Summit (resolution 60/1)  so as to progressively establish an irrefutable basis upon which the international community can act in accordance with a given situation.   As a founding Member of the Organization  my country endeavours to contribute to the purposes and principles of the Charter through resolute and ongoing solidarity  through concrete involvement in efforts aimed at development  peace  security and respect for human rights  and through the determined pursuit of a multilateral approach with the United Nations at the core. It is in that same spirit that  as we did in 2001  Luxembourg has presented its candidacy for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council for the period 2013 and 2014. That too is how we intend to continue to shoulder our share of responsibility in this Assembly.  "
"105",4318,"LVA",63,2008,"I wish to begin by congratulating Mr. d’Escoto Brockmann on assuming the post of President of the General Assembly at its current session.  Today I shall start by addressing the security situation in the world. During the past year  the international community has deepened its understanding of frozen conflicts. Frozen does not mean resolved; it means that those conflicts are able to re-emerge. Therefore  I am particularly glad that significant progress has been achieved towards resolving long-lasting conflicts in some regions.  First  I would like to mention Kosovo. Strong involvement by the United Nations  the European Union (EU) and the United States helped to resolve a protracted conflict in the Balkans. Now we need to focus our efforts on the development of Kosovo’s statehood: political stability  economic prosperity  security and good relations with its neighbours.  I welcome the decision of the Secretary-General to reconfigure the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo. It is necessary to continue the constructive cooperation between the United Nations and the EU so that the Kosovo Mission can be fully deployed. That is important both for Kosovo and for the entire West Balkans region.  The international community has also made remarkable efforts to assist Afghanistan in building a democratic  prosperous and secure State. Large and small countries and civilian and military organizations from all over the world are working together to fulfil our common aspiration to peace and stability.  We must not undermine that immense effort by being impatient. The war ravaged Afghanistan for  20 years; it will take at least as much time to rebuild a peaceful society. The international community must push ahead until that long-term aim is achieved.  Latvia is increasing its commitment to the Afghan people in terms of development and security assistance. We are focusing our civil engagement on ensuring good governance and a strong judiciary and on meeting the basic needs of the Afghan people.  The prospects for peace and stability in the Middle East affect the whole world. Latvia hopes that the peace negotiations between the Government of Israel and the Palestinian Authority will produce results. We hope that the parties will use the window of opportunity to conclude a peace agreement by the end of 2008. The indirect talks that have resumed between Israel and Syria are another positive signal.   Latvia welcomes the stabilization process in Lebanon. We hope that the Doha agreement will be fully implemented and that it will serve as a solid foundation for renewed political stability  national unity and sustainable economic development in the country.  Not all of the developments over the past year have been positive. We have witnessed new challenges to the law-based international system. We should ask ourselves whether we  as the international community  can accept the fact that peacekeeping troops protect only one side involved in a conflict. Can we accept the fact that peacekeeping forces are occupying territories that are clearly outside the conflict zones? Can we accept the fact that the protection of nationals abroad is being used as a pretext for a large-scale use of force in another State without the approval of the Security Council?  All those questions arise from the international response to the recent war in Georgia. If they matter to us  we should have a clear plan to resolve the Georgian crisis. The most important task is adherence to and implementation of the six-point ceasefire agreement on the part of the Russian Federation. First  foreign troops must be removed from all Georgian soil. Equally important is the establishment of an EU monitoring mission to normalize the situation in Georgia.  For 15 years now  the United Nations has mandated the United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia. We must ensure that there are no obstacles to the continuation of that effort. I call upon world leaders to come together not only to provide humanitarian aid to Georgia  but also to ensure a massive international effort to help rebuild the country’s economy and infrastructure.   It is about time that we seriously examine our development commitments. The time between now and 2015 may seem long  but it is less than the time that has elapsed since the adoption of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in 2000. Two days ago  I   17 08-51839  participated in the high-level meeting on Africa’s development needs  and tomorrow I will participate in the high-level event on the MDGs. Those are important efforts aimed at giving the issue the top priority that it deserves. We must significantly accelerate the processes for achieving the MDGs by 2015. A clearer picture of what we must achieve in the interim in each of the main clusters of the MDGs — health  education  growth and climate change — is what the United Nations needs immediately.  We also need a clearer picture of the required division of labour among various actors  and we need to develop a shared sense of progress. A clear plan of action is what we need right now. Therefore  Latvia strongly supports the EU Call for Action initiative on the MDGs. Climate change will have a major negative bearing on the achievement of the MDGs. Latvia supports broader use of renewable energy resources to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. However  climate change cannot be seen as an exclusively environmental challenge; we need a more integrated approach.  Changes to energy consumption patterns must be taken into account as we move towards sustainable development  food security and worldwide trade. Innovative technologies  as well as sustainable production and consumption  would deliver both midterm and long-term results. Carbon dioxide emissions cannot be cut in some regions while others do nothing. While each of our countries must commit to cutting emissions  success will be possible only if there is a truly global agreement that enables us to do so and tells us how. The United Nations  as the only truly global Organization  must play a decisive role.  Trade liberalization is an important contributor to the achievement of the MDGs. Although the recent trade liberalization efforts at the World Trade Organization were not successful  the process must be continued at the multilateral level.  Globalization has brought with it both increased prosperity and increased risks. We need to find a way to ensure that tomorrow’s globalization will offer growing prosperity to all people. Globalization will produce benefits on a truly global scale only if trade is liberalized across the board. Every country and every region must do its fair share in that process.  I would like to congratulate Ms. Navanethem Pillay  the new United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights  on the assumption of her duties and to wish her every success in that highly important post. I would also like to thank Ms. Louise Arbour for her invaluable contribution to the promotion and protection of human rights.  This year  symbolically  the sixtieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights coincides with the ninetieth anniversary of the founding of the Republic of Latvia. In 1918  the Act of Proclamation of the Republic of Latvia declared:   “All citizens  irrespective of their ethnicity  are asked to help  for the rights of all people will be guaranteed in Latvia. It will be a democratic and just State where oppression and injustice do not exist”.  I am truly proud of that statement. Thirty years before the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  the Republic of Latvia declared its adherence to the same core values and principles and fully implemented them in the newly established State.  Unfortunately  by the time the Universal Declaration of Human Rights had been adopted  Latvia had come under foreign occupation and its people had been deprived of their right to freely determine their political status and were being subjected to oppression and injustice. It was only in 1991 that Latvia restored its statehood and the continuity of its commitment to fundamental human rights  inherent human dignity  equality and the universality of those values.  The creation of the Human Rights Council and the beginning of the Universal Periodic Review are important steps aimed at promoting the values of the Universal Declaration. The special procedures of the Human Rights Council play a particular role in that regard. Latvia expresses its full support for them and urges all United Nations Members to cooperate fully with the special procedures  including by issuing standing invitations to them.  Latvia is ready to share with the international community its experience in the area of promoting human rights. Latvia has put forward its candidacy for the Human Rights Council for the year 2014.  This year marks the tenth anniversary of the adoption of the Rome Statute establishing the International Criminal Court (ICC). We welcome the progress the Court has achieved in its analyses  investigations and judicial proceedings. We call upon    08-51839 18  all States to ensure full cooperation with the Court. The ICC is not an instrument that can be activated or deactivated according to political expediency. We are convinced that universality of justice is a prerequisite for sustainable peace.  Effective multilateralism requires combining greater awareness of the nature of the risks we face with a contemporary understanding of how international politics are forged today. International organizations are only one part of our global system  and often that part is the most resistant to change. It is regrettable that the enthusiasm and momentum generated during the 2005 World Summit in reforming this universal international body has somewhat faded.  Reform of the Security Council is long overdue. We must move on from the discussion of procedure into a discussion of substance. We welcome the recent decision by the General Assembly to continue immediately within the Open-ended Working Group on the Question of Equitable Representation on and Increase in the Membership of the Security Council and Other Matters Related to the Security Council to prepare intergovernmental negotiations on the question of the Security Council’s expansion.   While recognizing the need for structural reform of the United Nations  we should not lose sight of making more effective use of existing capacity. Management reform is central to all those efforts. We support further measures aimed at ensuring greater transparency  enhanced accountability and strict budget discipline. There has been some progress  but not enough by far.  We live in a world with deteriorating security  a growing population  the consequences of climate change and market turbulence aggravated by high energy and food prices. We need deeper engagement with the risks we face globally. That requires a new commitment to our values and a willingness to work for an international system that has a vision of the future at its heart. I would like that to become the driving force for all the work of the General Assembly at this sixty-third session. "
"106",4365,"MAR",63,2008,"Allow me to begin by warmly congratulating His Excellency Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann upon his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-  17 08-52265  third session. His election honours his long-lasting personal commitment to the preservation of peace and security and  particularly  his constant efforts to encourage reconciliation in Central America. I also wish to thank Mr. Srgjan Kerim for his excellent service as President of the General Assembly at its previous session.   I would also like to thank the Secretary-General  Ban Ki-moon  for his generous and ongoing efforts to help reform our Organization  in particular those aiming to improve its working methods and its interaction with its Member States.   Twenty years ago  the fall of the Berlin Wall marked the end of a cold war era that had been characterized by ideological divisions  arms races and a weak multilateral system with inefficient mechanisms. With the end of that era came great hope and aspirations from the world’s peoples  leading some to believe in the beginning of a new world order — a world order that would not only be more fair and equitable  but also distinguished by a culture of forgiveness among its nations. That new order was also meant to spread the values of democracy and human rights  giving priority to development and the better and more efficient utilization of technological advancements. At the same time  some people predicted that that new world order would restore prestige to the United Nations  allowing it to achieve more consensus on international issues.   Rather than fulfilling the expectations of a better world after the cold war  today’s reality has seen an increase in regional and internal conflicts  especially on the African continent. This situation is exacerbated by a race for energy resources and a frenzied exploitation of precious minerals.   At the economic and trade levels  the launch of the World Trade Organization in 1994 in Marrakesh led to a substantial acceleration of world trade exchanges  but it did not create a fair trade system that would respond to the expectations of developing countries.   Indeed  in spite of the efforts deployed in numerous United Nations conferences  official development assistance (ODA) has significantly decreased over recent years. In fact  the assistance provided by donor countries does not meet the expectations of developing countries despite the former’s commitment to increase their global annual assistance to developing countries to $50 billion by 2010.   Therefore  notwithstanding the progress achieved over previous years  Morocco  in addition to other countries  expresses its concern regarding the delay in the launching of development processes in many African countries. That delay is partly due to the complexity of the current international situation particularly marked by economic and financial crises  which have had an impact on food security and the energy needs of these countries. Those circumstances undermine years of ongoing efforts towards the development of African countries. In order to improve that situation  the Kingdom of Morocco urges the United Nations and relevant financial institutions to undertake all the arrangements necessary to stabilize the food market  to maintain social stability in developing countries and to open the market to agricultural products  taking into consideration the circumstances of the least developed countries.   The weak role of the United Nations in maintaining peace and security throughout the world during the cold war period was followed by a new phase  during which the multilateral system was characterized by the convening of several meetings and conferences focused on various global issues  as well as by the deployment of numerous peacekeeping operations  especially in Africa. As a troop-contributing country  Morocco has spared no efforts to increase its involvement in United Nations peacekeeping forces. The Kingdom is also actively promoting the enhancement of South-South cooperation by giving priority to African countries.   To parallel the changes taking place in the international arena  United Nations Member States launched major reforms centred on improving the Organization’s actions  reinforcing its role and enhancing its mechanisms. Nevertheless  some weaknesses remain in coordination among the various United Nations bodies and between the Organization itself and regional organizations. That is particularly evident in the efforts to contain and prevent regional conflicts with potential spillover effects.   At this point  it is important to strengthen multilateralism in order to meet new challenges and to put in place a new order based on justice and equality. The pursuit of such an approach is not merely an option but is necessary  given the serious challenges    08-52265 18  facing international peace and security and sustainable economic and social development.  The Middle East peace process  initiated at the Madrid Conference in 1991  was unfortunately unsuccessful in ending the conflict  which continues to see heavy daily casualties and causes millions of Palestinians to live in inhumane and tragic conditions. In this context Morocco closely follows the latest developments regarding the situation in the Middle East and encourages all initiatives aiming to bring peace to that region  with respect to international legality and to the agreements previously reached  namely the Road Map and the Arab Peace Initiative.   This last initiative undoubtedly represents a realistic solution  reflecting the true commitment of Arab countries to reach a just  comprehensive and lasting solution that would allow the Palestinian people to establish an independent State with Al-Quds as its capital and force Israel to withdraw from all occupied Arab land  a solution that would enable the people and the countries of the Middle East to live in peace  stability and security.   The Kingdom of Morocco equally expresses the necessity to respect the particular situation of Jerusalem by avoiding degrading and humiliating practices and curtailing any attempts to undermine the specificities of the Holy City in regard to culture  religion and civilization. In this regard  His Majesty King Mohammed VI  Chairman of the Al-Quds Committee  spares no effort in encouraging world leaders to help put an end to the projects taking place around the Al-Aqsa Mosque and in other parts of Jerusalem.   As far as Iraq is concerned  we closely follow progress on the ground and encourage dialogue and national reconciliation between the different ethnic  political and cultural factions in order to end the cycle of violence  to reach peace and stability  to preserve the territorial integrity of that brotherly country and to allow it to rebuild its economy.   Morocco also launched a regional initiative in June 2006 by convening an international ministerial conference on migration  development  environment and climate change. Morocco considers the celebration of the sixtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights the right occasion to appoint a United Nations special rapporteur on human rights issues. It would aim to appropriately equip the United Nations to play a leading role in ensuring that all citizens’ rights are protected and that the laws and political and economic mechanisms regarding respect for human rights are harmonized in order to promote those rights.   The United Nations is based on the principles of cooperation and neighbourly relations  with regional integration and cooperation representing the best means to ensure stability  economic development and an improved collective future. Since its independence  the Kingdom of Morocco has placed the project of an Arab Maghreb Union at the top of its priorities and considered it a strategic option. Morocco is firmly committed to making the Arab Maghreb Union the herald of an era of peace and the fulfilment of the common destiny of the populations of this region.   The Kingdom of Morocco is strongly convinced about and deeply committed to overcoming all obstacles and to moving forward with regional integration into the Arab Maghreb Union. The Moroccan autonomy initiative regarding the Western Sahara  which was described by the Security Council as serious and credible  is the result of in-depth national consultations and widespread international consultations. As a result  the Security Council successfully and unanimously adopted three resolutions — 1754 (2007)  1783 (2007) and 1813 (2008) — that call upon parties to enter into true negotiations  taking into consideration the latest developments and particularly the Moroccan initiative  which launched a new dynamic in favour of a lasting solution to this conflict.  Morocco remains strongly committed to continuing those negotiations with sincerity and goodwill in order to find a final solution to that regional conflict  one that would respect the national sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Morocco and give the benefits of autonomy to the Sahara and its population. It would be a lasting  comprehensive and realistic solution to that regional conflict.   A strong  open  integrated and stable Arab Maghreb can play a key role in maintaining regional peace and security. Along the shores of the Mediterranean  it can also contribute to enhancing African integration and play an active role as an efficient and credible partner to achieve the noble goals for which the United Nations was created.

"107",4389,"MCO",63,2008,"Allow me at the outset to convey to the President my congratulations on his election and to acknowledge  through him  the Latin American and Caribbean States that made his presidency of the General Assembly possible. Let me assure him and the other Assembly officers that my delegation will support them throughout the sixty-third session of the General Assembly.   I also wish to thank the Secretary-General for his resolute action in favour of peace and reiterate to him our sincere and full support.  Finally  allow me to state what a great honour it is for me to take the floor today for the first time at the rostrum of this prestigious Hall.  The great and deeply missed poet Aimé Césaire said: “A civilization that is unable to resolve the problems that beset it is a decadent civilization.” We know what the sufferings of our civilization are. We have identified the solutions needed to treat them. The issue at stake here is implementing those solutions.  Eight years ago  in this very Hall  all the States Members of the United Nations adopted the Millennium Declaration  the decisive tool in the fight against poverty  to promote peace  security and human rights  and to ensure a sustainable environment. It provided the framework for eight precise goals accompanied by clear time frames — the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).  My message today is a simple one. The international community cannot afford to fail in the implementation of the MDGs  in spite of the threefold food  energy and environmental crisis seriously affecting the whole planet. To achieve the goals that we set ourselves at the dawn of the new millennium  we will have to step up our efforts and pursue concerted action in the only universal forum we have — the United Nations.  Eight years ago  we drew up together a scorecard with quantified goals and defined the steps to be taken to reduce poverty  fight hunger in the world and combat pandemics. Eight years ago  the situation was very alarming; we could not have imagined that things were to get worse.   Since then  we have been faced with the energy crisis and increasingly scarce resources  the food crisis and soaring prices of basic food products  and the    08-53129 18  climate crisis resulting from the impact of human activities on the environment. Adding to that already very dark picture  we must now face the financial crisis  whose repercussions continue to be felt and whose full impact is yet to be seen.   Each country is suffering the consequences of those crises in a different way depending on its geography  its economy and its commercial and financial market exposure; and each country is attempting to face them with its own means. The Principality of Monaco  within its capabilities  has chosen to fight two of those crises — the food crisis and the climate crisis — with the resources at its disposal.  Much of the progress achieved in recent years in helping those populations suffering from hunger and malnutrition has been erased by soaring increases in the price of basic foodstuffs. Two billion human beings are seriously at risk even as world cereal production has reached a record high in 2008. The African continent  and in particular sub-Saharan Africa  with 60 per cent of its population affected by the crisis  is once again the worst-affected continent.  It remains nonetheless undeniable that the right to food is among the basic human rights. During the High-Level Conference in Rome last June  the international community adopted the Declaration on World Food Security: the Challenges of Climate Change and Bioenergy. Monaco fully supports the measures advocated in the Declaration and joins the call for the establishment of a world partnership centred on the High-Level Task Force on the Global Food Security Crisis.  A year ago  His Serene Highness Prince Albert II announced here his decision to substantially increase Monaco’s official development assistance (ODA). The Principality’s Government is sparing no effort to reach the target of allocating 0.7 per cent of its gross national income by 2015 by increasing our ODA by 25 per cent every year and focusing its actions on the least developed countries.   In 2008  22 countries  mainly located around the Mediterranean basin and in sub-Saharan Africa  have benefited from a development partnership with the Principality. In addition to that bilateral cooperation  Monaco contributes on a regular basis to large-scale programmes of the United Nations system  such as the World Food Programme  the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF)  the World Health Organization  the United Nations Development Programme and the United Nations Population Fund  whose expertise and structures facilitate the greatest assistance to the poorest populations.  Moreover  climate change and the imbalances it creates have a direct impact on the sustainability of our actions for development. The climate crisis  desertification and the shortage of water resources have exacerbated the food crisis.   Antoine de Saint Exupéry said: “We do not inherit the Earth from our parents; we borrow it from our children.” Pursuing that analogy  the international community is not allocating sufficient funds to repay that loan.  Under the leadership of our Head of State and in collaboration with the Prince Albert II Foundation  the Government has committed itself actively in the International Polar Year to raise awareness among as many people as possible of the consequences of global warming. In that regard  the Arctic ice cap deserves all our attention since it serves as both an indicator of the consequences of global warming and as a vector of climate change through its gradual disappearance.  Last year  when adopting the resolution on oceans and the law of the sea  member States expressed their deep concern over the vulnerability of the environment and the fragility of ecosystems of the polar regions  particularly the Arctic Ocean and the Arctic ice cap. At Monaco’s initiative  the decision on sustainable development of the Arctic region was adopted at the tenth special session of the Governing Council of the United Nations Environment Programme  which was held in the Principality in February 2008.  We will pursue our commitment to that cause in the coming months when Monaco will host meetings on the Arctic: the first in November 2008  organized by the French presidency of the European Union  and the second organized by UNESCO early next year. I would also note that the Principality has solemnly confirmed its interest in the polar regions by acceding to the Antarctic Treaty on 31 May  and that His Serene Highness Prince Albert II will join a scientific mission to Antarctica in January.  Notwithstanding the obstacles we have encountered on the road since 2000  we have to stay on track. Indeed  let us roll up our sleeves  consult each   19 08-53129  other and work together to multiply our forces and create genuine synergy.  I would like to reiterate here the deep commitment of the Principality of Monaco to the United Nations  the only genuinely universal organization  which has human rights and the promotion of dialogue among nations at its very core. The Charter of the United Nations guarantees the sovereign equality of States and the rule of law. Monaco has been a Member of the United Nations for 15 years. Since joining  our small Principality has covered a lot of ground on the international scene  becoming a member of the Council of Europe in 2004 and  very recently  joining the Union for the Mediterranean.  Without the United Nations  it is doubtful that human rights would have acquired their universal status  which today is indisputable. This year and next  many anniversaries remind us yet again of the essential role of the United Nations: the sixtieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration of the Rights of the Child  and the twentieth anniversary of the adoption of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.  The world has changed since the San Francisco Conference. Today  our task is to modernize the United Nations and ensure that its institutions adequately reflect our democratic principles and new geopolitical balances. As His Serene Highness Prince Albert II stated here last year  Monaco supports the expansion of the Security Council.  Only the combined efforts of all partners will allow us to make real progress in the fight against poverty  to promote health care and education  improve access to water and protect the environment. As indicated in the June 2008 recommendations of the MDG Africa Steering Group  the primary responsibility for achieving the MDGs remains with African Governments  which have shown tremendous leadership in recent years and launched ambitious programmes to attract the financial support of their development partners.  We have seen real progress since 2000  in particular in the area of health. Monaco  for its part  contributes to various WHO and UNICEF programmes and participates in efforts to combat HIV/AIDS  sickle cell anaemia  tuberculosis and malaria. However  the greatest national efforts  if made on an individual basis and without coordination  will not be enough to fight the scourges that affect our planet  and the African continent in particular.  The evaluation of ODA policies  the sharing of good practices  the coordination of development assistance  partnership with the private sector  microfinance and the pursuit of alternative revenue sources are all instruments that  together with the priority to be given to the central role of women in the economy  will enable us to achieve the Millennium Development Goals in the next seven years. "
"108",4414,"MDA",63,2008,"At the outset  I would like to congratulate His Excellency Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann on his election to the high and responsible position of the President of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session and to pledge our full support and assistance as Vice-President of the General Assembly.   Our world is facing major problems and challenges that demand a strengthened and revitalized Organization capable of addressing global issues. From that perspective  the Republic of Moldova fully supports the United Nations reform process in accordance with the main directions reflected in the final document of the 2005 World Summit (resolution 60/)1  subsequent initiatives of the Secretary-General and resolutions adopted on key aspects of the reform of the Organization’s structures and management.   We support strengthening the coordinating role of the Economic and Social Council in developing global economic and social policies  promoting dialogue and intensifying cooperation with international financial  economic and trade institutions and Governments in attaining the Millennium Development Goals  as well as the Council’s involvement in addressing humanitarian crisis situations and issues related to post-conflict reconstruction.  The decision to launch intergovernmental negotiations will bring a new impetus to Security Council reform and will stimulate and increase the efficiency of United Nations activities in the field of international security and peacekeeping  including through developing cooperation with regional organizations and Member States in identifying solutions to conflicts in different parts of the world.  The events that occurred in South Ossetia  Georgia  have proved once again that frozen conflicts generate instability and threaten regional and international security. The Republic of Moldova subscribed to the European Union (EU) declaration regarding the degradation of the situation in South Ossetia  delivered at the extraordinary meeting of the Permanent Council of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe on 8 August 2008  and calls for the full implementation of the peace plan mediated under the French presidency of the EU. At the same time  categorically rejecting all methods of settlement by force  including those used to ensure territorial integrity  the Moldovan Government does not consider that international recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia will stabilize the situation.  In the specific case of the Transdniestrian conflict  the Republic of Moldova acted and continues to act in accordance with the law on basic provisions of the special legal status of the localities on the left bank of the Nistru River which was adopted unanimously on 22 July 2005 and which provides for resolution of the Transdniestrian conflict by political means only.  Believing that demilitarization and democratization of the Transdniestrian region are essential to a viable resolution of the conflict  the President of the Republic of Moldova has advanced a number of initiatives on security for and confidence-building between both banks of the Nistru River.   A strategy for conflict resolution based on a complex approach consisting of packaged proposals for all conflict-related issues — political  economic  social and humanitarian — has been adopted. It envisages a special legal status for the Transdniestrian region that includes respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Moldova  consolidation of the neutrality status  withdrawal of foreign troops from the country’s territory and recognition of ownership rights and firm guarantees for the population.  At the same time  the activities of the European Union Border Assistance Mission to Moldova and Ukraine (EUBAM) and its close cooperation with the relevant institutions in charge of border management in both States have contributed to increased security and transparency at the border  which creates a more favourable atmosphere for settlement of the Transdniestrian conflict. At present our efforts  as well as those of mediators and observers  are directed to   7 08-53135  resuming negotiations in the Five plus two format with a view to a final resolution of that conflict.  The Assembly’s review meeting to assess the implementation of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy  on 4 September 2008  emphasized both the progress registered by the United Nations and its Member States during the last years and the deficiencies in the fight against international terrorism. In that context  I would like to reaffirm that as a party to 13 international conventions and other  regional and bilateral treaties in that field  the Government of the Republic of Moldova continues to take concrete steps in fighting terrorism in accordance with the provisions of those instruments  relevant Security Council resolutions and national documents  including the National Strategy for Preventing and Fighting Money- Laundering and Terrorism Funding.   The Republic of Moldova will further undertake all possible steps for contributing to United Nations actions in consolidating international legislation in the field of countering international terrorism  especially in view of the finalizing of the development and adoption of the comprehensive convention on international terrorism and organization of the high-level conference on terrorism under United Nations auspices. We consider that in the framework of those activities  increased attention should be given to the issues related to fighting terrorism that is fuelled by separatist tendencies that affect States’ sovereignty and territorial integrity.  Climate change is an inherent challenge for sustainable development. Global warming and its effects  including natural disasters and food and energy crises  have become major threats for the global population and for international security. After the terrible drought of last year — the consequences of which we are still overcoming — the Republic of Moldova was hit this summer by the most serious floods of the last two centuries  which affected over 10 000 hectares of agricultural and private lands  destroyed hundreds of houses and other buildings and caused damages exceeding $120 million.  We would like to express our gratitude for the assistance provided by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs by other specialized institutions  including the United Nations Development Programme and UNICEF  and by Member States to alleviate the consequences of the floods.  The Republic of Moldova fully supports the activity of the High-Level Task Force on the Global Food Security Crisis  established and headed by the Secretary-General. Development and implementation of a comprehensive plan for food security  in cooperation with relevant United Nations agencies and the Bretton Woods institutions  would constitute an important step for overcoming the food crisis.  The Government of the Republic of Moldova is undertaking concrete action with a view to reducing the impact of the food crisis on the situation in the country. At present  a national agriculture and food security programme is being developed. We consider that the high-level meeting on the Millennium Development Goals held on 25 September and the organization of annual meetings on monitoring the engagement and implementation of those goals constitute new and important opportunities for implementing the achievement of all internationally accepted development objectives. Their implementation is still possible in the majority of countries if consolidated actions directed towards concrete results are established and continuously sustained and developed until the year 2015.   The progress achieved with the support of the European Union (EU) in the implementation of the Moldova-EU Action Plan and in conforming the national standards to the European standards has opened new opportunities for the advancement of Moldovan-European relations. We highly appreciate the constructive cooperation with the EU in that process and continue to rely on the assistance of its member States in ensuring development and the gradual integration of our country into the European Union.  At the same time  we rely on the support and the opportunities offered by the United Nations and Member States with a view to promoting the political  social and economic policies of the country and its European integration aspirations and to ensuring settlement of the Transdniestrian conflict  withdrawal of foreign military troops and accomplishment of the development priorities of the country.  I would like to reiterate the attachment of the Republic of Moldova to the ideals of the United Nations and its commitment to continuously cooperate    08-53135 8  with Member States towards achieving the important objectives of the Organization.

"109",4458,"MDG",63,2008,"Eight years ago in this very Hall  we  the leaders of the world  solemnly adopted the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Three years ago  we reviewed the Goals to assess the progress made thus far. We realized    08-51570 26  that the Goals were in danger of not being attained by the year 2015  and we all acknowledged that we would be able to achieve them only through a considerable increase in our efforts.  Have we been able to deliver on those promises and commitments? I am afraid that we have not. In fact  the situation is more complex now than it was three years ago. We are facing a global food crisis  a global economic crisis and a global security crisis  with war and political hostilities spreading throughout the globe. In spite of efforts to reduce the divisions between the rich and the poor  the progress we have made so far on the MDGs has fallen far short of the targets we established.  Those global crises are of such importance that they are threatening to delay the achievement of the MDGs beyond 2015. It would be a major mistake if we were to do nothing to prevent that from happening. We must remain focused on the achievement of the MDGs. I highly appreciate the aid and assistance provided by donors and international organizations. Those institutions and their programmes are making a difference in the daily lives of people throughout Africa  including in Madagascar.  In Madagascar  for example  under-five mortality rates have dropped from 159 to 94 per 1 000. Primary school enrolment has increased from 67 per cent to more than 92 per cent. A million Malagasy have risen out of poverty in the past five years. None of that would have been possible without the support of the international community.  Unfortunately  official development assistance continues to shrink  while the aid provided by the international community remains insufficient. The target of 0.7 per cent of gross national income allocated to official development assistance was set with a view to achieving the MDGs in the developing countries. In his report on Africa’s development needs (A/63/130)  the Secretary-General rightly stresses that most of the wealthy donor nations have failed to deliver on their promises to help the world’s poorest countries. The same report estimates that donor countries must increase aid by $18 billion a year in order to honour their pledge to provide $50 billion dollars by 2010.  In Africa  we continue to bear the consequences of those broken promises. Africa cannot break the vicious cycle of poverty: families have difficulties feeding themselves and the number of families with access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation infrastructure is very small. I call upon all donor countries to honour their promises and to demonstrate leadership by explaining to their people why supporting the MDGs and the fight against poverty is a moral obligation and essential to creating a more stable and peaceful world.  We are all aware of the current world food crisis. For us and other countries  it is a heavy burden that poses many new challenges. The global food crisis is partly the result of the domestic agricultural subsidies and tariff protection practices of developed countries  which for many years have discouraged agricultural production in developing countries. In Africa  we find ourselves in very difficult circumstances. Because we have such low agricultural output  we are dependent on the global marketplace to feed our people. With commodity prices soaring  however  we cannot afford the basic food items needed to survive. We are in an unprecedented crisis. Rising food prices are pushing more people into absolute poverty.  The international community needs to take urgent and coordinated action to counter the negative impacts of increasing food prices on poor and vulnerable countries. Global trade policies must foster food security for all. Developed countries must reform their agricultural subsidy policies and amend the strategies and practices that increase the volatility of international prices. The international community must also help African countries to expand agriculture and to strengthen agricultural investment and the infrastructure needed for rural development.  The new agricultural development strategies must address the need for environmental management  sustainable development and the resistance of crops to disease and climate change. Given the impact of global climate change  maintaining healthy biodiversity is critical to sustaining future production performance.  Small subsistence farmers  representing 80 per cent of Africa’s population  are key to its development. We must support them through a variety of programmes focused on training  access to finance and equipment  and marketing and distribution processes. Those small subsistence farmers must be an integral part of  and benefit from  a new model of agricultural production  economic development and environmental management. In that regard  I appreciate the true value   27 08-51570  of the new dynamic of the Food and Agricultural Organization’s pragmatic approach.   I would like to speak about what we are doing in Madagascar to address the challenge of food security. Our chief intention is to make Madagascar’s agriculture more productive  more sustainable and more open to innovation and entrepreneurship  as the initiative Future Farmers of Madagascar shows.   For example  we are promoting the widespread use of the System of Rice Intensification  developed in Madagascar in the 1980s  an eco-friendly method of production that is an important part of the natural revolution  recently launched in Madagascar. That revolution is based on sustaining our natural resources and maintaining an ecological balance. It respects the soil  the environment and the people. At the moment  as rice is the staple food of the people of Madagascar  we are trying to keep the domestic rice price at an affordable level to protect the most vulnerable layers of the population.   In addition to that food crisis  we are confronted with other important challenges: climate change  increasing energy prices  unpredictable financial markets and other threats to our peace and security. What are the consequences of those threats and challenges?   First  those threats have a severe impact on the education  health and well-being of the population. In short  they have a very negative impact on our development. Secondly  those challenges are now competing with the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Many of the resources dedicated to achieving the MDGs are now being directed elsewhere. They are being used to reconstruct countries destroyed by war or that have collapsed as a result of social conflicts. They are also being used to stabilize the food markets  meet energy demands and tackle climate change issues.   I understand that countries devastated by wars and other armed conflicts  by environmental disasters or by famine need assistance. I understand  and I support reforestation efforts and the need for new hydro-energy plants. What I do not understand  however  is that all those challenges and threats offer reasons for countries to abdicate on their promises of doubled aid for education  health and infrastructure  in order to achieve the MDGs in developing countries  especially in Africa.   For that reason  I have repeatedly stressed the importance of international assistance  especially the need to increase  improve and better coordinate that assistance  if donors are to meet their previously agreed pledges. There are links between the MDGs and the political  economic  environmental and other challenges I have mentioned. Therefore  more investment towards achieving the MDGs will contribute to addressing those challenges. In fact  improving the situation of the most dominated is one of the best means to solve them.   However  we must realize that those challenges will not be solved by simply shifting resources from one problem to another. It is clear that those other challenges require additional resources and a better coordination of efforts. Africa has been hit harder than any other continent by the food crisis  by higher energy prices  by environmental degradation  by disease and by social and political destabilization. That is why I would like once again to reiterate the need for a new Marshall Plan for Africa.   It seems that many world leaders  and public opinion  have forgotten or neglected the MDGs. We cannot fill one group’s basket with the advantages of globalization while we empty the basket of another through the cost of globalization. It is increasingly clear that domestic interests are serviced at the cost of international needs. The outcome of the latest round of the World Trade Organization proved that. The lack of shared decision-making power in international institutions and global forums is a significant obstacle to making progress in developing countries and to achieving the MDGs. I would like to see a United Nations that can mobilize the resources and political will to tackle the toughest of problems — and succeed.  I am optimistic. I believe that we can turn the situation around. I appeal to you as leaders of the world. Everyone needs to contribute more goodwill  more motivation  more technical assistance  more coordinated efforts and  above all  more financial resources to the international basket. If you want to do so  if we are all committed to doing so  we shall be able to confront those crises together and achieve the Millennium Development Goals  and I am sure that we are going to win.   The recent fourth Tokyo International Conference on African Development provides an encouraging and promising example of our partners’ commitment and    08-51570 28  willingness to advance the development agenda of Africa and to achieve the MDGs. More and more foundations  such as the Gates  Rockefeller  MacArthur  Better U and Clinton Foundations  and others  are playing a vital role in Africa. All those initiatives are much appreciated.   Madagascar has embarked on the path of transformation. To accelerate and better coordinate our development process and to make a quantum leap forward  we have created the Madagascar Action Plan  or MAP. It is a bold and ambitious  five-year plan that aims to promote rapid growth  lead to the reduction of poverty and ensure that the country develops in response to the challenges of globalization and in accordance with the national vision  Madagascar Naturally  and with the Millennium Development Goals. To implement the plan we have mobilized the whole population  whose active participation strengthens its sense of national pride and country ownership.   To help it move further on that path and to achieve the MDGs  the international community must double its efforts in Madagascar. For our part  we are resolved to assume our responsibilities  build trust with our partners  strengthen our capacities  promote democracy and good governance and take control of the future of our country.   It is crucial to share the responsibility and to prove our ability for leadership in achieving the Millennium Development Goals. I am calling on the leaders of the world to confront the challenge of transforming our thinking and our actions towards development to build a new Africa that becomes a continent of hope and opportunity.

"110",4497,"MDV",63,2008,"I am delivering this statement on behalf of His Excellency Mr. Abdulla Shahid  Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Maldives  who  unfortunately  had to cancel his trip to New York at the last minute owing to various pressing engagements at home.   39 08-53141   Permit me to begin by expressing my delegation’s warmest congratulations to Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann on his election to preside over the General Assembly at its sixty-third session. I assure him of the full support and cooperation of my delegation in his work. I should also like to take this opportunity to express our profound appreciation to his predecessor  Mr. Srgjan Kerim  for the exemplary manner in which he guided the work of the Assembly at its sixty-second session. In addition  I should like to offer my delegation’s heartfelt gratitude to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his inspiring leadership and dedication in promoting the noble principles and ideals of this Organization.  Four years ago  the people of the Maldives embarked on a comprehensive reform programme aimed at strengthening and modernizing democratic governance in the country. Within that short period of time  unprecedented reforms have been adopted and the political landscape of the country has been completely transformed.  A new Constitution that fully guarantees the civil liberties and fundamental freedoms of our people was adopted on 7 August 2008. To safeguard the foundations of democracy on our islands  several oversight bodies — a National Human Rights Commission that complies with the Paris Principles  a Judicial Service Commission and an independent Elections Commission — have been established and are now operational. Significant progress is also being made in reforming and restructuring the legal and judicial system of the country to align it with internationally accepted norms and standards.  In accordance with the new Constitution  the Maldives will hold its first multiparty presidential election early next week. Parliamentary elections will be held before the end of February and local municipal elections will be completed by July next year.  Those gains were made with the help of the international community  particularly the Commonwealth  the European Union and the United Nations. I thank them for their invaluable support  encouragement and assistance in implementing the reform programme. My Government is also extremely grateful to those organizations for accepting our request for election monitoring and assistance in the electoral process. We are firm in our resolve that the elections shall be held in a free and fair manner in full conformity with internationally recognized standards and best practice.  When the Maldives joined the United Nations in 1965  we were one of the smallest and poorest States Members of this Organization. We lacked even the most basic political  legal and economic infrastructure and institutions necessary for self-governance. Our ability to provide for the welfare of our people was extremely limited. The economy was based largely on subsistence fishery  and the health and education sectors were severely underdeveloped. However  since then  the Maldives has achieved remarkable levels of socio-economic progress. Thirty years of strong and unwavering political leadership  complemented by the hard work of our people and the generous assistance of our development partners  have enabled the country successfully to pursue a people-centred path of sustainable development  based on social equity and justice.  The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) are now fully incorporated into our national development priorities  and I am happy to note that we are among those countries that are on track to achieve most of the MDGs by 2015. We believe that the ongoing political  legal and human rights reform agenda will further strengthen our progress and propel us to new heights of socio-economic development  with the support of our partners.  As a result of our rapid development progress  four years ago the Assembly decided to graduate the Maldives from the list of least developed countries. The Maldives is also being hailed by the international community as a major success story of the multilateral development assistance framework.  And yet those hard-won achievements will be rendered meaningless if MDG 7 — environmental sustainability — cannot be guaranteed. It is now accepted beyond any doubt that climate change poses the most immediate and far-reaching threat to human security  directly compromising the most fundamental rights  including the right to self-determination and the right to life itself  for millions of people around the world.  From the highest Himalayan peaks to the low-lying coastal areas and small islands a metre or so above sea level  global warming and changing weather patterns are undermining the lives and livelihoods of millions of people around the planet  with the poor    08-53141 40  being especially vulnerable. The recent hurricanes that left such a trail of destruction across the Caribbean once again brought into sharp relief the acute vulnerabilities of small island States  such as the Maldives  to global warming and climate change.  For the Maldives  climate change is not a distant possibility. It is happening now and is a reality that we are experiencing on a daily basis. The continuing degradation of the global environment is not only undermining our development process  but also seriously threatening the very survival of our people and the existence of our tiny country.  We are all aware of the grim predictions in the fourth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. If those predictions were to come true  the Maldives and many other small island developing States and low-lying coastal areas would cease to exist within a relatively short period of time.  Hence  the Maldives and many other small island developing States do not have the luxury of hesitation and inaction  nor can we afford to pick and choose where and when that important issue needs to be addressed. For us  it is not solely a development issue  but also a moral  ethical  political  legal and human rights issue  as well as a grave security issue.  That is why the President of the Maldives took the initiative in 1987 to raise that issue before the Assembly. That is also why the Maldives participated in the Security Council debate on the issue last year  and why the Maldives decided to raise the issue before the Human Rights Council in 2008.  The inverse relationship between responsibility for climate change and vulnerability to its consequences is often overlooked. The Maldives and other small island developing States contribute the least to global warming  and yet their development and  indeed  their very existence are fundamentally threatened by global warming and its consequences.  Addressing the injustices of climate change is therefore the moral and ethical responsibility of the entire international community. It is time that we put people back in the climate change debate. We believe that a comprehensive rights-based approach to sustainable and just development  anchored in the concept of common but differentiated responsibility  is now an imperative.  In that regard  we are happy that  at the initiative of the Maldives and 80 other like-minded countries  the United Nations Human Rights Council for the first time  earlier this year  recognized the link between human rights and climate change. The Council will formally debate the issue at its tenth session in March 2009  and we hope that due consideration will be given to the outcome of the debate by our colleagues in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change as they work to ensure an effective and equitable successor to the Kyoto Protocol.  The Maldives is encouraged by the renewed international impetus towards a more sustained and robust approach to achieving the MDGs. Indeed  the high-level event on the MDGs held last week clearly illustrates the collective commitment and interest of the international community to work towards achieving those Goals. The interrelationship between climate change  food security and the attainment of the MDGs cannot be overemphasized. It is now believed that the global food and energy crisis will drive more than 100 million more people into poverty.  While short-term measures may ease the immediate pressures  we believe that a sustainable solution to the problem lies in a fair and equitable trading regime and a shared vision of partnership and cooperation. The early and successful completion of the Doha Development Round and the successful outcome of the post-Bali negotiations  as well as the Follow-up International Conference on Financing for Development to be held in Qatar at the end of this year will prove critical in that regard.  As a country that depends on importing most of its food and all of its energy resources  the Maldives is extremely concerned about the rise in global food and energy prices. Although the situation in the Maldives at present is relatively stable  the potential of a severe blow to our economy is alarmingly high. The Government is fully aware of the risks involved and is taking all necessary precautionary measures to ensure that the crisis does not adversely affect the daily lives and well-being of our people.  Organized crime and terrorism are continuing to threaten the maintenance of international peace and security. The recent bombings in India and Pakistan are yet another tragic reminder of the evil and insidious nature of terrorism. It is therefore important for the international community to ensure that the war against   41 08-53141  terrorism remains a main priority on the international agenda.   The continued scourge of terrorism is particularly alarming when seen in the context of the spread of nuclear arms and other weapons of mass destruction. The threat of a terrorist organization gaining access to such weapons is extremely alarming.  I am happy to note that the Maldives is now party to almost all the international conventions on counter-terrorism. Despite its limited resource and expertise  the Maldives has been actively working towards implementing its various regional and multilateral obligations under the international counter-terrorism regime. I would therefore like to take this opportunity to reiterate our commitment to combating global terrorism and to Security Council resolutions 1373 (2001) and 1540 (2004) in particular.  A permanent and lasting resolution to the question of Palestine remains elusive. The Maldives reiterates its support for the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and to an independent and sovereign homeland. We believe that the two-State solution remains the only viable option and needs to be pursued with greater vigour and vitality.  The United Nations in the twenty-first century must have the ability to take on emerging challenges in an expeditious and efficient manner. While we applaud the present efforts to reform and revitalize the Organization  we believe that such reforms cannot be successfully achieved without the much-anticipated reform of the Security Council. In that regard  we are happy that the Assembly has decided to proceed to intergovernmental negotiations in early 2009. We look forward to participating in those negotiations.  Despite the criticisms levelled against the United Nations  my country remains convinced that the Organization is the most potent and credible universal institution today. For the past six decades  the United Nations has been a beacon of hope for peoples around the world. Its universal character and the multilateralism that it embodies hold true to the ideals and virtues upon which it was founded and  without a doubt  provide the only viable framework for solving the world’s great challenges  including climate change  sustainable development  human rights and global terrorism.  I therefore reaffirm the Maldives’ commitment to the principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter. I offer our full support to the United Nations in its resolute efforts to maintain international peace and security and to work towards the betterment of all humanity. "
"111",4544,"MEX",63,2008,"Allow me first of all to congratulate you  Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann  on your election to the presidency of this Assembly. It is truly an honour for Latin America to have you leading our work.  I have come to the United Nations to reaffirm Mexico’s permanent commitment to strengthen our multilateral system and to build a world order that is more human  more just  more prosperous  cleaner and more secure.  The problems and challenges that are faced today by humankind demand a renewed and strengthened United Nations. Mexico is convinced that the United Nations is at a definitive historical moment. Global challenges of the twenty-first century are testing the leadership and the vitality of the Organization.  Threats to global security are not only the result of conflicts between States  but of the challenges posed by the activities of non-State actors such as international organized crime groups dealing in terrorism and drug trafficking. Those threats also include the degradation of the environment  pandemics  extreme poverty and massive violations of human rights.  I would like to start with a first challenge for our generation and our civilization. Few challenges are as urgent as reversing the effects of climate change. This phenomenon affects indiscriminately rich countries as well as poor  and paradoxically those that have contributed the least to it are often those that are the most vulnerable.  Climate change is not a problem to be faced by nations according to their degree of development. It is a task that requires moving from words to action substantiated in concrete proposals that are based on the principles of common  but differentiated responsibilities.  Mexico has accordingly proposed the establishment  within the United Nations of a Green Fund that will provide incentives for States to redouble their efforts in this area. It is a great satisfaction for us to see that organizations like the World Bank have already taken the initiative to broaden the availability of resources for the benefit of the countries that need them.  And so today  before this Assembly  I reaffirm on behalf of my country the proposal of Mexico to set up such a Green Fund to which each State can all contribute according to its economic capacity and that all of us could use in order to finance programmes to cut emissions  increase energy efficiency or establish measures for adapting to climate change.  I respectfully call upon all nations  especially the most developed  to contribute to the establishment of this Green Fund for the creation of financial instruments to protect the world’s environment.  As the Mexican Nobel Prize winner Octavio Paz said:  “Whatever the form of political and social organization adopted by nations  the most immediate and pressing issue is the survival of the natural environment. To defend nature is to defend humankind.”  We have no time or margin of error to avoid our responsibility with regard to another global challenge that particularly affects the poor: the international rise of food prices. We must act decisively to prevent that situation from annulling the efforts we have made to overcome poverty.  In order to guarantee food security  the Government of Mexico has developed an action plan that aims to facilitate access to the supply of food and includes a sharp reduction of taxes on commodity imports  the enhancement of production  irrigation infrastructure and productivity in the countryside  the establishment of a national strategic reserve of commodities and an increase in direct and conditional financial grants to the 6 million poorest families in the country as compensation for the rise in food prices.  Indeed  many countries not only will be unable to meet the targets set at the 2000 World Summit  but have already experienced setbacks in the fight against poverty because of the phenomenon of high food prices. Despite that unfavourable environment  Mexico is achieving practically all of the Millennium Development Goals. In fact  we have set additional objectives that are reflected in our national development plan. To meet that challenge  Mexico has promoted a significant increase in its social spending     08-51749 24  including in education  health and human development. Next year  we shall allocate $125 billion  or 60 per cent of our budget  to social spending.   Let me cite some examples. A conditional direct transfer programme known as Opportunities  which enables families belonging to the most vulnerable groups of the population to send their children to school or to make regular visits to the doctor  has made it possible to reduce the country’s rate of extreme poverty. Over the past 10 years  the number of persons living in extreme poverty has fallen from 38 million to fewer than 15 million. We have also achieved universal coverage in basic education. In addition  we have set a very clear goal of achieving  by 2011  every country’s ideal in the area of health: universal coverage  including medical care  medicine and treatment  for all Mexican women and men.   We are living in an era of shared responsibility. Everyone knows that  in a globalized world  the consequences of our actions transcend the territories of our countries and affect the entire planet. The security threats faced by Mexico and Latin America are a good example of shared challenges; the illicit trade in drugs  weapons and human persons knows no borders. Today  Latin America is one of the regions with the highest numbers of violent deaths in the world  and that has become one of the major limitations to our development.  In Mexico  we are decisively addressing the delinquency and organized crime that threaten our society and our democratic institutions. Mexican families have decided to live in a Mexico of peace and laws — a Mexico in which neither impunity nor crime is tolerated. That is why we have begun to tackle crime head on. However  that requires shared international responsibility. Mexico reiterates its appeal to all nations to seek new forms of cooperation against those threats. The eradication of those scourges is a guiding principle of Mexico’s national security policy and of the international agenda that we are promoting.  In addition to those problems  there is an increasing questioning of the principles and values defended by the United Nations — principles and values that were once believed to have taken root in the community of States. Some have called into question the fundamental principles of democracy and human rights  citing security requirements or the pre-eminence of economic and social rights. In commemorating the sixtieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  Mexico calls on Member States to defend the universal values that are a precondition for human development and the rule of law.  Migratory flows are another global phenomenon of our time. In today’s world  more than 200 million people live outside their countries of origin. The causes of international migration are complex  ranging from the consolidation of integration processes to the demand for labour  the lack of adequate economic conditions and the persistence of internal or inter-State conflicts. Included in that population are millions of Mexicans living here in the United States  who have sought opportunities for a dignified life for their families.  Migration cannot be reduced to the issue of security  nor can it be managed as merely an economic phenomenon. That is why Mexico believes that the international community must view it in a comprehensive manner that permits migratory flows to be legal  safe  orderly and respectful of human dignity. The United Nations must fully shoulder its responsibility in the light of that global phenomenon  guided by the principle of shared responsibility among the countries of origin  transit and destination.  Terrorism  regardless of its justifications or ideological motivations  has no place in the community of values that we have forged with such great difficulty. Mexico condemns it and reaffirms its readiness to cooperate on the basis of international law to prevent terrorist acts and punish their perpetrators.   The paradox is that all those problems can be dealt with and resolved only through global action  which requires the mediation of the United Nations.  We Mexicans do not wish to shirk our global responsibilities  nor will we do so. We want to be actors in — not observers of — the world’s transformations. We have decided to strengthen our activism. Mexico has the eleventh largest population and the twelfth largest economy in the world  and we have a long tradition of contributing to peace and international law.  Therefore  we want to occupy a place of responsibility and commitment to the common good of nations. That is why Mexico has submitted its candidature for a non-permanent seat on the Security   25 08-51749  Council for the period 2009-2010. If elected  my country will commit itself to acting on the basis of the fundamental values of the international community: the prevention and peaceful settlement of disputes; prohibition of the use or threat of use of force; and compliance with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations  international law and human rights.  We aspire to participate in the Security Council in order to promote Mexico’s democratic ideals  which uphold the rule of law. We would strive to support the Council’s efforts to rebuild societies and institutions torn apart by war and by emerging threats. We would work to ensure the settlement of disputes between States at the earliest possible stage before the International Court of Justice  as well as compliance with its decisions.   Our generation has a historic responsibility to act  here and now  to meet the challenges of humankind in the twenty-first century. It is our conviction that the United Nations is the forum that best represents the diversity of human beings  the plurality of nations and our civilization’s collective aspirations to well-being and progress. It is a privileged alliance formed to ensure a world of peace and justice  security and development  with well-being and opportunities for all.   Multilateralism is the path of the twenty-first century. It is a comprehensive response to globalization. In the new global era  we also need a strengthened and renewed global Organization. We must join forces in order to make it possible for the United Nations to turn into reality the dream of its founders: peace  security and development for all the peoples of the planet."
"112",4569,"MHL",63,2008,"I am honoured and privileged to be able to speak in this great Assembly on behalf of the people of the Republic of the Marshall Islands.  I sincerely congratulate Mr. D’Escoto Brockmann on his election. We have every confidence in his wisdom and able leadership to guide us through our deliberations. I extend my sincere appreciation to the Secretary-General for his leadership and commitment to the work of the United Nations.  As this body enters its sixty-third year  I am moved to express my profound appreciation to those visionaries who foresaw the importance of the United Nations and took it upon themselves to establish the necessary structures for the governance of our collective affairs. It is not that the creation of this body has led to the cessation of war; it has not. Rather  it is that we now have an international forum in which nations can talk over and deliberate issues of mutual concern. One could well imagine what the alternative to talking might be in certain circumstances.    08-51845 12   Like its sister island States in the Pacific region  the Marshall Islands is struggling with the implementation of its Millennium Development Goals. Our effort has been made difficult by unforeseen global forces capable of draining every ounce of our resources. The Marshall Islands is a small economy and inter-island distances are vast  making transportation excessively expensive. Formulating development strategies that address the new conditions has not been easy.  An excellent example in this case may be found in the current energy crisis arising from the escalation in the cost of fossil fuel. Its adverse impact has been immediate and severe. The transportation of essential goods and the movement of people to and from far-flung islands have been sharply curtailed. The distribution of essential services and food products has been acutely impaired  crippling our ability to sustain normal public services and posing a particular threat to food security and medical services. The rising cost of fossil fuels occurring in rapid succession has left the Marshall Islands with no choice but to declare a state of economic emergency.   I am sure  and the International Monetary Fund has observed  that at the height of the crisis  when the cost of a barrel of oil was over $140  numerous other countries were also at the tipping point.  As a small island developing State and a member of the Pacific Islands Forum  we are now exploring the concept of bulk purchasing of petroleum  as endorsed by Pacific Forum leaders in Niue last month. Given our painful experience  we request that the international community give special consideration to the creation of a comprehensive financial facility that can help small island States to cope in times of crisis. In addition  such a facility should also help small island States transition from fossil fuel-based energy to affordable and renewable energy sources.  Our small island States in the Pacific region are among the lowest greenhouse gas emitters in the world  yet we bear the full brunt of climate change and its frightful consequences. The Marshall Islands supports international initiatives aimed at stemming the tide of climate change. In that context  we endorse the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  the European Union-Pacific declaration; Japan’s Cool Earth 50 Programme — which provides funding for adaptation and mitigation — and the Niue Declaration on Climate Change.  In further pursuit of greater guarantees of our territorial integrity  the Pacific island countries intend to introduce at this sixty-third session of the General Assembly a draft resolution calling for climate change to be addressed by the Security Council as nothing less than a security concern of the utmost serious nature.  The litmus test of the international community’s commitment to those agreements should be reflected in its ability to provide sustainable financing for immediate and concrete adaptation programmes on the ground in small island States. It is one thing to produce agreements or resolutions; it is another to give them real meaning in concrete terms. Our commitments must show themselves in deeds  not in words alone.  On the scale that we have experienced over the past few months  the effect of rising fuel costs could bring everything to a standstill. Nevertheless  some in-country adjustments could be made  however painful and agonizing those might be. Insofar as climate change is concerned  however  we have no option. We can alter neither the size nor the height of our islands. They are our natural givens and we are stuck with them. Our own very survival is at stake. If sea levels rise by two metres  Tokelau  Tuvalu  Kiribati and the Marshall Islands will be completely submerged under sea.  Thus  clearly the only alteration or adjustment that is possible is in the mindset and the moral  economic and political behaviour of the heaviest emitters of greenhouse gas. In summary  nothing is more glaring now than the fact that not only are those issues interrelated  but that their cross-cutting global character clearly demands an effective and immediate global response.  If wars have been waged to protect the rights of people to live in freedom and to safeguard their security  why will they not be waged to protect our right to survive the onslaught of climate change? Is the former more morally imperative than the latter? I urge the United Nations to elevate this threat — this nightmare — as justification for total war against climate change.  Recent positive developments  evidenced by the easing of tension and the improvement of relations between the People’s Republic of China and Taiwan   13 08-51845  have begun a new era of good will and hope for improved economic possibilities and political stability. In the context of those emerging dynamics now maturing between China and Taiwan  we see evidence of a mutual desire for dialogue and engagement in a process that can forge better relations and understanding. It is a development worthy of our respect  and it presents an excellent opportunity for the international community to encourage and strengthen that process.  In light of that  the Marshall Islands firmly believes that the time is now ripe for the 23 million people of Taiwan to be accorded full participation in the specialized agencies of the United Nations. This is a starting benchmark that is consistent with the principle of true universality.  As we continue to build a United Nations that better represents our global diversity  the Marshall Islands believes that membership in the Security Council should not be guarded as something that is overly sacred and untouchable. To do so would be to fail to keep in tandem with the principle of change. Council membership should instead be enlarged to reflect reality.   Japan’s fitting aspirations to seek a permanent seat on the Security Council deserve favourable consideration. Japan is a world economic and industrial power  and its leadership and contribution to the United Nations is admirable and self-evident. We are confident that  as a permanent member of the Security Council  Japan will bring much that is good to the Council and to the United Nations as a whole.  Earlier this month  the United Sates marked the seventh anniversary of the tragic loss of lives resulting from barbaric acts carried out against the American people on 11 September 2001. That event threatened our collective security  prompting a response against acts of terrorism.  It is a matter of personal gratification for me to say that  over the past few decades  the special relationship between the Marshalls and the United States has continued to deepen with encouraging outcomes. I am proud to say that  in Afghanistan and Iraq  Marshallese young men and women have been participating actively in coalition forces as part of the United States armed services personnel  demonstrating our commitment to shared democratic ideals.  I take this opportunity to express our deep gratitude to the United States for its continuing constructive role in our partnership under the Compact of Free Association  as well as for its leadership in advancing the cause of freedom around the world.  While the ideal of peace envisioned by the framers of the Charter of the United Nations 63 years ago is yet to be fully achieved  this should not be a cause for despair. People of goodwill everywhere have expressed their yearning for world peace. Today  we see vast increases in movements and organizations devoted to humanitarian work  empowerment of women and mobilization of youth. We see young and older nations engaged in matters of mutual concern. The United Nations has demonstrated our collective capacity for united action in a wide range of social and economic initiatives. It has affirmed our collective will to build a better future.  I believe the time has come for the United Nations to convoke an international convention where the fundamental principles and tenets of permanent world peace can be deliberated. Such a bold step will draw our attention more sharply to our true nature  to existing constructive forces and to the need for unifying social structures that can foster the establishment of a truly new world order  a global society animated by principles of social justice.  Today nothing is more urgent  more imperative and more important for this great institution than the establishment of a world peace that is permanent and that rests firmly on the bedrock of justice. And as we jointly undertake to gradually build that edifice of lasting international peace  let us draw our strength and take comfort in these words from the Gospel of Matthew: “Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God”. "
"113",4593,"MKD",63,2008,"It is a great honour and pleasure for me to have the opportunity to address this distinguished gathering of statesmen from United Nations Member States. Despite past and continuing challenges  this Organization remains an irreplaceable forum where the representatives of many nations can exchange opinions concerning the most pressing issues facing the world we all live in.  Allow me at the outset to welcome the election of Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann of Nicaragua as President of the Assembly at its sixty-third session. I convey to him our unwavering readiness to cooperate during the year of his mandate. At the same time  allow me to congratulate the previous President  my compatriot Srgjan Kerim  on his contribution to the work of the world Organization over the past year  during which numerous issues of global importance   5 08-51845  were considered. Through his engagement  my country  the Republic of Macedonia  has confirmed in the best possible way the values for which we stand and the principles in which we believe when it comes to international relationships  namely  multilateralism as the key tool for cooperation and for the promotion of the fundamental values of peace  democracy and human rights and freedoms.  I take this opportunity also to welcome the efforts of the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  who contributed greatly to the useful and functional operation of the Organization over the past year.  In 2008 we enter the second half of the term envisioned for the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals. The results accomplished thus far are not to be underestimated  but they are still far from satisfactory. Furthermore  even the Goals that have already been achieved are now jeopardized by the new challenges and problems we are facing: the surge in oil and food prices and the adverse effects of climate change.  During this year  a slowdown in economic development has been noted in many countries; that is confirmed by numerous indicators forecasting regional and global recession. It is therefore of the utmost importance to devise new stimuli for the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals. Our debate should thus focus on issues such as development and the implementation of effective concepts for sustainable development  as a crucial part of any agenda for the maintenance of long-term peace  stability and security in the world.  Speaking of issues related to the sustainability of peace and security  we have unfortunately to note that here there are not many reasons for satisfaction. We are still facing numerous crisis situations and old and frozen conflicts  as well as a series of recent turbulent incidents and tensions in several regions of the world. Terrorist acts continue to occur with worrisome frequency  yet Member States remain unable to reach consensus on a truly necessary global counter-terrorism convention. Such recalcitrance has rightly led some people to question the relevance of the United Nations in the present context  as well as the true meaning and scope of multilateralism and the selective implementation of international law and principles.  This year we commemorate the sixtieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  and it is only proper to ask ourselves whether universal respect for its provisions is possible. Human rights problems will certainly not decrease if there continue to be different interpretations of the provisions of the Declaration or if those provisions are only partially implemented. Acceptance of the entire body of human rights is the basis of the rule of law and fundamental to resolving bilateral and international conflicts. Only if those provisions are universally accepted and sincerely supported by all of us will humanity be able to proceed on the path towards progress.  Solutions to problems should be sought within the framework of respect for agreed norms and through equitable dialogue and cooperation. In that context  the United Nations has a specific and valuable role that should not be neglected. It is therefore especially important to develop the Organization further so that it may become more efficient and more relevant in a broader sense  as well as more responsible for the people on whose behalf it acts. I am deeply convinced that our differences are among the greatest values that we possess and that each Member State  regardless of its size  has a valuable contribution to make. It is therefore necessary to overcome our existing differences for the sake of a more efficient United Nations that will serve the world in the twenty-first century in the best possible way.  Over the past few years  South-East Europe and the Balkans have begun moving in the right direction. Although it is certain that not all open problems and issues have been resolved  the tendency of the region towards closer integration with international bodies is clearly discernable. The activities of my country  the Republic of Macedonia  are directed towards continuing participation in and support for regional projects and the consistent promotion of comprehensive regional cooperation with all neighbouring countries. We do not doubt that only together with the rest of the Balkan countries will we be able to contribute to the accelerated integration of the entire region into the European and Euro-Atlantic structures.  At the domestic level  the Republic of Macedonia is continuously working towards the sustainability of its specific model of functional multi-ethnic democracy. We believe that our model has broad and positive regional implications because it has shown that it is possible for different nations and cultures to share the same territory and coexist productively.    08-51845 6   Two strategic goals that have enjoyed our highest priority for years are integration into the European Union and NATO. In recent years  we have invested significant resources and focused all our efforts on the accomplishment of those goals. Unfortunately  at the NATO summit held in April 2008 in Romania  an international precedent was set when the narrow national interests of one country were presented as being more important than the established principles of international law.  Despite the obvious absurdity of the issue  my country is participating actively and constructively in the negotiating process with the Republic of Greece  mediated by the Personal Envoy of the Secretary-General  Ambassador Matthew Nimetz. At the same time  we have consistently respected our legal obligations and affirmed our constructive role by making numerous suggestions and concessions during the long-standing process.  I recall that  at the time of Macedonia’s admittance to the United Nations in 1993  the first major legal precedent was set. A decision was adopted on that occasion to the effect that  instead of using the name which my country had chosen  other Members would address us as “the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia”.  Unfortunately  I am forced to conclude that in that time the other party has not demonstrated the same level of dedication to its agreed obligations  as confirmed by its flagrant breach of the Interim Accord signed by both countries in 1995. According to that document  the Hellenic Republic is legally bound not to object to Macedonia’s application for membership to international  multilateral and regional institutions and organizations in which the Hellenic Republic is already a full member. Contrary to the agreed obligations  at the NATO summit held in April 2008 in Bucharest  Greece objected to the invitation to admittance to NATO extended to the Republic of Macedonia and insisted that  prior to integration  a mutually acceptable solution to the dispute must be reached. The very logic of the negotiations was seriously undermined by that act  while at the same time the principles of the United Nations Charter were derogated. Taking advantage of its status as a standing member  the Hellenic Republic has begun obstructing our integration into the European Union  using similar arguments.  Let me take this opportunity to highlight once again before the Assembly our position  which has been openly expressed on numerous occasions. As a responsible country fully aware of its internationally agreed obligations  the Republic of Macedonia is ready to accept a fair compromise and a reasonable solution that will not deny our national and cultural identity. It is understandable that we are not ready to consent to just any kind of solution in a case of such national importance. If our integration into international institutions is to help stabilize our State  then we should not allow ourselves to be humiliated and internally destabilized by an unsatisfactory compromise.  To conclude  allow me to reiterate the well-known fundamental position in which we  as a State  believe and intend to firmly uphold in the years to come. The principles and values enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations are the highest goals around which we should all unite. Respect for those principles and for the full equality of States and peoples is the sole guarantee for the noble mission of creating a more dignified and just world. "
"114",4637,"MLI",63,2008,"It is my great pleasure  Sir  to convey to you the heartfelt congratulations of the delegation of Mali upon your election to the presidency of the sixty-third session of the General Assembly  and to assure you of our full support. I should like also to hail Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his devotion and commitment to our Organization.  The sixty-third session of the General Assembly is opening with the timely theme of the impact of the global food crisis on poverty and hunger throughout the world. Indeed  it takes place in a difficult international context  one marked by the conjunction of food and energy crises. This situation is of concern to my delegation  as it is a potential source of generalized social and political instability.  What can we do? In Mali  we have granted the highest priority to the fight against poverty and the high cost of living. In this respect  the Government has undertaken a series of measures to stem the effects of the present crisis through  inter alia  a temporary suspension of import duties and taxes on basic foodstuffs  such as rice  wheat flour  oil and milk  as  A/63/PV.13 11 08-53122  well as subsidizing gas  hydrocarbons and agricultural inputs.   My country  Mali  is firmly determined to achieve food self-sufficiency and to become  in the medium term  an agricultural Power. To that end  we have made agriculture the principal tool to attain accelerated growth. Accordingly  an agricultural framework law has been adopted  and its progressive implementation has included the following measures.  First and foremost  the new law contains a measure to launch the rice initiative  which was designed as a proactive and structural response to the dizzying increase in price of grain products on global markets. Next  the law includes the setting up of a national agricultural development fund and a fund for emergencies and disasters. It also involves the setting up of land commissions and a programme to develop low-lying lands within the framework of local irrigation works. Finally  it involves the setting up of a high council for agriculture. In addition  we will soon adopt guidelines for the marketing of grain products  including rice  and a mechanism for supplying agricultural inputs.   Along these same lines  the Government of Mali has prepared and implemented a national strategy to fight poverty  a strategic framework for fighting poverty and a strategic framework for growth and poverty reduction for the period 2007-2011.  In addition  our Social and Economic Development Project has been conceived by the President of the Republic  Mr. Amadou Toumani Touré. It should enable Mali to increase its production and fairly share the fruits of growth  invest in the future and build a State of good governance and the rule of law.  The fight against corruption is another aspect of this overall project. The national convention that will be organized to address this issue in October 2008 should enable the Malian nation to seek through broad consultation a comprehensive understanding of the phenomenon in order to define a plan of action against the scourge.   Seeking to promote transparent and effective management of its public finances  Mali  which has joined the African Union’s African Peer Review Mechanism  has submitted its governance to that evaluation process. This exercise  which will be concluded in January 2009  will take stock of the situation  including in the field of political governance  business governance and governance of socio-economic development. It will result in recommendations for improvements in those areas.  In the same vein  the human rights situation in Mali has been considered within the framework of the new universal periodic review mechanism set up within the context of the Human Rights Council. From this rostrum  laden as it is with symbolism  I would like to reiterate the commitment of the Government of Mali to take concrete action on the relevant recommendations that we are committed to following at the outcome of this process.   Mali remains convinced that the prevention and peaceful settlement of conflicts is the best possible guarantee of international peace and security. Backed by that belief  my country firmly made the choice of dialogue aimed at finding a lasting solution to the situation of insecurity that has prevailed in the north-east of our country. In this respect  the Algiers peace agreement of 4 July 2006 remains relevant  as it preserves our territorial integrity and our national unity  by enabling the various strands of the Malian nation to fully participate in the national construction endeavour.   Aware that security in the Sahelo-Saharan region is closely linked to that of States and peoples sharing the space and that conflicts affecting one country can rapidly spread throughout the region  the Government of Mali  in October 2008  will organize in Bamako a conference on peace  security and development in the Sahelo-Saharan region.   The conference will provide a useful opportunity for the States of the region to jointly reaffirm our commitment to turn our shared space into a zone of peace and security  a centre of stability  growth and development. It will also provide us with responses adapted to the problems and challenges we face: insecurity  transborder banditry  terrorism and trafficking of all types  including trafficking in drugs  arms and human beings.  Here  Mali considers that it is the duty of the international community to take vigorous action to maintain and build international peace and security. In this respect  we welcome and encourage progress A/63/PV.13   08-53122 12  achieved in the resolution of conflicts and crises that rack the African continent  including those in Côte d’Ivoire  the Sudan  Somalia and the Great Lakes region.   Mali calls for the resumption of the negotiating process in the Middle East and reaffirms its unswerving support for the creation of a sovereign and independent Palestinian State.  There are many other serious challenges facing the international community to which we will have to respond appropriately to build a better world together. First and foremost  there is the problem of climate change. Today more than ever before  the very survival of our planet is threatened by climate change  which has a serious impact on living conditions in developing countries such as mine through  inter alia  desertification  the silting up of rivers  the deterioration of the environment  a reduction of the length of the winter periods  floods and poor rainfall patterns. We should  therefore  urgently undertake measures which are commensurate with the pressing nature of the problem. In this respect  the conclusions of the high-level event on climate change in 2007 and those of the Bali Climate Change Conference in the same year are still relevant and are worthy of being implemented in a diligent way. Mali  which is a party to the Kyoto Protocol  is eager to make a useful contribution to the fifteenth United Nations Climate Change Conference  to be held in Copenhagen in December 2009.  The second major challenge to which we must devote particular attention is the HIV/AIDS pandemic  which poses one of the most serious threats to sustainable development. We must redouble our efforts and our resolve to implement the 2001 Declaration of Commitment  as well as the outcomes of the high-level meetings on AIDS and the seventeenth International AIDS Conference  held in Mexico last August. All of these forums have highlighted the severity of the situation and stressed the urgent need to act and to mobilize resources to fight the pandemic.   The third significant challenge for the international community is the situation of landlocked developing countries  which  as a result of their isolation and their great distance from the world’s main markets  are confronted with serious handicaps. I congratulate the Secretary-General for having taken the initiative to convene  following the general debate  a high-level plenary meeting devoted to the midterm review of the Almaty Programme of Action. Mali will actively participate in that meeting and will work to ensure that leads to operational conclusions that can contribute to the comprehensive  rapid  and effective implementation of the Almaty Programme of Action.  The fourth challenge is institutional reform of the United Nations. This issue remains important as the continuation of the establishment of the Peacebuilding Commission and the Human Rights Council and of the strengthening the Economic and Social Council. Thus  the expansion of the Security Council is clearly a pressing necessity  particularly to redress the historic injustice committed against Africa  namely  that it does not have a permanent seat. That is something which is underscored in the joint African position on the issue.  All these challenges which we currently face require a collective global response. Only a reformed and democratized United Nations may serve as a genuine crucible for universal collective conscience capable of best discharging its primary mission  namely  to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war and destruction. Mali will do its full part in this fight. "
"115",4680,"MLT",63,2008,"I would like to join other delegations in congratulating you  Sir  on your unanimous election to preside over the sixty-third session of the General Assembly. I am sure that with your experience and diplomatic skills you will chart a successful outcome of this session.  I also take this opportunity to express my appreciation to Mr. Kerim  President of the Assembly at its sixty-second session  for his leadership and dedication in guiding us diligently throughout his tenure.  Human security and the dignity of every man and woman require us to continue the discussion in order to build consensus on the principle of the responsibility to protect  particularly in relation to genocide  war crimes  ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity  as agreed by the 2005 World Summit. While we realize the sensitivity of the issue  Malta agrees with the Secretary-General that we need to move from declarations of commitment to practice and implementation.  Likewise  the fight against terrorism must remain high on our agenda. We should not lower our guard. We must always be vigilant and ready to take collective and practical action on a daunting  complex and politically sensitive issue. Terrorism has no boundaries  and the unspeakable acts of terrorism can strike anywhere  at any time  in poor and rich countries  with innocent victims paying for these vicious terror attacks  such as that perpetrated in Pakistan last week  attacks which undermine the human rights and fundamental freedoms of the individual and of society itself.  Malta  as a State party to the International Criminal Court  believes that the work carried out so far by the Court is commendable and merits our continued cooperation and commitment towards the maintenance of international peace and security.  Malta feels that the continuing recruitment and use of children in armed conflict and other grave offences against children merit our full condemnation. In this regard  we welcome the sustained activity of the Security Council Working Group on Children and Armed Conflict as well as the sterling work being carried out by the Secretary-General’s Special    08-52265 2  Representative for Children and Armed Conflict  Ms. Coomaraswamy.  The protection of the human being brings with it the responsibility to protect the environment. One of the issues which have been described as the defining challenge of our times  and also a matter described as the flagship issue of the debate at the sixty-second session  is climate change.   Next December we shall commemorate the twentieth anniversary of the Assembly’s adoption  on the proposal of Malta  of resolution 43/53  entitled “Protection of global climate for present and future generations of mankind”  in paragraph 1 of which the Assembly recognized that “climate change is a common concern of mankind”. Malta is proud that the seminal proposal launched in 1988 found universal support  which eventually led to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol.  The fact that the Assembly met earlier this year  after high-level panel discussions  for a thematic debate on “Addressing Climate Change: the United Nations and the World at Work” continues to give credibility and authority to the will of the overwhelming majority of States to respond urgently to climate change.   The process initiated at the Bali Conference last year established a clear road map with a view to agreeing on a new multilateral  comprehensive  coherent and effective post-2012 agreement  which we hope will be reached by 2009  in order to avoid any implementation gap.  Malta reiterates its conviction that we have a common obligation and responsibility to support ambitious and urgent action  at the national  regional and international levels  within the United Nations Framework Convention so as to stop and overturn in these coming years the accumulation of greenhouse gases  which are causing detrimental climate change. The vulnerability of small island States like my country to the negative impacts of climate change needs to be underlined.  For obvious reasons  Malta continues to direct its efforts towards making the Mediterranean a region of peace and cooperation.  We welcome and recognize the important developments on the Cyprus question; the renewed vigour in Israeli-Palestinian negotiations; the indirect negotiations between Israel and Syria  with Turkish mediation; the formation of a national unity Government in Lebanon; and the improved relations between Lebanon and Syria.  Since we met here last year important developments have taken place on the negotiations for a permanent settlement of the Palestinian question. The Annapolis Conference  held in November 2007  renewed hope when there was otherwise a bleak future with regard to the resolution of this question. Malta feels that all United Nations Member States  without exception  should continue to support the Secretary-General in his quest  together with the Quartet  to resolve the issue of Palestine refugees and that of the permanent status of Jerusalem  as well as the other important issues of settlements  borders  water and security.  The Paris International Donors Conference for the Palestinian State  the formal start of Israeli-Palestinian negotiations and the series of meetings between Prime Minister Olmert and President Abbas have given a most welcome meaning to the efforts being made to resolve all outstanding issues  including all core issues without exception.   Malta’s hosting of a United Nations International Meeting on the Question of Palestine  held in June this year  followed shortly afterwards by the visit to Malta of President Mahmoud Abbas in July  came at an important — indeed  crucial — phase in the ongoing efforts to implement the Road Map and its commitments  as well as the obligations for a permanent two-State solution. We shall continue to lend our support to all initiatives that would bring everlasting peace to both the Israeli and Palestinian people.  We welcome all initiatives which create a bond between European and Mediterranean countries. A case in point is the Parliamentary Assembly of the Mediterranean  with its headquarters in Malta  aiming to bring together all the littoral States of the Mediterranean on an equal footing to examine questions and take decisions on issues of direct interest to the countries in the region.  An important development in the Euro-Med partnership was the launching last July  on the initiative of President Sarkozy of France  of what is now known as the Union for the Mediterranean within   3 08-52265  the Barcelona Process. Malta believes that this initiative will be a significant milestone in our common efforts to promote security and prosperity in the Euro-Mediterranean region  to the equal benefit of all European Union member States and Mediterranean partners. Malta looks forward to working constructively with other members of the Union to address some of the problems which the Mediterranean confronts  including in particular development  food security and the provision of water and energy.  While referring to these problems  I must highlight also the unprecedented increase in the influx of irregular immigrants that have been arriving in Malta mainly from the African continent. Malta is well aware of its responsibility in this area. However  as has been highlighted on numerous occasions  it is extremely difficult for us to continue to carry such a burden  which is so acutely disproportionate to the size of the country and its population.   It is for this reason that Malta has continuously requested assistance in tackling this problem through the principles of solidarity and sharing of responsibilities by Europe and other countries  as well as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Malta is grateful to those countries that have come forward to assist us in coping with this phenomenon. Nevertheless  much more needs to be done by us all  including the countries of origin and the countries of transit.  Africa continues to present us with a formidable challenge. It is a challenge not only for African countries themselves  but for the whole of the international community. While noting with satisfaction the success stories in the reduction of poverty  Malta remains very concerned that progress in Africa is still lagging behind. We have an obligation to enhance efforts to assist African countries to meet their legitimate goals of sustainable development.  It has been acknowledged that the Millennium Development Goals and the protection of human rights share a number of characteristics which require our constant attention. Recent phenomena  such as climate change  rising food prices and international financial instability  add further obstacles to the attainment of these Goals. Poverty eradication and the achievement of all the Millennium Development Goals are to be priorities of our times which should be addressed in a multidimensional way  both through the conduct of political and economic decision-making and through social and environmental factors related to different facets  such as culture and gender equality  geography  climate and energy.  Malta strongly believes that the pledges made at the Millennium Summit in 2000 on the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals remain the overarching objective of our global agenda. Besides being a signatory to the Call to Action launched by Prime Minister Gordon Brown  Malta is also actively working to reach its targets for official development assistance set by the European Union.  The United Nations is passing through exciting but challenging times. Under the able leadership of the Secretary-General  the search for a reinvigorated Organization that will provide the whole membership with a sound basis to look to the future with vigour and determination has been endorsed and accepted by Member States.  During the sixty-second session  Member States continued to consider a series of critical issues in the process of reforming our Organization  including advancing a system-wide coherence  reviewing all mandates originating from resolutions of the General Assembly  management practices  the revitalization of the General Assembly  and giving the Security Council a more equitable representation.  We all recognize that the transformation of the United Nations into a stronger Organization requires from all of us determination and conviction that only a concerted effort by all Member States can achieve. The reform of the United Nations is an evolving exercise which requires on our part not only understanding  but also solidarity and partnership which we as Member States must engage to overcome the new and emerging challenges facing humankind.  In a few weeks  Member States will be celebrating the sixtieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Sixty years have passed since that historic day in 1948  six decades which have witnessed great political  economic and social upheavals in the lives of our peoples. Throughout these years  this family of nations has also increased fourfold  an increase bringing with it a diverse community  large and small countries  rich and poor  but with the sole aim of upholding the fundamental premise of the Universal Declaration that    08-52265 4  “all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights”.  This anniversary on 10 December 2008 will provide us with the opportunity to rededicate ourselves to the pledges and commitments we made when we became Members of this Organization. It is a recommitment which as Prime Minister of Malta  and on behalf of the Maltese people  I solemnly make today. "
"116",4726,"MMR",63,2008,"We live in an era when the world is becoming increasingly interdependent. Nothing illustrates this interdependency more than the Asian financial crisis of a decade ago and the current financial crisis gripping the world’s largest economy. The problems may have local roots  but  given the severity of the situation  their effects will transcend borders. The world economy  and by extension the    08-53135 18  stability of nations  depends on the stability of the financial markets.  In recent months  the world has also been challenged by the soaring prices of fuel and food  particularly such staples as rice. Those daunting challenges add an extra burden to developing countries. The answer to those problems lies not in multiplying the number of world summits and conferences but in taking concrete actions towards implementing the commitments made.  My own country has the potential to contribute to energy and food security in our region. We are willing to do our part. We are making concerted efforts to produce more crude oil and natural gas to meet the needs of the domestic market as well as for export. We also have huge potential to produce hydroelectric power. Moreover  as the agriculture sector is the mainstay of Myanmar’s economy  we are focusing on expanding the cultivation of paddy  beans and pulses. We have also introduced new industrial crops  such as jatropha  for use in the production of biofuels.  Developing countries like my own need to have a level playing field in order to promote the economic prosperity and social progress of our people. Subsidies and protectionist policies distort markets and do great harm to developing countries. Political and social progress can be achieved only through development  never through coercive economic measures. Such measures only serve to worsen the plight of the people  particularly the most vulnerable among them  women and children.  Unilateral sanctions have been imposed on my country. Those sanctions are unwarranted. Unilateral sanctions are also against international law. They are not only unfair but immoral. They are counter-productive and deprive countries of their right to development and do not function as a solution to solve the problem.  Myanmar has abundant land and natural resources with which to make a meaningful contribution to the energy and food security of our country and beyond. But in order for us to fulfil our potential we need unfettered access to markets. We need modern technology; we need investment. The sooner the unjust sanctions are revoked and the barriers removed  the sooner the country will be in a position to become the rice bowl of the region and a reliable source of energy.  That brings me to the matter of making the United Nations an Organization better suited to meet the challenges of the twenty-first century. Only a more democratic Organization will be able to respond to the needs of Member States and serve the interests of the international community as a whole. Reform of the Organization  particularly reform of the Security Council  has been on our agenda for some time. However  progress has been extremely slow. The role and authority of the General Assembly as the principal deliberative and representative organ must be enhanced  including in the maintenance of international peace and security.  Reform of the Security Council has eluded us for over a decade. Myanmar believes that the membership of the Security Council should reflect current reality. We believe in an increase in the membership of the Council in both the permanent and the elected categories. Reform should not be confined to an increase in membership but must also include improvement in the Council’s working methods. Above all  it should result in a Security Council that is transparent  credible and democratic.  Here  I would like to stress that attempts to initiate formal or informal discussions in the Security Council on situations that do not constitute a threat to international peace and security are contrary to the letter and the spirit of the Charter. This is a view that Myanmar shares with the Non-Aligned Movement  which constitutes a clear majority of the membership of our Organization.  The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) adopted in 2000 are imperatives that the international community has set for itself. We have now passed the midpoint  but progress has been uneven. Much more remains to be done if the Goals are to be achieved by 2015. While national Governments have the primary responsibility to ensure progress  the international community must help by creating an environment that will enable developing countries to turn faltering steps towards development into firm strides. Fulfilment of official development assistance commitments  increased investment flows  improved market access and resolution of the debt problem are needed to enable the developing countries to achieve the Millennium Development Goals.  For its part  Myanmar is striving to promote better living standards for its people. The implementation of   19 08-53135  the MDGs is inextricably linked to the implementation of our national development plan. The national plan focuses on the promotion of equitable and balanced socio-economic development of both rural and urban areas. In recent years  we have made significant progress in areas such as poverty alleviation  the promotion of health and education.  In the health sector  Myanmar has been implementing a national plan that accords priority to the eradication of major diseases such as HIV/AIDS  malaria and tuberculosis. The high-level multisectoral committee on AIDS has been overseeing HIV/AIDS prevention and care activities in our country since 1989. The activities undertaken by the committee include active surveillance  prevention of mother-to-child transmission and community  institution and home-based care services. These activities are carried out by the Government in close cooperation with international organizations such as the World Health Organization  UNICEF and the World Food Programme  and with national and international non-governmental organizations in order to reach out widely to vulnerable groups.  As a result  Myanmar has not only levelled the rate of HIV/AIDS infection but also reduced it. I would like to emphasize that if we are to achieve a more dynamic and effective global response to HIV/AIDS  adequate resources must be made available. Moreover  allocation of resources for HIV/AIDS  malaria and tuberculosis must be based on need rather than on political considerations.  With regard to education  we envision a system for our people that will generate a learning society capable of meeting the challenges of the information age we live in. Long-term investment in the education sector is being made with the aim of building human resource development. The Government has been expanding the number of basic  primary  post-primary  middle and high schools throughout the country in order to provide access to education for all. We strongly believe education to be a fundamental requirement for the attainment of sustainable development. It is also a prerequisite for the achievement of other MDGs.  I am happy to be able to say that  as a result of our efforts  the literacy rate of those 15 years old and above has risen to 94.8 per cent. Likewise  the rate of enrolment in primary schools has reached 98 per cent.  Myanmar also accords priority to creating job opportunities in rural areas as part of its poverty alleviation strategy. In that regard  development projects to improve economic  educational and health conditions in rural areas are being implemented all over the country.  The Secretary-General’s initiative to convene today’s Ministerial Meeting on Reducing Disaster Risks in a Changing Climate is indeed timely. We in Myanmar can relate to the growing concern of the world regarding climate change and its adverse effects. We felt the full brunt of the devastating consequences of climate change last May  when a powerful cyclone slammed into the Ayeyarwaddy delta. Cyclone Nargis left unprecedented death and destruction in its wake. The pain and sorrow felt by the survivors of the devastating storm continue even today.   There is  however  a silver lining in the dark clouds. The Myanmar nation was united in its response to the emergency. The outpouring of generosity was overwhelming. People from all walks of life  regardless of their own difficulties  donated  in cash and in kind  for the victims. The United Nations  States members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations  donor countries  non-governmental organizations and individuals from around the world also responded generously. We have been able to demonstrate willingness and ability to work in concert with the international community. We have been able to rebuild better and stronger homes  schools and monasteries. The paddy fields destroyed by the storm have been replanted.  I would like to take this opportunity to express our heartfelt appreciation to our friends from far and near who came to our assistance in our time of need.  Myanmar is home to over 100 national races  and national unity is of paramount importance. Accordingly  we have been resolutely pursuing a policy of national reconciliation. Our endeavours have resulted in the return to the legal fold of 17 armed groups. We have effectively put an end to the decades-long insurgency. Peace and stability now prevail in almost all parts of the country.  We have also been implementing a seven-step political road map to democracy. The representatives of former armed groups  together with the representatives of political parties  ethnic nationalities and other representatives  took an active part in the National    08-53135 20  Convention process. The National Convention laid down the fundamental principles to be enshrined in a new constitution. Based on those principles  a new Constitution was drafted and was put to a nationwide referendum last May. The people of Myanmar overwhelmingly approved the draft constitution.  The fifth step of the road map  general elections  will be taken in 2010. Necessary measures are being undertaken for the elections. All citizens  regardless of political affiliation  will have equal rights to form political parties and to conduct election campaigns. The Government will make every effort to ensure that the elections are free and fair. The international community can best assist Myanmar’s democratization process by respecting the will of its people  expressed in the recent referendum.  The daunting challenges of the twenty-first century can be addressed only through international cooperation. We can solve international problems of economic  social  cultural or humanitarian character only by working together. To do this  powerful countries should refrain from practicing hegemonic policies through either political or economic pressure.  In the global village in which we live  mutual respect  understanding and tolerance must be the values that we espouse. Let us work together to give our global village a peaceful and prosperous future. "
"117",4737,"MNE",63,2008,"It is my honour and pleasure to welcome the election of Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session. I wish him great success in carrying out that complex  responsible and challenging task. I would also like to express my sincere gratitude and great respect to Mr. Srgjan Kerim  President at the sixty-second session  for successfully leading the Assembly during his tenure. In addition  I would like to pay tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  and to emphasize our full support for his efforts to strengthen the position of the United Nations as a valuable factor in resolving the issues on the ever-expanding international agenda.  Now  if the Assembly will permit me  I should like to continue in my native language.  (spoke in Montenegrin; interpretation provided by the delegation)  As the youngest United Nations Member  Montenegro has left its mark on the international scene. It gained its statehood centuries ago and democratically restored it in 2006. For us  statehood represents political freedom  but also political responsibility. Both are qualities that we look for and find in the United Nations: in the spirit of its Charter  and in the promotion of mutual respect and equality among nations and peoples.  Multilateralism lies at the core of the international system and inspires strong motivation and commitment. That is why the United Nations provides a reliable framework for maintaining international peace and security  strengthening democracy  protecting human rights and freedoms  respecting international law and fostering the economic and social development of all States.  Today  the world Organization is going through a process of necessary reform prompted by great achievements  but also by some setbacks  and even failures. Montenegro supports a process of pragmatic reform at the United Nations. As a small State  we are particularly interested in strengthening the authority of the General Assembly and other main United Nations bodies.    08-52272 2   The Security Council lies at the heart of the overall reform process and needs to be transformed taking into account equitable regional representation  transparency and improvement in its working methods. Montenegro supports intergovernmental negotiations. We are undoubtedly faced with a very challenging and complex process  but one to which Montenegro will strive to contribute.  Respect for human rights and freedoms  improvement of minority and faith-based rights and the strengthening of good-neighbourly relations will continue to be the foundation of our national stability  as well of regional stability. Our engagement at national  regional and international levels is therefore focused on the rule of law and the fight against corruption and organized crime.  This year we mark the sixtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The Declaration is still vital and applicable. We are fully dedicated to its implementation and determined to uphold its values and principles. In support of that  Montenegro has presented its candidature for membership of the Human Rights Council for the period 2012-2015.  As the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals represents one of the key objectives of United Nations policy  it is only natural that small and developing States  such as Montenegro  should be resolved to make a concerted effort towards those goals. Aware of all the challenges in implementing that agenda  Montenegro shares the Secretary-General’s opinion that yesterday’s high-level event contributed positively to the increased commitment to realize the goals that have been set.  Challenges that we are facing today  including political problems  hotspots  blatant violations of human rights and freedoms  proliferation of weapons of mass destruction  terrorism  environmental degradation and climate change  require an adequate response and decisive action. We believe that no effective or lasting response is possible without joint action by the entire international community.  Countries in transition  such as our own  have relevant experience and are strongly motivated to offer continuous support to the implementation of the Monterrey Consensus  in the light of the forthcoming International Conference on Financing for Development  to be held in Doha. Economic challenges faced by countries in transition affect the dynamics and quality of the way we tackle other issues  thus making the implementation of the Millennium Declaration imperative. Therefore  the development needs and priorities of the African countries  discussed at length during the 22 September high-level meeting  require urgent global solidarity and support.  Montenegro fully supports United Nations efforts to resolve the problems caused by the energy crisis  especially rising food prices worldwide. We also fully support the intention of the Secretary-General and of the United Nations to focus the attention of the international community on vital issues such as food prices and food security  in addition to the issues of climate change and the MDGs. The reason behind this is obvious: everyone is affected and is hence committed to solving those problems.  In the light of that  we agree with the proposed United Nations action in the multilateral framework. We commend the recent adoption of the Rome Declaration on World Food Security  and strongly believe that integrated international action is the best response.  As an ecologically concerned State  Montenegro cherishes an interactive relationship between the environmental aspects of the protection of natural resources  on the one hand  and the production and distribution of organic food on the other hand. Furthermore  Montenegro encourages the creation of an international trade environment that favours small-scale producers and developing countries. Public-private partnerships on specific projects  as one form of cooperation between my Government and United Nations agencies in the field of energy efficiency  are also of special importance for us.  Montenegro has many reasons to be satisfied with the dynamics and results of its ongoing reform processes. Promotion of democracy  equality and tolerance among States and peoples has been and will continue to be our political doctrine. We are motivated by a desire for stability and economic and cultural development  and we demonstrate this in practice in our relationships with neighbours and regional partners. It is also a basis for Montenegro’s progress in European and Euro-Atlantic integration.  Our European Union (EU) and NATO agenda is based on the principles of democracy  a functional market economy  efficient institutions and the rule of   3 08-52272  law. In the process of integration  special emphasis is placed on the dynamics and time frame in which our progress is being achieved — in all areas  including political  legislative  economic and public administration reform.  This year  Montenegro joined the Union for the Mediterranean. We appreciate the support offered by our EU partners and other members of that significant initiative. Montenegro stands ready to make its contribution and to take an active part in the revitalization of the projects within that initiative.  Montenegro is taking a step forward in its security policy  centred on multilateral cooperation  with the aim of creating a legislative framework for the deployment of our police  military and civilian personnel to United Nations peacekeeping missions. Montenegro contributed to similar missions more than 100 years ago  in the nineteenth century  and we are now preparing to implement our commitment again in order to meet the current needs for fostering peace and democracy.  In conclusion  I would like to reiterate the commitment of Montenegro to contribute to the strengthening and promotion of the United Nations in our common effort to identify adequate responses to multifaceted challenges the world faces today.

"118",4783,"MNG",63,2008,"This session of the General Assembly is taking place at a time when the international community is faced with formidable challenges and threats of a much more complex nature. Global problems ranging from poverty  violence  inequality and disparity  terrorism  natural disasters and other acute problems have been further impeded by the current global financial  food and energy crisis. As we live in an increasingly globalized and interdependent world the solutions demand our concerted action.  The main theme of this session  namely  the impact of the global food crisis on poverty and hunger in the world  is most timely. Steep increases in staple food prices lead to a global food crisis. Today millions of vulnerable people in poor countries who were probably making ends meet  face even greater challenges. It is a tragic setback that more than 75 million additional people have been driven into hunger and poverty because of the food crisis. The economic challenges posed by soaring food prices are daunting. They take a toll on inflation rates  breed economic protectionism  and further impede economic development for developing nations. Those countries also had to cope with consequent macroeconomic implications concerning the nexus between food price increases and the overall inflation rate.   The Government of Mongolia  having recognized the urgent need to address the food crisis  took the necessary actions at both policy and practical levels to reduce its severe impact on the vulnerable strata of its population. My Government has designated this year as the year for food supply and safety and aims to achieve three main objectives: promoting food production to reduce the country’s dependence on imported goods;   43 08-51839  raising public awareness about food quality; and ensuring safe food production and processing in the country.   In pursuit of the first objective I launched at the beginning of this year the third national crop rehabilitation drive  or campaign to reclaim virgin lands  to revive domestic agricultural production. As a result of that nationwide campaign Mongolia is expected to ensure self-sufficiency in major staple food products by 2010.   Countries throughout the world find themselves intimately affected by oil price hikes. In our case the situation is aggravated by the fact that the surge in imported petroleum prices tends to be followed by overall price increases. Coal remains the primary energy source used for electricity and heating in many countries. The use of inefficient coal-burning technology causes air pollution  impacting negatively on the population’s health and the environment. Therefore  research  development and deployment of clean coal technology are indeed top energy priorities for coal-producing countries such as Mongolia.   The most effective way to mitigate these factors is to improve energy efficiency and pursue energy diversification. In this regard  Mongolia commends the efforts of Member States and international organizations in research and development and the deployment and transfer of innovative energy technologies such as renewable sources  cleaner and lower carbon technologies and nuclear power. These efforts are crucial as we seek to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels. Ensuring energy security is a challenge that requires a comprehensive solution both nationally and internationally. No country in the world is endowed with or has developed all possible energy sources  so every country has a vested interest in energy cooperation and has something to contribute to it.   Mongolia gives special priority to energy cooperation in our region. An institutional foundation for such cooperation has already been laid with regular sessions of the Senior Officials Committee on Energy Cooperation in North-East Asia. The first session of the Committee  hosted by the Mongolian Government in November 2005  established the Intergovernmental Collaborative Mechanism on Energy Cooperation in North-East Asia.   The Tavan Tolgoi  Mongolia’s huge coal coking project has an important role to play in such subregional cooperation. Such subregional cooperation in the energy sector  combined with ongoing efforts to spur the implementation of the Greater Tumen River Initiative  could be conducive to furthering the prospect for economic integration in North-East Asia  one of the most dynamic and diverse regions of the world.  Since the adoption of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in 2000  we have passed the midpoint in our efforts to implement them. Progress on MDG implementation around the globe reveals a sharply contrasting picture. Some countries find themselves in more advanced stages of achievement  while others are still lagging far behind on all or many important Goals. Thus  there is an urgent need to foster an effective global cooperation aimed at assisting off-track countries in their efforts to reach the relevant targets by 2015. In this regard  my delegation looks forward to tomorrow’s high-level discussion to come up with bold and specific commitments to action.  With rich deposits of coal  copper  gold  molybdenum and uranium  most of them still largely untapped  Mongolia indeed has an unprecedented opportunity to embark upon the path of rapid economic growth and sustainable development — if we are able to overcome the partisan divisions which have in our recent past all too often obstructed our onward movement. It is with this in mind that the two main political parties  in an unprecedented move  set aside their long-standing differences and formed a unity Government only a few days ago  following the fifth democratic general elections  of 29 June.   The result of the elections  concluded to have been free and fair by more than 80 observers from more than 20 countries  gave an undeniable majority to my party  the Mongolian People’s Revolutionary Party (MPRP) with 45 out of the total of 76 seats in parliament. However  in the face of the pressing need to forge a national consensus on major development issues  the MPRP has decided voluntarily to give away its right to unilaterally form its own Government and has concluded an agreement with the Mongolian Democratic Party. Our two parties’ historic decision to work hand in hand is testimony to our commitment to the well-being and prosperity of the people of Mongolia.    08-51839 44   I call it the fourth historic choice of my people over the last 100 years  following the declaration of independence in 1911  the abolition of feudalism in 1921-1924 and the embrace of democracy in 1990. I am most confident that this unity will greatly contribute to pulling our efforts together to collectively succeed in achieving the MDGs by 2015 and our MDG-based comprehensive national development strategy by 2021  thus substantially improving the living standards of our people and upgrading Mongolia to a middle-income country.  In our globalized world  no nation can achieve its goals all on its own. That includes Mongolia. Constructive engagement in world affairs through multilateral cooperation mechanisms  with the United Nations at the centre  and deeper integration into the world economy will thus continue to be the cornerstone of Mongolia’s foreign policy. I understand all too well that the existence of a stable  peaceful and prosperous   world is a condition for the fulfilment of my Government’s — or any other Government’s — promise to its people.   With this in mind  I wish to reaffirm Mongolia’s strong resolve to continue its active engagement in the work of the United Nations and other multilateral organizations and processes  and our commitment to the world Organization as a central coordinating instrument of the common efforts of the family of nations to address the complex challenges of our times.

"119",4824,"MOZ",63,2008,"Mr. President  we would like to join previous speakers in congratulating you upon your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session. We are confident that under your wise and diligent leadership  our deliberations will be successful. We take this opportunity to assure you of our full collaboration and wish you success in the discharge of your important responsibilities.  We wish to express our gratitude to your predecessor  Srgjan Kerim of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia  for the pragmatism and dynamism of his endeavours in conducting the work of the sixty-second session. We also reiterate our appreciation to the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  for his engagement in the quest for peace  justice and solutions to the various challenges faced by humanity.  We have witnessed an increasing number of new and complex challenges. Among them  the food crisis is one of my country’s main concerns owing to its direct  immediate impact on the lives of our peoples. The origin of this crisis may be linked to factors such as climate change and the subsequent irregular rainfall that affects agricultural productivity; desertification of vast areas and droughts around the world; increased demand for cereals; higher oil prices and the consequent impact on the price of transportation and other products such as agricultural raw materials; the impact of trade liberalization and agricultural subsidies in developed countries  which have led to a gradual decline in agricultural production in developing countries; and finally  the distortion of cereal prices across the globe.  Once the causes of the crisis have been identified  it becomes the responsibility of the international community to implement relevant and necessary solutions in a consistent and vigorous manner. Through that process  the crisis can be transformed into an opportunity to boost international partnerships and develop our countries.  In that context it is important to emphasize that international cooperation stimulates the revival of the productivity of farmers in developing countries  thus contributing to a speedy transformation of their current subsistence farming practices into commercial agriculture. Such cooperation includes improved access to improved seeds and to fertilizers and pesticides  investments in infrastructure for market accessibility and water management. Accordingly  we reiterate the need to implement the pertinent recommendations set forth at the Conference of the Least Developed Countries on the rules of the World Trade Organization and the food crisis.  Likewise  we call for support for regional efforts such as the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme in the framework of NEPAD  and the ongoing work by the Southern African Development Community  with a view to finding a collective response to mitigate the impact of the food crisis and to re-establish agriculture as the means to ensure food supply and better conditions and quality of life for the peoples of Southern Africa.    08-51839 6   Mozambique is vulnerable to natural disasters and to the dynamics of the international prices of food and fuel products. Those factors represent a major threat to the implementation of the Government’s socio-economic programmes. Despite the notable progress that we have been registering for our production of cassava and maize  we still import large quantities of other food products. Therefore  any cereal price fluctuation in the world immediately affects the day-to-day lives of our people.  Mozambique is endowed with natural resources which are favourable to mixed farming. However  the shortage of financial resources and the weak banking network in the rural zones  combined with the lack of infrastructure and technology to secure the development of commercial agriculture  have not allowed us to scale up our production to the levels that could meet the food needs of our population. The situation is worsened by poor distribution and marketing systems  making it difficult to distribute and market the products from certain surplus zones to the needy ones. Moreover  the cyclic natural disasters that have struck us have resulted in losses of significant plantation areas  causing the people of those areas to live permanently in need. Those calamities have also caused soil erosion and depletion and as a consequence food insecurity and malnutrition affect our people. Mr. Choquehuanca Céspedes (Bolivia)  Vice-President  took the Chair.  In order to address the food crisis  our Government approved last June  a Food Production Action Plan for the period 2008-2011. The programme was designed as a mechanism to implement the Green Revolution which we launched in 2007 and is goal-oriented. We are aware that implementing the Action Plan together with the Green Revolution will require additional resources  and we are therefore appealing for such additional resources for those programmes. We acknowledge the positive effect of the Green Revolution on the implementation of the MDGs  since no one can think about tomorrow or about education or about gender equality or the empowerment of women if they are hungry.  In February 2008  we launched the Presidential Initiative for women and children. At that time  several meetings were held with health professionals  religious and traditional leaders  women and youth. During those meetings  which are being replicated at the local level  it became clear that health issues permeate the MDGs. Although the advances that we have recorded are significant  they are not sufficient to have an impact on the reduction of avoidable deaths in Mozambique.   Our assessments show that we could  for instance  reduce maternal mortality by more than 50 per cent. We could achieve a decrease of 17 per cent in child mortality. We could significantly facilitate access to antiretroviral treatment and to treatment for tuberculosis and malaria. We could  by 2010 have more than 95 per cent of mothers and children sleeping under insecticide-treated mosquito nets. However  in order to achieve those dreams  we are dependent upon an additional funding of $4 per capita a year for the health sector  from now until 2010. Additionally  we need $10 million more for mosquito nets. The $590 million needed to fill the deficit during the next seven years could help us train and employ around 20 000 additional health workers. That amount would raise the number of doctors by 119 per cent  the number of nurses and of mothers with access to health care would rise by 68 per cent.  Our dream is to prevent more avoidable deaths. As we have indicated  we cannot realize that dream by ourselves. We need the predictable  substantial and long-term support of our partners to meet the needs that I have just identified. We need an efficient health-care system and coordinated support from our international partners  which is a noble way to ensure the achievement of MDG 8  which focuses on developing a global partnership for development.  We therefore wish to take this opportunity to commend and encourage the perseverance of the international solidarity movement in helping Africa  and Mozambique in particular  in the context of women’s and children’s health with a view to fulfilling all the commitments made at the Millennium Summit. In numerous parts of the world  funds have been solicited and initiatives undertaken in support of our programmes. That interaction with our partners has led to the building of the necessary consensus on priorities and strategies to ensure sustainable development.  The world is changing and  along with all those changes  new global challenges have arisen. The United Nations is a universal institution with the legitimacy and the mandate to debate strategies and find solutions to such major challenges. Nevertheless  structural reforms are needed in order to improve the   7 08-51839  Organization’s ability to overcome the current challenges. In that regard  the reform process should be pursued so that the United Nations can achieve greater unity and improve its ability to provide appropriate responses to the challenges ahead  which will require us to strengthen multilateralism and promote partnerships for peace  security and development across the world.  In conclusion  we reiterate the importance of international cooperation to secure the production of sufficient and affordable food for all and to build a viable consensus for United Nations reform."
"120",4870,"MRT",63,2008,"It is with pleasure that I offer Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann my warmest congratulations on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session. We have every confidence in his exceptional skill and future success in consolidating the gains achieved and in enhancing international peace and security in a world system characterized by prosperity  stability and progress. I would also like to pay tribute to the valuable efforts made by his predecessor  Mr. Srgjan Kerim  to strengthen the principles of dialogue and consultation as a means to reach effective solutions to international issues and disputes. I would further like to express our thanks and gratitude to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his continual efforts on important issues relevant to reforming the Organization and to enhancing international peace and security.  The current session of the Assembly is convening at a time when our country  Mauritania  has undergone a change of head of State. I would like to seize this opportunity to explain the reasons for that change.  In August 2005  after two decades of political tyranny  bribery and increasing corruption  the armed forces and security forces intervened to put an end to the grave abuses that threatened the structure and very existence of the Mauritanian State. That move by the Military Council for Justice and Democracy led to a transitional democratic phase  which successfully concluded in April 2007. Mauritanians and international observers alive attested to the fairness and transparency of that phase. The Mauritanian experiment in democracy became an example worthy of emulation. The satisfaction of various national and international observers and the support of civil society added to the success of the experiment. A series of elections were held  with the support of international partners  leading to the ratification by popular referendum of the Constitution in June 2006.    08-53141 42   A Parliament with two chambers was elected in November of the same year; a new president of the Republic was elected in March 2007; and a new law for the organization of the press was enacted in October 2006  establishing a higher authority for the press  radio and television. With respect to good governance  a new general inspectorate of the State was established; transparency initiative was implemented in the field of extracting industries; public officials were compelled to disclose their financial affairs and property; and public transactions are now undertaken in a transparent manner. Lastly  women were accorded a quota of 20 per cent of all candidatures in our Islamic republic. As a result  18 women were elected to the current Parliament.  Those splendid achievements  in addition to the atmosphere of harmony and accord enjoyed by the people of Mauritania  are the result of the work of the military establishment  which pledged to complete the process within the announced time frame and indeed kept its promise. Once the former President assumed office  anything was possible in the new Mauritania  with all its new institutional gains  in terms of consolidating and deepening the achievements of the transitional period of 2005 to 2007. Regrettably  from the outset the former President demonstrated his weakness and inability to lead the country and confront the many challenges it faced.  Conditions in the country continued to seriously deteriorate over the following 15 months in the political  security  economic and social fields. The deteriorating situation posed a real threat to the country’s peace  security and stability. Indeed  it threatened the very existence and foundations of the State.  Thus our country has  over the past three months  undergone an institutional crisis that led to an interruption in the work of parliamentary institutions and paralysed the affairs of the State  the stability of which was threatened by the intransigence of the executive authority  which prevented Parliament from exercising its constitutional powers.  In order to secure the loyalty of some parliamentarians from the majority party who were unhappy with the difficult situation and concerned about the future of the country  the former President resorted to certain illegal measures that would be unacceptable in any democratic system. He used public funds to buy the allegiance of some parliamentarians. In addition  he made some irregular appointments and arbitrarily fired some high-ranking public officials in order to stem the people’s desire for change. Moreover  he continuously threatened to dissolve Parliament in order to prevent the formation of a parliamentary committee to investigate the sources of financing of a private business created by his family.  The President returned to the Chair.  In the field of security and as a result of his laxity and refusal to heed the advice of the security services  a number of terrorist acts took place for the first time in the country’s history  following the release of a number of terrorists who had been in custody until he took office.  Economically and socially  the situation was simply disastrous. While the people suffered in poverty  hunger and disease  the former President — who  in the aftermath of floods that hit the country  had visited only one city inside Mauritania  the city of Tintane — made 25 visits abroad  costing Mauritanian taxpayers huge amounts of money  without achieving any tangible results in the field of cooperation between Mauritania and its development partners.  The former President continuously and intentionally obstructed the work of democratic institutions and thus paralysed the State. Faced with the failure of his manoeuvres  he resorted to firing high-ranking officials in the leadership of the army and the security services at the same time. That almost led to a confrontation between high-ranking officers and created a situation that could have brought the country to the brink of civil war.  In view of the political impasse  the armed forces and security forces  conscious of the serious dangers to the country  intervened to correct the abuses and to strengthen national unity and other gains made in the country  as well as its prospects for development and progress. That change enjoys the support of two thirds of the members of Parliament  approximately 90 per cent of mayors and two thirds of recognized political parties  in addition to civil society organizations  including cultural and professional societies. Support has also been come from unprecedented popular marches.  The High Council of State declared its commitment to protecting democracy and enhancing democratic processes in Mauritania; guaranteeing the   43 08-53141  continued regular functioning of State institutions; allowing officially recognized political parties to carry out their activities; guaranteeing freedom of the press and the media; respecting the obligations  agreements and international treaties concluded in the name of the Mauritanian State; and organizing free and transparent elections at the earliest possible date.  Aware of the importance of and need for integration among countries and peoples of the world  Mauritania reaffirms its adherence to the Arab Maghreb Union as a strategic choice of the people of the region  the League of Arab States  the African Union and the purposes and principles of the United Nations.  In the same spirit  we reiterate our support for efforts to reform the United Nations and  in particular  the Security Council. We believe that the African continent should be given permanent representation on the Security Council; Africa has been the only continent without permanent representation in the Council since the creation of this Organization. We also call for giving the Arab Group representation in the Security Council in view of the fact that it represents more than 11 per cent of the peoples of the world. We support granting permanent seats in the Security Council to Japan and Germany  since both countries play a vital role in the maintenance of international peace and security.  Allow me to pay special tribute to the great efforts made at the sixty-second session of the General Assembly in the field of development  especially with respect to the steep rise in food prices and all other goods  the financing of development projects and the problem of greenhouse gases and their effect on the planet.  The sixty-third session of the General Assembly falls at a very difficult time  when the world is confronting sharp increases in food prices  that negatively affect the economies of developing countries and could even undermine the economic structure of those countries if no urgent measures are taken to address the problem. The food crisis facing the world requires concerted international efforts and strategies to overcome its negative effects.  Today  we are halfway to the deadline for achieving the Millennium Development Goals. However  many developing countries are still far from achieving those Goals. That is why we call on rich countries to keep their promises to finance development in the developing world.  The Arab-Israeli conflict is a source of tension and a threat to international peace and security in a vital and sensitive region of the world. That is why my country supports the efforts to settle the conflict in a manner that guarantees the Palestinian people the restoration of their rights and the establishment of their own State  with Jerusalem as its capital  coexisting in peace and security with the State of Israel.  As regards the question of the Sudan  we totally and categorically reject the most recent developments  in particular the request of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court to issue an arrest warrant for the President of the Sudan. We believe that such a move would jeopardize peace efforts in that brotherly country and increase tensions in that sensitive region of the world.  My country follows the question of the Western Sahara with interest. While we welcome the latest steps taken to return to the negotiating table  we also renew our support for the efforts of the Secretary-General to reach a final settlement acceptable to both parties.  The dissemination of the culture of peace and the spirit and values of tolerance among peoples and civilizations  the restoration of rights and the realization of justice among peoples are  in our view  the best way to maintain peace and security in the world. The fact that certain questions that have gone unresolved for so long  the widening gap between the poor and the rich  the unfair structure of the global economy and the absence of any attempt to spread justice  equality and fairness have all contributed to the creation of conflicts and to the phenomena of extremism and terrorism.  We in Mauritania condemn and reject terrorism in all its forms. We are equally committed to adhering to our tolerant Islamic values  which reject violence and extremism and call for tolerance and brotherhood. We believe that the international family should seriously consider the causes of the phenomenon of terrorism and ways to confront and eradicate it fully from the world.  We affirm the importance accorded by developing countries to development as we look forward with hope to the results of the Doha Follow-up International Conference on Financing for Development scheduled    08-53141 44  from 29 November to 2 December 2008. We also would like to express our concern at the deadlock of the Doha Round of trade negotiations and call on industrialized countries to show more flexibility and stronger political will in that respect.  Development has economic  social and environmental dimensions. Any shortcomings in any one of those dimensions negatively affects the others. That is why we highlight the need to address the phenomenon of climate change. My country is one of the 10 countries that would be the most vulnerable to the effects of greenhouse gas emissions if they should cause a rise in sea levels. We call on industrial countries to limit the emissions that lead to greenhouse effects.  The commitments undertaken by the international community at the time of the establishment of this Organization will not be implemented unless all countries and peoples of the world are able to benefit from global resources and unless development efforts in the developing countries are supported with a view to creating conditions conducive to decent living in freedom and equality. Only then will we have honoured the commitments we have always affirmed. "
"121",4916,"MUS",63,2008,"I stand in for The Honourable Navinchandra Ramgoolam  Prime Minister of the Republic of Mauritius  who is not able to be personally present to address this Assembly at this session. The Prime Minister has asked me  on his   35 08-53141  behalf to make this statement and to convey his kind greetings to President D’Escoto Brockmann; to his predecessor  Mr. Srgjan Kerim; and our Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon.  The problems we face are many and daunting  but we believe that humankind has the ingenuity and resources to overcome adversity through a unified response. The goal of promoting human development and security  in all its manifold aspects  should remain our priority. In that regard  the theme of this session — “The impact of the global food crisis on poverty and hunger and the need to democratize the United Nations” — is both timely and relevant.  We are all affected by the growing global food crisis. As always  the brunt of food insecurity is borne by Africa  Asia and the Caribbean  where riots and strikes have occurred and social unrest threatens political stability. Admittedly  a number of factors underlie the present scarcity of food. Some of those factors are beyond our control. However  there is an urgent need for us to address such issues as outdated agricultural practices  inadequate infrastructure  the inequitable distribution of land ownership and insecurity of tenure. The list is long. The remedies are known. Hopefully  we can bring to bear the political will that is required.  Mauritius is a net food importing country. To reduce our dependence on food imports  the Government is implementing a plan to maximize food production. We are optimizing land use and diversifying the production of food crops  livestock and seafood. To overcome the constraints of land availability and take advantage of economies of scale  we aim  in partnership with neighbouring countries  to produce for our common domestic markets and eventually for exports to the region. Our experiments in that respect with Madagascar and Mozambique are proving to be mutually beneficial and hold great promise for the future.  The right to food is one that is very often overlooked  and yet it is intimately connected to human dignity. It is important that the international community act now to ensure that this fundamental human right is respected. In this era of scientific and technological prowess  when we are unravelling the mysteries of the immensities of the universe and subatomic particles  and when the discoveries of science daily amaze us and change our perceptions of reality  it is unconscionable that countless children should sleep on an empty stomach. One out of every six persons in the world suffers from hunger. That is the greatest moral challenge facing humanity today.  We commend the Secretary-General for the timely establishment of the High-level Task Force on the Global Food Security Crisis. We also welcome the recent proposal by the European Commission to create a special facility amounting to more than $1.5 billion for a rapid response to food crises  in coordination with the United Nations Task Force and international organizations.  Over a period of almost one year  the unprecedented level of the price of oil has dealt a severe blow to the economic growth of many developing countries. Mauritius depends on imported oil for 80 per cent of its energy consumption  which makes it extremely vulnerable on that count. The share of petroleum products in our import bill went up from 12 per cent in 2000 to 18 per cent in 2007. We have recently set up the “Maurice Ile Durable” project to encourage more efficient use of energy and to tap renewable energy sources. (spoke in French)  The Maurice Ile Durable project is bold  but we believe that the current global situation calls for boldness. The prime objective of the project is to strike a balance between our economic  environmental and social needs. Last year  we achieved a 5.4 per cent growth rate increase and this year we forecast a rate of more than 5.7 per cent. However  we realize that growth is not an end in itself.  The Government is pursuing a model of development that takes into account not only economic imperatives  but also the deep-seated aspirations of each Mauritian citizen. At the same time  we cannot allow ourselves to compromise the opportunities for future generations.  The Maurice Ile Durable project seeks to make Mauritius a fully-fledged laboratory. We will use the natural resources with which our island is so liberally endowed — the sea  the sun  the wind and a rich plant biomass. We seek an environmental solution to the problem of global warming and to our dependence on the extremely volatile hydrocarbons market. We have set ourselves the target of reducing our dependence of petroleum-based products by two thirds within    08-53141 36  20 years. This is how we are contributing to international efforts to combat the greenhouse effect. It is the wager for the future of a very vulnerable small island economy  but I want to believe that it is also the objective of a planet threatened with suffocation on the long term. (spoke in English)  While the causes of food insecurity and the energy crisis are multiple and complex  there is little doubt that climate change will exacerbate the situation in the future. Climate change places a particular burden on developing countries  which have done the least to cause the problem. Developing countries are in dire need of assistance to enhance their adaptive capacity and minimize their vulnerability because  on their own  they cannot bear the burden of the costs of mitigation and adaptation.  As an island  Mauritius is especially vulnerable to the effects of climate change  sea-level rise  beach erosion  coral bleaching and extreme weather conditions. They not only affect our local resources and industries such as fisheries and tourism  but also threaten vital infrastructure  settlements and services. The increased frequency and scale of natural disasters exacerbate our inherent vulnerability.  Mauritius is fully engaged in the post-Bali process. The meetings to be held in Poznan in December and in Copenhagen next year will be crucial to determining emission targets. It is vital that we reach a comprehensive agreement on a climate change framework. At the last high-level meeting on climate change  Mauritius made a plea for the creation of a special fund to enable the development and implementation of adaptation measures. Our appeal to international donors to provide the much-needed resources for operating the fund is yet to be answered. However  we welcome the recent declaration by the leaders of the Group of Eight of a long-term emissions reduction target of at least 50 per cent by 2050. We also welcome their undertaking to help support the mitigation plans of major developing countries through technology transfer and capacity-building.  Small island developing States are innocent victims of global warming and the degradation of the environment. Only a few weeks ago  we witnessed the devastation caused by a quick succession of hurricanes in the Caribbean. We therefore call on the international community to assist small island developing States to incorporate adaptation and mitigation plans into their national strategies. Continued access to official development assistance  concessionary financing arrangements  the reduction of debt servicing and improved terms of trade are crucial to building up the economic resilience of small island developing States.  We are particularly concerned about the inadequate level of implementation of the Barbados Plan of Action and the Mauritius Strategy. We reiterate our request to the international community to honour the offers of assistance made during the international conference on small island developing States held in Mauritius in 2005. Furthermore  the arbitrary gross domestic product criteria applied to determine the eligibility for securing concessionary finance disqualify most small island developing States from accessing much-needed funds for important infrastructure development. It is absolutely necessary in that regard that small island developing States be treated as a distinct category.  More than halfway through  the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) track record is mixed. Some developing countries are on target while others  particularly from the African continent  are facing crippling difficulties. Even the gains painstakingly achieved in fighting hunger and poverty are tenuous and could be nullified by the current food and energy crisis. It is vital that donors and development partners honour the pledges made in the Millennium Declaration  the 2002 Monterrey International Conference on Financing for Development and the 2005 World Summit.  Mauritius is on track to meet the MDG targets. Efforts are under way in all key socio-economic sectors to further improve living standards and to achieve the MDGs as early as possible. We are addressing poverty in a comprehensive and coherent manner  convinced that it will have a positive impact on the other development goals. Our experience has demonstrated that the most effective remedy to poverty is inclusive economic growth.  The Government is pursuing a number of programmes announced in its latest budget to eliminate absolute poverty. We have introduced an Eradication of Absolute Poverty Programme  which comprises a number of integrated development projects within identified pockets of poverty. We have also put in place a Human Resource Development  Knowledge and Arts   37 08-53141  Fund to ensure that university studies become affordable to all. We aim to double enrolment in tertiary education by 2015.  In April  Mauritius hosted the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) International Conference on Poverty and Development. I am happy to inform the Assembly that the Conference formulated a regional strategy for poverty eradication in the SADC countries. The SADC secretariat has taken follow-up action on the development of an implementation plan. In line with one of the Conference recommendations  a joint ministerial task force on food security  comprising the ministers of finance  trade and agriculture  met in Lusaka on 13 July 2008 to tackle the food crisis affecting the region.  Africa’s development needs were debated at the highest level on Monday  22 September. Concrete and concerted action on the part of African States and their cooperation partners is called for to help achieve sustained and sustainable development on the continent. Furthermore  we look forward to the forthcoming Follow-up International Conference on Financing for Development in Doha. It will be a unique opportunity to address the various facets of concessionary financing and to find new resources for development.  More important  the Doha Development Agenda should deliver on its promise of development through increased trading opportunities as a means of eradicating poverty. With regard to the World Trade Organization negotiations  we join those who have called for the talks to progress on the basis of what has already been achieved. We remain fully committed to the Doha Development Agenda and will contribute constructively to the negotiations.  We support the effective and quick implementation of the Aid for Trade Initiative  which should take into account the priorities and needs of beneficiary countries. At present  our limited industrial capacity prevents us from taking full advantage of the opportunities offered by globalization. On the regional front  I am pleased to say that we have made major strides in our integration process. The SADC Free Trade Area was launched on 17 August 2008  and we are aiming to fully liberalize trade by 2012.  Since the adoption of the 2001 Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS (resolution S-26/2)  increasing numbers of people have gained access to HIV prevention and treatment in low- and middle-income countries. However  many countries still have a long way to go to meet the goal we set ourselves under MDG 6 of achieving universal access to HIV prevention  treatment  care and support by 2010. The high prevalence of HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa continues to be a cause for alarm.  Engagement at the highest level is vital in the fight against HIV/AIDS. The Mauritius National AIDS Committee  under the chairmanship of The Honourable Prime Minister  oversees the implementation of a multisectoral HIV and AIDS strategic plan. That plan provides for antiretroviral treatment free of charge to all HIV-infected persons  voluntary counselling and testing service and the implementation of a mother-to-child transmission prevention programme. The Government has also increased the amount allocated to the fight against HIV/AIDS by 50 per cent in the current budget.  As we celebrate the sixtieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in December  we must remain unwavering in our resolve to promote and protect human rights. Much remains to be done to ensure that the basic rights of individuals are universally protected. The Mauritian Constitution guarantees that our citizens enjoy fundamental rights in their everyday lives. The National Human Rights Commission  the Human Rights Centre  the Parliamentary Commission for the Democratization of the Economy and the proposed Equal Opportunities Act are important mechanisms for the protection and promotion of human rights in our country.  As an advocate of all human rights and fundamental freedoms  Mauritius severely condemns the decision of Myanmar’s military junta to prolong the house arrest of Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi. My delegation believes that the national reconciliation and full democratization of Myanmar cannot be achieved without the release of Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi and other political detainees and without the participation of the National League for Democracy in the political process.  Situations of conflict and war inevitably give rise to violations of human rights and to atrocities against innocent civilians. Displacement and violent death continue to be the lot of far too many in parts of the Middle East  Africa and Asia. Mauritius has always    08-53141 38  supported the struggle of the Palestinian people and their inalienable right to self-determination. We favour the creation of a Palestinian State coexisting with the State of Israel within secure and recognized borders. It is through dialogue  negotiations and compromise by both sides that lasting peace can come about in the Middle East.  The deteriorating humanitarian situation in Darfur remains a matter of grave concern for my delegation. We urge all parties involved in the conflict  especially the authorities  to exercise restraint in their actions and to move towards a just and lasting solution to the conflict. We welcome the power-sharing accord reached in Zimbabwe. We hope that a Government of national unity will bring peace  stability and reconciliation to the Zimbabwean people  who have suffered for far too long the brutal consequences of the political crisis and economic meltdown.  The grave and pervasive threat of terrorism knows no boundaries; no country is shielded from its pernicious and devastating impact. Mauritius is committed to the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. It is imperative that we conclude a comprehensive convention against terrorism as soon as possible to reinforce the existing legal framework. In June 2008  as part of its contribution to the international efforts to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations  Mauritius joined the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism.  We fully share the view of the President of the General Assembly regarding the democratization of our Organization. The ongoing discussions on the revitalization of the General Assembly  system-wide coherence  mandate review and management reform in the context of the United Nations reform process should be aimed at strengthening multilateralism. We need comprehensive reform of the Security Council so that it is able to meet the needs and respond to the aspirations of the increasingly changing political realities of the world.  We call for expansion of the Security Council in both the permanent and non-permanent membership categories and for improvement in its working methods. Mauritius remains firmly committed to the Ezulwini Consensus  which calls for two seats in the permanent category and five non-permanent seats for Africa. I should like to reaffirm once again the unequivocal support of Mauritius for India to be a permanent member of a reformed Security Council. We also reaffirm our support for a Latin American and Caribbean country to be a permanent member of a reformed Council. Furthermore  we welcome the recent unanimous decision of the General Assembly to start intergovernmental negotiations on Security Council reform in an informal plenary meeting of the General Assembly by the end of February 2009.  The principles and objectives enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations should continue to guide us in our actions. I would like to bring up once again before the Assembly our legitimate sovereignty claim regarding the Chagos Archipelago  including Diego Garcia. The Archipelago was excised from the territory of Mauritius by the United Kingdom prior to our independence  in disregard of General Assembly resolutions 1514 (XV) of 1960 and 2066 (XX) of 1965. We have always favoured a settlement of the issue through constructive bilateral dialogue. In that regard  I wish to inform the Assembly that high-level talks are under way.  The Government is very sensitive to the aspirations of citizens of Mauritius to return to the islands of their birth in the Chagos Archipelago. I wish to recall here that they were forcibly removed from the Archipelago prior to its excision from Mauritius. Likewise  we urge France to pursue dialogue with Mauritius on the issue of Tromelin. It is our firm conviction that such bilateral dialogue will further consolidate our historical and friendly relations with both the United Kingdom and France.  In conclusion  I wish to reiterate that the United Nations remains the most important and credible international multilateral Organization for the maintenance of peace and security and for building a better and safer world. The President of the General Assembly can rest assured of our unwavering support in the work of the United Nations. "
"122",4953,"MWI",63,2008,"I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Mr. D’Escoto Brockmann on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session. I also take this opportunity to congratulate his predecessor  Mr. Srgjan Kerim  for the wise leadership he provided to the General Assembly during the past year.  I wish to start by stressing that the global food crisis is a collective challenge to the United Nations. Throughout the world  more people are now unable to find enough food to feed themselves. There are increased cases of food riots that  in turn  lead to political instability. The food crisis has resulted from the failure of all nations to increase and sustain the production of staple food crops such as wheat  rice  maize  millet  potatoes and lentils  as well as of fish  meat and poultry.  As leaders in the United Nations  we were aware of the signs pointing towards the global food shortage  widespread famine and malnutrition  but we decided to ignore those signs. We the world leaders failed to acknowledge that the food crisis poses a new threat to the stability of the social framework and economic prosperity of all nations  especially small ones.  I submit to the Assembly that the global food crisis is beginning to erode and even negate the gains made in national and global economic growth and trade that were manifested in many developed and developing countries. If those negative trends are not addressed effectively  there will be growing conflict within and among nations as the scramble for food to feed the people intensifies. Several factors have contributed to the global food crisis  but I will mention only a few.  First  during the past two decades food production in many countries has been affected by persistent severe climate changes  such as cyclones  hurricanes  typhoons  floods  drought  rising sea levels and desertification. Those climate changes reduce productivity in agriculture and food security. The high dependence on rain-fed agriculture  especially in developing sub-Saharan countries  has also placed such countries at the mercy of the vagaries of nature. It is a matter of great concern that global responses to those problems have been in the form of world conferences  seminars and workshops on climate change  but that not much has been done by way of concrete global action.  Secondly  agriculture and food production have been given low priority by international development institutions in their allocation of resources and investment funds. That has been compounded by low national budgetary allocations to food production in    08-51839 10  many countries  especially in Africa. The recent diversion of food crops towards the production of biofuels has also reduced the stock of food and created food insecurity in some countries. That is further aggravated by the preference of commercial farmers to grow cash crops rather than food crops  thereby creating deficits in food production.  Thirdly  there is general concern in Africa that multilateral and bilateral institutions continue to oppose subsidies to agriculture and food production  especially in sub-Saharan Africa  South-East Asia and Latin America. That has been the case despite overwhelming evidence that smallholder farmers continue to find enormous difficulties in accessing agricultural inputs  such as fertilizers  improved seeds  insecticides and herbicides. Those institutions also know that farmers are unable to produce enough food to feed themselves without subsidies.  A matter of global concern is that food production in many developing countries has been adversely affected by environmental destruction and the degradation of agricultural lands caused by serious pollution through the deliberate dumping of toxic waste and hazardous materials in rivers  lakes  seas and other water sources  largely by industries from the North. That has deprived many farmers of land to produce more food. The dumping has spoiled coastal lands  destroyed tourism and brought misery to people who can depend on neither agriculture nor on fish in their waters in order to earn a living.  The problems I have enumerated pose a serious challenge to global food security. World leaders in the United Nations can no longer detach themselves from those serious issues. We should be part of the solution.  First  the Government of Malawi sees the attainment of global food security as a collective challenge. It must be premised on the ability to produce sufficient food and to move it from surplus areas anywhere in the world to food deficit areas. In order to alleviate the global food crisis  Malawi proposes that a compact should be reached by which countries that can produce sufficient food surpluses should be empowered to share with others in the world  wherever they may be  through a fair international trading system. That would ensure that all of humankind has enough food.  Secondly  Malawi proposes that the United Nations urge industrialized countries to make significant increases in resource allocation to agriculture  especially food production. Special attention should be given to improving infrastructure  machinery  equipment and capacity-building for farmers  especially smallholder farmers. The private sector in industrialized countries should be persuaded to increase investment in food production  paying special attention to the application of science and technology to agriculture  and in research on climate change and on measures to protect food-producing nations from the vagaries of climate.  Thirdly  Malawi believes that the global food crisis could be mitigated if the United Nations  the World Bank and other multilateral and donor agencies were seriously to consider granting subsidies for agriculture and food production as an integral part of their global development policy and aid packages to developing countries  especially in sub-Saharan Africa. It would also be useful if the international community were to acknowledge Africa’s potential and capacity to contribute significantly to the solution to the global food shortage. To that end  the United Nations should fully support the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa  which is chaired by former Secretary-General Kofi Annan.  More specifically  Malawi appeals to the Group of Eight countries to support us in creating a green belt around our lakes and along our rivers to irrigate land up to 20 kilometres from the shores. The Malawi Government plans to grow a lot of rice  wheat  maize  millet  cassava  potatoes  beans and lentils for local and international markets.  I wish to conclude by stating that Malawi is convinced that  in order to achieve global food security  the United Nations must persuade the rich industrialized countries to share research  science and technology in food production and processing with the poor countries. Furthermore  the industrialized countries should consider funding food research programmes and subsidizing agriculture in developing countries as part of attaining global food security.  The global food crisis is not beyond the capacity of the community of nations to resolve. The global policy to create a hunger-free world must be adopted here in the General Assembly. All nations big and small  rich and poor  must work together to eliminate the global food shortages  famines  hunger and   11 08-51839  malnutrition. Together we can do it. God bless the United Nations. "
"123",4999,"MYS",63,2008,"The Malaysian delegation congratulates you  Mr. President  on your election as the president of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session.  We are in a situation of unprecedented crisis. The skyrocketing prices of fuel and food have caused us distress and widespread hardship. Beyond that  the current financial and climate crises continue to tear the social fabric of Member States. To term it merely an economic crisis is to understate the case. Indeed  the sheer complexity and connectivity between food  fuel and energy  between finance and climate change  make the task of addressing those convergent crises so bedevilling.   It is here at the United Nations that the crises must be faced and resolved. If we fail to address and remedy those calamities  our role and responsibility in this body will be called into question.  Some have called the current situation  particularly the food crisis  a silent tsunami. I beg to differ. It has not been and is not silent. Instead  the rumblings have been heard for some time  most particularly in Africa. In 1974  the international community gathered in Rome to address the global   35 08-53129  food crisis  and in 1996  again in Rome  we dedicated ourselves at the World Food Summit to eliminating hunger and malnutrition and to achieving sustainable food security for all.   We adopted seven commitments towards that end. It was estimated in 1974 that  if action was not taken  there could be 680 million hungry people in the world in 2010. The latest figure shows that  at present  850 million people face hunger on a daily basis. Clearly  we have failed to take heed of the warnings made 34 years ago. Can we now ask what happened to those resolutions that we made?  Liberalization has fundamentally changed the market structure for food and energy sources. Those changes have allowed for greater international speculation. A clear evidence of speculation on the price of food can be found in the dramatic rise in prices. An increase of close to 40 per cent has been recorded within a six-month period  in some cases. In view of the volatility of food prices  Malaysia strongly supports efforts to promote agriculture and food production.  It is generally assumed that rising food prices automatically benefit all farmers equally. That is not the case. Due to the concentrated and vertically integrated nature of the global food trade  a good number of agribusiness companies control all aspects of cultivation and distribution. We are therefore now witnessing smallholders being squeezed out. They are unable to benefit from rising prices. At the same time  ironically  many have to purchase food items that are available in the market at very high prices.  The energy crisis has some of the same causes as the food situation. Underinvestment is one of those causes. Expectations of continued ample supply have been dashed due to speculation and increased demand. The causes of the fuel  food and climate change crises clearly lie in the unfulfilled hopes and broken promises of sustainable development. In Rio almost a decade and a half ago  the human family agreed that we would undertake concerted action to address the sustainable development challenge based  inter alia  on the principle of common but differentiated responsibility.   Yet  we are facing a crisis that could have catastrophic consequences. It would appear that we have not learned the lessons of history or avoided the habit of producing resolution after resolution minus the requisite pursuit and follow-up. Indeed  that is the root cause of our stagnation in many areas of the Organization’s responsibilities.   Therefore  the question is: what needs to be done? Allow me to make six suggestions.   First  the international community  in particular the developed world  should demonstrate greater political commitment. The focus of the countries of the developed world should be on fulfilling their 2008-2012 commitments and  in so doing  setting a standard for the entire world  rather than on trying to pass the burden of action on to the developing world.  Secondly  we must find the right mix in balancing the competing interests of the three pillars of sustainable development  namely  economic growth  social development and environmental protection.   Thirdly  the optimal mix between governmental and private-sector action must be found. Clearly  market forces and the private sector have a role to play in overcoming these convergent crises. However  the role of the Government is critical in terms of providing policy integration as well as balancing the competing interests of the three pillars of sustainable development.   Fourthly  further infrastructure development and the transfer of technology are critical elements in overcoming the present crises.   Fifthly  we must resolve long-standing issues that lie at the heart of world geopolitics today. In particular  we must resolve the problems in the world’s most volatile regions — which  coincidentally  are some of the world’s largest producers and distribution channels of oil. The United Nations must make a forward thrust in meeting the need for peace and security. Energy and food are truly needs of humanity. Therefore  the United Nations must introduce a synergy of human rights into the matter so that oil and food become basic rights of humanity.  And sixthly  long-term solutions must be found in order to stabilize the price of commodities. More particularly  the futures market must be organized and duly regulated so that it becomes a force of stability  not volatility  in prices. That must be coupled with continued research and development related to alternative energy  be it solar  nuclear or derivative fuel.    08-53129 36   Malaysia recognizes certain realities. In the face of vehement protests  we have taken measures to reduce the level of fuel subsidies  which could have been untenable in the long run. We have also undertaken measures to reduce Government spending and to promote greater energy efficiency. Last July  leaders of the Developing 8 Countries  of which Malaysia is now Chair  agreed in Kuala Lumpur to make serious efforts to cooperate in increasing agricultural production and achieving greater food security. We urge the countries of the developed world to play their rightful greater role in addressing those convergent crises  given their greater wealth and capacities.   The present financial crisis being suffered by the United States threatens to engulf the entire world  although the vast majority of us did not enjoy the benefits when times were good. Somehow  the financial mantra of the United States has lost its magic. Casting our minds back to the Asian financial crisis in 1997  we cannot help but compare the scenarios. The troubles of Asian companies then were the result of outside forces  while the present troubles of United States financial companies are entirely of their own doing. It must be asked: why were the actions taken by the Governments of Asia — in particular  that of Malaysia — to save our own companies a decade ago deemed so wrong  while the present bailout of United States financial companies is deemed to be right? To ensure that such a debacle does not recur  let us today resolve to check the excesses of the so-called financial wizards whose alchemy has resulted in so much suffering. Malaysia supports the view that corporate captains should not sap their entities by receiving unbelievably high pay packages.  New threats to peace and security continue to pose additional challenges for the international community. Terrorism  transnational crime and piracy are but a few of the challenges that confront us. Already  the scourge of terrorism and piracy in international waters has taken its toll on many States. Malaysia  Japan and even Russia have become victims to acts of piracy thousands of miles away from their shores.   Just days ago  in August 2008  two Malaysian vessels were hijacked by pirates in the Gulf of Aden. Sixty-five Malaysians and 15 Filipinos on board those vessels are being held hostage in Somalia. In order to secure the release of the hostages and ensure the safe navigation of our vessels in that area  Malaysia has taken steps in accordance with Security Council resolution 1816 (2008) and international law. My delegation stands ready to work closely with other States that share the same predicament. We urge the Security Council to immediately address the problem in an effective manner. My delegation also calls on States  particularly the littoral States in the region  to provide the means necessary to ensure the security of navigation in their waters.  Democracy  human rights and the rule of law are three important pillars of our political life. Those pillars  enshrined in the Malaysian Constitution  have bequeathed to us freedom and liberty  dignity and harmony  peace and security. Malaysia will protect and strengthen those sacrosanct pillars at all costs in order to ensure that all members of our multireligious and multi-ethnic society can continue to live with one another in peace  harmony and unity  while respecting diversity. We believe that good and harmonious relations among our various religious and ethnic groups are our greatest asset. We respect the rule of law  and no one is above the law.  Malaysia is concerned over recent attempts by certain powerful Member States to question the national laws of countries and the administration of justice under those laws. It needs to be restated: we have no right to meddle — in any form or manifestation  or under any pretext or circumstances — in the conduct of the internal affairs of other countries. If we so chose  we could question the legal basis of the Guantánamo detentions without trial  but we have not done so  inasmuch as we do not question societal behaviour in other jurisdictions. While same-sex fornication and marriage are acceptable in California  that does not mean that sodomy — which is a crime in many countries in Asia — is to be impugned or derided.   Let us remind ourselves of the purposes and principles set out in the United Nations Charter  as well as of the relevant provisions of the 2000 Millennium Declaration and the Outcome Document of the 2005 World Summit  which should be defended and upheld.   Democracy in Malaysia remains very vibrant and progressive. Basic rights continue to be guaranteed for each and every Malaysian citizen  and the rule of law via parliament remains central to our existence as a sovereign and independent nation.   37 08-53129   It is here in the General Assembly that the entire world comes together in a true spirit of common resolve and partnership. That presupposes the creation of an international order and a reformed United Nations that reflect not only the current and future realities  but also our resolve in fulfilling each and every resolution that we have adopted here at the Assembly.   Indeed  it would be elementary at this juncture to answer the question: to what extent have we fulfilled and satisfied the numerous resolutions that we have adopted over the decades? Indeed  what happens to the speeches after speeches that leaders have made? Lest we be blamed as a mere resolution-producing body  let us begin to act in concert to deliver the goods that we all should have delivered for the sake of the very humanity that we are charged with safeguarding. Let us plan the work and subsequently work the plan."
"124",5026,"NAM",63,2008,"I congratulate you  Sir  on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session. We support the priorities that you have identified for this session. I wish to express Namibia’s appreciation for your predecessor  Srgjan Kerim  for focusing the agenda of the sixty-second session on matters of crucial importance to Member States. We commend the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  for tirelessly taking up the challenging issues of peace  security and economic development.  The sixty-third session of the General Assembly is taking place at a time when the global economy is dominated by four interrelated crises. I have in mind the financial crisis in the industrialized countries  the global energy crisis  the devastating impact of climate change as well as the food crisis which has adversely affected poor people around the world. Other  no less daunting  challenges are the HIV/AIDS pandemic  underdevelopment and abject poverty  as well as the need to foster peace and security around the world. We must act decisively and collectively at national  regional and global levels to overcome these challenges.  The devastating effects of climate change have become present-day realities in all parts of the world. Namibia has experienced the negative impact of climate change. The floods and droughts during 2007 and 2008 were some of the most devastating in recent    08-51606 34  times. In their wake  they left poor harvests  livestock losses  environmental degradation  damaged infrastructure and destroyed livelihoods  thus putting a severe strain on our plans to invest in new development projects.   Namibia is committed to the Bali road map in order to conclude the negotiations on the post-Kyoto regime by 2009. We call on all parties to honour their commitments under the Kyoto Protocol  including the immediate and full capitalization of the Adaptation Fund. Namibia will play its part in the lead-up to Copenhagen.  We want to contribute to making Copenhagen a success in terms of commitments and substantial mitigations  financial instruments for adaptation efforts in developing countries and mechanisms for sharing and harnessing appropriate technologies.  As a net importer of food and fuel  Namibia has been hit hard by the soaring prices of commodities. There will be catastrophic increases in the incidence of hunger  malnutrition and infant mortality in developing countries unless the trend is reversed. That calls for a decisive national  regional and international response. In our case  the Government of Namibia has exempted some basic foodstuffs from value-added tax in order to mitigate the effects of higher prices on food. Such interventions can provide some relief to households. However  there remain long-term challenges  which demand appropriate policies and substantial new investment to raise agricultural productivity and increase food production around the world.   There is a real risk that the gains made by developing countries in poverty reduction and the attainment of the other Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) over the years will be reversed if we do not act rapidly.  Global efforts to address the food crisis  the impact of climate change and the drive to achieve the MDGs must go hand in hand. In that regard  we support the proposal for the General Assembly to hold thematic debates until 2015 to take stock of success achieved and setbacks encountered in the achievement of the MDGs.  That will give development cooperating partners an opportunity to account for the fulfilment of their commitments. On the other hand  developing countries should also account for their commitments to strengthen democratic institutions  enhance good governance and fight corruption.  There is a need for genuine political will  especially among donor countries  if the MDGs are to be attained. In this context  open  predictable and non-discriminatory trading and financial systems must be developed. We call for the intensification of the implementation of the Global Partnership for Development as agreed upon at Monterrey in 2002.  We also appeal to the Bretton Woods system and other international financial institutions to create special mechanisms to enable middle-income countries to access financial resources for development on concessional terms. That was called for by the Windhoek Declaration on Development Cooperation with Middle-Income Countries.  The scourge of poverty is one of the most serious challenges facing humanity today. I believe that  with the requisite political will  poverty can be overcome. Let us act in unity of purpose to address not only the manifestations of poverty  but also its underlying causes  which make communities vulnerable. Let us harness the technological  financial and other resources necessary to eliminate the dehumanizing effects of poverty on all members of the human family.  Peace and security as well as social justice are paramount to the achievement of the MDGs and to the resolution of conflicts. In that regard  all countries must commit themselves to implement the policies that promote economic growth  social justice  the rule of law  democracy  respect for human rights and the protection of the environment  in order to guarantee durable peace and security. Mr. Beck (Solomon Islands)  Vice-President  took the Chair.  On 15 September 2008  the political leaders of Zimbabwe signed a power-sharing agreement designed to restore political and economic stability to their country. We wish to congratulate the leaders of Zimbabwe on that important milestone and to express the hope that it will put that sister country on the path towards economic recovery. We commend the mediation efforts of the Southern African Development Community  led by President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa  who invested extraordinary skill  time and energy in the process. We urge the international community to support the implementation of the   35 08-51606  agreement by providing economic  financial and humanitarian assistance. We call for the immediate lifting of all sanctions that have been imposed on that country.  My delegation is concerned that the question of Western Sahara remains unresolved. We support the ongoing direct talks between the parties under the auspices of the Secretary-General. We also call for the implementation of the United Nations settlement plan for Western Sahara and of all relevant United Nations resolutions providing for a free and fair referendum in that territory. Namibia is also concerned about the conflict situations in the Darfur region of the Sudan and in Somalia. We urge the respective parties to those conflicts to work to find lasting peace.  The people of Palestine have an inalienable right to self-determination. Namibia is concerned about the lack of progress in the negotiations on the question of Palestine. We call for the immediate implementation of all United Nations resolutions on Palestine and for the establishment of an independent State of Palestine living side by side with Israel.  My delegation reiterates the call that we have made on several occasions in this House for the unconditional lifting of the economic  commercial and financial blockade against Cuba. Not only is the blockade against international law; its extraterritorial nature impedes free trade and economic development. Namibia calls for the implementation of all resolutions of the General Assembly calling for the lifting of the blockade.  If we are to be able to respond effectively to the manifold challenges of our time  we must accelerate the reform of the United Nations. Member States should work with resolve to strengthen our Organization and to ensure that it delivers in terms of its mandate. However  the process will not be complete without reform of the Security Council. We have an obligation to make the Council more representative  democratic and accountable. It is an anomaly  and it is unjust  that Africa does not have permanent representation on the Security Council. Namibia reiterates the African common position on Council reform as articulated in the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration. Intergovernmental negotiations on reform should commence without any further delay.   It is our duty to ensure that the United Nations remains true to its unique universal character and that it becomes a source of hope for a more secure and peaceful world for current and future generations."
"125",5071,"NER",63,2008,"At the outset  Sir  I should like to warmly congratulate you on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session  which undeniably reflects the high esteem that the international community has for your country of Nicaragua  which is a friend of Niger. Your election is also the well-deserved culmination of an exemplary diplomatic and political career. The length and breadth of your experience makes you the right person to carry out the demanding and noble task entrusted to you. Allow me to assure you of my delegation’s commitment to extending to you our constant support during your time in office. Niger is particularly honoured to be working side by side with you as a Vice-President of the Assembly for the sixty-third session.  May I also pay tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Srgjan Kerim  for the exemplary manner in which he led the sixty-second session and  in particular  for having grappled with the burning issues of the day  including the food and energy crises and climate change. With regard to His Excellency Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon  I should like to express our full appreciation for the significant progress on fundamental issues made by the Organization under his guidance.   The subject you have chosen  Mr. President  as the central theme of the general debate during this session is highly relevant. For several months and to varying degrees  all members of the international community have been affected by the overall rise in food prices. That crisis has gripped the attention of every international body. Mr. Olivier de Schutter  Special Rapporteur on the right to food  was far-sighted in sounding an alarm during a press conference held here at the United Nations in which he identified the initial structural causes and called for international action. Aware of the urgency of the situation  the Secretary-General set up the High-Level Task Force on the Global Food Security Crisis in order to provide a comprehensive and unified respond  support Governments and peoples affected and adopt a Comprehensive Framework for Action to meet the challenges.   The Government of Niger would like to congratulate the Secretary-General on his initiatives. We would also like to warmly congratulate his Task Force for their work and for taking into consideration the numerous efforts and views on this issue. The challenge now is to implement the recommendations in order to save entire groups of people in the world’s most vulnerable countries from the tragedy of hunger.  For its part  Niger has taken major specific measures to address the sharp rise in the cost of basic foodstuffs in order to mitigate the effects on the living conditions of the most vulnerable people.  However  in a country facing the recurrent problem of drought and its consequences for agricultural production  the truth is that only lasting solutions will help us to counter the effects of the phenomenon and to progressively eliminate the uncertainty that characterizes Niger’s production system.   The Government of Niger has therefore decided to give priority to the three programmes introduced at the Doha Conference on Consolidating Food Self-sufficiency in Niger  which was held in June 2007. Those programmes are all the more promising given the potential boon to agriculture as a result of the upcoming construction of the Khandaji dam on the Niger River. The Government will develop its  A/63/PV.13 37 08-53122  approach on the basis of that project and those programmes so as to provide credible response to meet the food needs of the people of Niger.  The international financial crisis  which is affecting many countries and is today being exacerbated by the globalization of the world in which we live  requires that we harness our efforts and initiatives to find solutions requiring commitment on the part of us all. While rich countries fear the risk of widespread economic recession  the poorest countries fear food insecurity caused by prices they can no longer afford. Paradoxically  when it comes to the financial crisis and the consequences of climate change  it is the poorest countries that always pay most dearly for the turbulence affecting the globalized world. My delegation therefore supports the proposals made by President Nicolas Sarkozy of France  which were previously espoused by President Lula da Silva of Brazil  calling on the international community to deal urgently with the issue.   We also hold out hope that the upcoming Doha Follow-up International Conference on Financing for Development will produce results that include safety net measures to protect the poorest countries from external shocks that could compound their vulnerabilities.   Although the food  energy and financial crises are front and centre on the international stage  there are also other challenges facing the international community in the areas of peace  security  development and human rights  among others. We must acknowledge the fact that international peace and security has been as sorely tested by conflicts as by other scourges that are equally devastating to the harmonious development of peoples and countries throughout the world. Those scourges include international terrorism  drug trafficking and the illegal trade in small arms.   Niger is especially concerned about the impact of trafficking in drugs and weapons; and especially mines  throughout the Sahelo-Saharan strip. The actions of certain armed groups are the true cause of the unrest prevailing in the northern part of our territory. Their activities are increasingly being brought under control thanks to steps taken by the relevant institutions of our country. We therefore believe that there is a need for increased willingness and cooperation in this area  similar to that demonstrated in connection with the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy that we adopted in 2006. While we acknowledge that some progress has been made  we must also say that further efforts and commitments are needed from the international community in supporting countries in conflict or emerging from it.  It is important that we support the progress made in countries where  happily  peace is becoming more entrenched  including Liberia  Sierra Leone  Burundi  Guinea-Bissau and the Central African Republic  which was recently inscribed on the agenda of the Peacebuilding Commission. We welcome in particular the resumption of the national peace and reconciliation process in Côte d’Ivoire following the invaluable impetus provided by the Ouagadougou Agreement in 2007. In that regard  my country congratulates and encourages all Ivorian politicians on their commitment to peace. We hope that  with the support of their partners  whose invaluable contributions my delegation also commends  the national peace and reconciliation process will culminate in the holding of the upcoming presidential elections.   We also welcome the resumption of the Manhasset cycle of negotiations as a useful and necessary step in the search for a mutually acceptable and lasting solution to the issue of Western Sahara.  With regard to the Great Lakes region  my delegation welcomes the entry into force  on 21 June 2008  on the Pact on Security  Stability and Development in the Great Lakes Region. We believe that this instrument will enable States parties to address the underlying causes of conflict and to address the challenges they face in the areas of security  governance and development. We also believe that the Pact is part and parcel of the new vision for the settlement of conflicts in Africa  perfect examples of which have just been provided by Nigeria and Cameroon with the resolution of the issue of the Bakassi peninsula  and by Gabon and Equatorial Guinea with the agreement on a mediation process in connection with their territorial dispute.  Nevertheless  conflicts persist in Africa and the Middle East that require appropriate involvement by the international community. With regard to the situation in the Sudan  my delegation welcomes the appointment Mr. Djibril Yipènè Bassolé  former Minister for Foreign Affairs of Burkina Faso  as the Joint African Union-United Nations Chief Mediator for A/63/PV.13   08-53122 38  Darfur. We are certain that Mr. Bassolé will provide new momentum and help to improve the situation in that brotherly country by  among other things  facilitating the implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement  signed in January 2006 between the Government of the Sudan and the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement/Army with regard to the Southern Sudan  and by helping to find an acceptable solution for Darfur.  With regard to Somalia  we welcome the agreement signed on 9 June in Djibouti between the Transitional Federal Government and the Alliance for the Re-Liberation of Somalia. We urge the United Nations to do everything possible to support those countries  both by more effectively backing the African Union Mission in Somalia and by deploying an international peacebuilding or peacekeeping force.  The bilateral negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians that have begun in the context of the commitments undertaken at the Annapolis Conference are a genuine source of satisfaction for my delegation. We believe that the parties should take advantage of those negotiations. We therefore encourage them to maintain the momentum of Annapolis  which reflected the willingness of the parties concerned to make progress towards peace. We should also like to welcome the recent initiative of President Nicolas Sarkozy of France in the context of the Euro-Mediterranean Conference. We fervently hope that all those measures will make it possible to reach a speedy agreement that enshrines the vision of the two-State solution of Palestine and Israel living side by side in peace and security within internationally recognized borders and on the basis of the relevant resolutions of the Security Council  the Arab peace initiative and the Quartet’s road map.  We welcome the Doha agreement on Lebanon  which confirmed the virtue of dialogue and cleared the path for speedy presidential elections and the establishment of a Government. The international community should support the Lebanese people who  through that agreement  have demonstrated their political maturity and ongoing desire for national unity.  The various peace processes now underway will not be successful unless confidence-building measures are first put in place. In that regard  there is a crucial need to find solutions to the issues of disarmament  non-proliferation and the eradication of the trade in small arms. That is especially true for the poorest countries  who pay a heavy price in conflicts sustained by the trade in small arms and light weapons. My delegation therefore deplores the failure at the past session of the Disarmament Commission  another in a series due to the lack of consensus on the agenda.  As we have seen  the challenges in the area of international peace and security are numerous and complex. Unfortunately  for some of us they are accentuated by other serious  recurring and even chronic threats. As the 2005 World Summit acknowledged in its Outcome Document  those threats  which also have an effect on development  are closely linked to other areas in which the United Nations is active  namely  peace  security and human rights.   We therefore believe that the year 2008 is critical  given that it is replete with major events that could contribute to development. I am referring to the Doha Round of trade negotiations  which are at a standstill today; the high-level event on the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) midpoint to the target date for their implementation  the Accra High-Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness; and the Review Conference of the Monterrey Consensus on financing for development.   In the quest for global well-being  Africa and countries in special circumstances — especially least developed countries  landlocked developing countries and small island States — deserve focused attention commensurate with their situation. My delegation would like to pay homage to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his personal commitment and unwavering support for initiatives in that regard intended to benefit Africa. Following the G8 Summit at Heiligendamm  the Secretary-General established the Africa Steering Group to monitor the achievement of the MDGs in Africa. With the support of a working group  the Steering Group is responsible for finding ways to coordinate and rationalize efforts associated with technical and financial assistance in order to speed up Africa’s progress. That initiative is very timely for a country like Niger  whose strategy to reduce poverty and speed up development for the period 2009-2012 focuses precisely on the achievement of the MDGs. Moreover  the various efforts of the Government in recent years in the areas of health  education and access to water have already led to a significant improvement in the relevant indicators.  A/63/PV.13 39 08-53122   The recommendations of the Steering Group and the conclusions of the recent high-level meeting on the MDGs  jointly organized by the President of the General Assembly and the Secretary-General  provide a very clear course of action for making progress.   Sustainable development is the main theme of the Economic and Social Council’s 2008 substantive session. The current debate has clearly shown that such development cannot be achieved without appropriate funding  aid effectiveness and good governance.   In conclusion  the delegation of Niger believes that the United Nations is the world’s premier forum. It must serve as a beacon in those times of both hope and uncertainty  and ensure collective security in the world by means of economic  social and cultural cooperation.  That is why we need genuine reform of the United Nations system. My delegation believes that the reform effort will remain incomplete unless there is a significant change in the Security Council  including as regards both equitable representation and its working methods.   In numerous other areas currently under consideration — such as  among others  evaluating the experiences of countries involved in pilot programmes on system-wide coherence and revitalizing the General Assembly  which we must ensure — my country will contribute as much as it can to adapting our common Organization to the challenges we all face in building a world of peace  prosperity and development.  "
"126",5117,"NGA",63,2008,"I congratulate you  Mr. President  on your election to preside over the General Assembly at its sixty-third session. You may remain assured of the full support and cooperation of the Nigerian delegation as you guide our deliberations. May I also express appreciation to your predecessor for the able manner in which he presided over the work of the Assembly’s sixty-second session.  In his address to this Assembly last year (see A/62/PV.7)  the Nigerian President reaffirmed the determination of Nigeria to remain a stable and prosperous nation  anchored on the enduring principles of democracy  good governance  free enterprise  the rule of law and respect for fundamental human rights. In pursuit of those objectives  we have raised the bar on bold political  economic and social reforms aimed at making our economy more investment friendly and our democracy more inclusive. We continue to count on the support and understanding of the international community  especially our development partners  as we accelerate measures to enhance the overall capacity of the Nigerian State.  A strong  safe and prosperous Nigeria means a dependable contributor not only to regional stability and well-being  but to the emergent global ethics so crucial for the survival of humanity. From the very beginning of our nationhood  our foreign policy has been tethered to a responsible and proactive role in the United Nations and its commitments everywhere. Thus  we never hesitated to respond unconditionally to demands for sacrifices whenever and wherever duty called  whether in the Congo  Sierra Leone  Liberia or now in Darfur  and in the next few months  in Somalia. Nigeria is as safe as the rest of the world. That for us is the true meaning of global solidarity and the sense of equal partnership that informed the vision of the founding fathers of this Organization.  It is against that background that we raise before the Assembly the concern and plight of many developing countries  especially in Africa  suffering from the devastating consequences of the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons. Most of the civil wars and insurgencies in those countries have been carried out with such weapons  and because of their lethality and ready deployment  they may be described as Africa’s own experience of weapons of mass destruction.  We remain convinced that the best and most effective strategy to achieve the goal of preventing  combating and eradicating that illicit and deadly trade is through the elaboration of a legally binding global instrument  as well as the political will on the part of all to stem the uncontrolled proliferation of small arms. Therefore  urgent action is needed to criminalize oil bunkering  the sale of oil so acquired and the use of its proceeds to fuel new crisis situations in Africa  especially in the Gulf of Guinea  through the proliferation of small arms and light weapons. The same creativity and political will that was demonstrated in confronting blood diamonds as a source of regional instability must be available at this time in dealing with the blood oil that now threatens the Gulf.  Nigeria has made enormous sacrifices on behalf of peace in Darfur. Over the years we have maintained peacekeeping troops in the region  first  under the ambit of the African Union and now under the African Union-United Nations hybrid peacekeeping force. We call on the international community to take bold and robust steps that would lead to the full deployment and operationalization of that force. In the same vein  we call on the Government of the Sudan to take steps that will facilitate the attainment of this objective.  Midway towards the target year of 2015  it has become evident that the lofty Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) might not be attained by many countries. This much is clear from the outcome of the High-level event on the MDGs that took place in the margins of this session on 25 September 2008. Mindful of the importance of these Goals for our development  Nigeria is determined to do everything to ensure their realization. In this connection  we commend the efforts of the Secretary-General in creating the Millennium Development Goals Africa Steering Group to map out strategies for African countries to achieve the targets.  It is time to urge  with the directness that these challenging times demand  evidence of a more manifest will on the part of the international    08-53141 10  community  especially our development partners  to really assist Africa to join the rest of the global success story. Around this issue  the Nigerian delegation is looking at ten such indicators.  The first is the critical need for a big infrastructure push  especially in energy and transportation  without which nothing else is possible on the continent. Secondly  the food crisis in Africa must be addressed by redressing the trilogy of fertilizer imbalance between Africa and other regions of the world  removing food subsides in the developed economies  and transferring relevant technology for food production and food processing. Thirdly  the Doha Round of trade negotiations must be revived. Fourthly  massive investment in information technology and higher education is needed to spur development of Africa. Fifthly  strategies must be devised with African Governments on how to transform the continent’s current brain drain into brain gain. Sixthly  a global commitment to stem the flow of small arms and light weapons into Africa is needed. Seventh  national Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative projects in Africa must be encouraged and supported. Eighth  there should be Security Council reforms that accord Africa permanent membership in the Council. That would ensure African ownership of its responses  since over 60 per cent of issues addressed by the Council are African. Ninth  attention should be paid to development of clean energy technology and alternative sources of energy to avert the looming disaster of climate change for a continent that is already very vulnerable. Tenth  we need a breakthrough in the malaria vaccine  together with greater sustained support for the fight against the HIV/AIDS pandemic  two major impediments to reaching our potential in Africa.  The recent steep rise in global food prices has presented us with a monumental challenge and the global embarrassment of compounds of misery sharing increasingly crowded space with compounds of affluence in our global village. It is unacceptable that  despite technological advancements and resources unimaginable two decades ago  children still die of hunger and malnutrition. How can one say that the genius that permits us to make living in outer space feasible looks the other way when over 1 billion people in the world are going to bed hungry and more than 6 million children are dying each year of hunger and malnutrition? This problem deserves the full attention of this Assembly. The right to food for all must be pursued with renewed vigour.  Nigeria condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. We reaffirm our support for the counter-terrorism measures of the Security Council and the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. We have also been implementing the four pillars of the Global Strategy through measures that have proven effective in combating terrorism. For us  the fight against terrorism is strongly anchored in the rule of law and respect for human rights. As we combat this scourge  it is important that  fundamental freedoms and human rights are neither compromised nor abused.  The United Nations must not relent in its pursuit of the goal of a world in which all nations and peoples live in freedom and dignity and in which all political  economic  social  cultural and human rights are fully guaranteed. Our active participation in the activities of the Human Rights Council and the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights is evidence of that commitment.  In our subregion  we are concerned  that drug cartels  often based outside the region  are now targeting West Africa as a transit route for the movement of illicit drugs to other regions. The activities of those drug cartels constitute a serious impediment to development in the subregion. The world must pay adequate attention to this growing problem.  Let me reiterate Nigeria’s unwavering support for the United Nations and its objectives and purposes. We are convinced that the Organization remains the most viable platform for consultations  consensus-building and action on the global challenges that we presently face. Mankind has not developed any better substitute.  Nigeria believes in the pacific settlement of disputes and peaceful coexistence with our neighbours. We showed that when  on 14 August 2008  Nigeria  in full compliance with the ruling of the International Court of Justice  lowered its flag for the last time by withdrawing from the Bakassi Peninsula. For that singular act of statesmanship  Nigeria has justifiably received the commendation of the international community. Our action accords with our long-standing tradition as a nation that honours its commitments. We believe that if we all  in concert  stand up for these shared values and purposes  our Organization and our world will be a much better place.   11 08-53141   This can  and should be a General Assembly like no other  for the crises that face us now have few precedents in scope and complexity. What is required is a new posture to move from data to determination  from rhetoric to results and from words to wisdom. Our many noble visions must begin to somehow find more vigorous forms of expression. A world so greatly challenged must also be a world so much more capable of imagination and boldness. The platform for such boldness and such imagination is here  in this venerable institution founded 63 years ago on the pillars of peace  justice and freedom for all.  Let us never forget the timeless words of the internationalist and Nobel Laureate who warned that to deal with the problems that we have created  we need to move unto a higher order of thinking than the one with which we created them. The time to do so is now  for the clock of humanity is ticking very fast. Our existential challenge did not end with the cold war; indeed  it has just started.  "
"127",5162,"NIC",63,2008,"On behalf of the delegation of the Republic of Nicaragua — cradle of Rubén Darío and Augusto C. Sandino  the home of a people firmly committed to their principle  their efforts for a better world and their calling for universal peace — I extend the brotherly greeting of our President  Comandante Daniel Ortega Saavedra  and of all our authorities and citizens.  Listening to the words of the representatives of the States taking part in this sixty-third session of the General Assembly  we find that we have a common vision of the major serious problems affecting all humankind today. In particular  we agree on the urgent need to act as one in facing those problems and solving them successfully  once and for all  for the benefit of those who inhabit planet Earth.  Hunger  poverty  the high cost of oil and food  the tragic consequences of climate change  terrorism  the urgent need to observe human rights worldwide  the trafficking of and trade in persons  drug trafficking and civil insecurity are  among other issues  matters that must lead us to focus our attention and our efforts.  At the same time  they are questions that arise from the nature and functioning of our Organization and that call for in-depth consideration so that we can make this Organization more effective and democratic  with sufficient guarantees  and so that all countries of the world represented here can have our interests taken into account  our voices heard and our will expressed in the most transparent and effective way possible.   For Nicaragua  an international system based on the hegemony of a few over the majority is unthinkable. Such an anachronistic system  unjust in its very essence  is the reason for the deep political  economic and social inequality in the world. It is the reason for the accelerated and advanced arms race led by countries that have set themselves up as world referees in situations affecting us all. It is the reason for wars of aggression that behind the smokescreen of the globalization of democracy and the promotion of certain freedoms  illegally and illegitimately appropriate scarce energy and natural resources and lead to the political subjugation and grief of entire peoples deprived of their freedom  national independence and their right to their own development.  The international security situation has become increasingly volatile in various parts of the world  bringing new threats to international peace and security and to peoples’ desire for peace. We must act intelligently  cautiously and resolutely to ensure that new fratricidal wars do not assail the world. Therefore  we agree with the priority given by the President of our General Assembly to actions aimed at achieving comprehensive and complete disarmament and nuclear control.  As a country that has fought and continues to fight for its independence  sovereignty and self-determination  and as the victim of military and foreign political intervention several times in its history  Nicaragua understood early on that there was no greater value than freedom. Our national heroes  those who fought in our wars for freedom  are taintless witnesses to the determination of the Nicaraguan people to have a free homeland or death.   43 08-52272   The persistence of poverty and inequality in the world today cannot be justified. Hunger and poverty are sapping economic and social progress for future generations. Despite the efforts made in recent years  the gap between the rich and poor has continued to grow  and millions of people now suffer from hunger and live in poverty or in extreme poverty. It is ethically and politically crucial to put an end to that long-standing injustice to so many human beings.  The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) await greater impetus from countries  primarily those with larger economic resources  and from international financial organizations  which are also called upon to contribute to their accomplishment. Those countries and bodies must clearly demonstrate their genuine political will to achieve all the MDGs and that they are not merely paying lip service to them.  It was established in the Monterrey Consensus  adopted at the International Conference on Financing for Development  that the Bretton Woods institutions  the World Trade Organization and the United Nations must recognize the needs and interests of developing countries and make them central to the work of the financing for development programme to be reviewed in Doha this year.  By and large  we can say that most donors are not honouring the pledges they made to increase their aid unconditionally. United Nations calculations on the total official development assistance needed between 2010 and 2015 in order to achieve the MDGs amount to some $130 billion per year. However  global arms expenditures in 2007 alone reached some $1.399 trillion  according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. Today more than ever  the commitment to allocating at least 0.7 per cent of gross national income for official development assistance without condition must be honoured so that developing countries can have these resources available for our national priorities.  Nicaragua reiterates that  in order to consolidate our efforts in the coming years to eradicate poverty  extreme poverty  hunger and unemployment  we must first eradicate the unjust relationships among States. Those injustices can be felt most tangibly in unfair and imbalanced trade relations between the rich and the poor countries.  My country calls for a fair international market and fair  democratic and balanced international trade that will contribute to strengthening the economy of our countries  allow us to achieve the Millennium Development Goals  and end the criminalization of migration by some receiving countries.  We must ensure the maximum possible economic complementarity among all countries of the world. The developing countries are working hard on that issue in the context of South-South cooperation. We note the successes that have been achieved in very little time in some regions  such as the agreements between some Latin American and Caribbean countries.   The Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas has become a comprehensive platform for cooperation for a number of our countries  complementing their economies. The complementarity we have built seeks to create advantages for our raw materials and agricultural products  as well as for our fishing  mineral and energy resources  to mention but a few. We need complementarity  solidarity and the accelerated transformation of purely economic relationships based on a sense of shared responsibility and unity in the face of the major challenges of the present and the future.  Nothing could be further from that spirit than unbridled capitalism  which is speculative and inefficient and has led the world economy into a serious crisis the effects of which  according to some experts  we are only just beginning to feel  as we have seen recently in the United States financial system.  Just a few hours ago  the President of the World Bank  Robert Zoellick  told the world press that the United States financial crisis will have a severe effect on development assistance  primarily that earmarked for the poorest countries. In other words  the crisis in the financial system will have serious repercussions on our peoples. The same solutions being sought to avoid collapse will need to include measures to ensure that our peoples are not affected by a crisis that we have not brought on ourselves but that we may pay for with worsening poverty and a further delay in our development.  We have also seen that multilateralism in international relations is a means to achieve mutually respectful relationships and peaceful coexistence and to implement development policies based on our own realities. In that conviction  we have been actively committed to the principles and objectives of the Non-Aligned Movement. The reconciliation and national unity Government of Nicaragua  presided over by    08-52272 44  President Daniel Ortega Saavedra  is firmly committed to that vision of the world and is working hand in hand with the people to rebuild a country that  after almost two decades of neoliberalism following a decade of unjust war that was firmly condemned by the International Court of Justice  was in a state of political  social and economic collapse.  Our Government seeks to overcome poverty and to transform Nicaragua through a new alternative model of development that is more just and a new power structure that is truly democratic. Citizens will play a leading role in carrying out that task and will directly redefine the path of the country in line with their own interests.  We propose to improve the quality of life of our people by basing our policies on principles to defend the environment and nature and to conserve our natural heritage. We must establish a participatory new world environmental order with clearly set goals that puts an end to the commercial and utilitarian exploitation of our planetary resources that  as has now been proven  are being depleted at an uncontrollable rate. Those efforts must also include the commitment of the countries that are the largest emitters of the greenhouse gases that have resulted in global warming and have already had other negative and irreversible effects on the planet.   We are also focusing on the development of food sovereignty as a means of feeding our people through our own domestic efforts and through unconditional solidarity with brotherly peoples. At the same time  food security will guarantee that every Nicaraguan has reliable access to nutritious food at a fair cost so as to lead a healthy and active life.  We are developing programmes to eradicate hunger and profiteering. We are providing low-cost seeds  stoves and butane tanks for low-income families. We are also supporting small businesses and working for the establishment of a bank to encourage production.  For Nicaragua  the word “solidarity” is not an empty concept  but rather the cement of the society we wish to build. With that in mind  I cannot fail to stress at this general debate the solidarity of my people with the Government and people of Bolivia  who have been subject to unacceptable and ongoing attempts to destabilize the country. The indigenous people of Bolivia  led by President Evo Morales  have taught us all a lesson in democracy by defending the democracy that they have gained after years of humiliating marginalization.  Once again  Nicaragua denounces the cruel blockade maintained against Cuba in violation of international law. That pathological obsession against Cuba seems to justify all actions and ignores that country’s own problems in combating the terrorism that has been brought from this country to that Caribbean island. The five Cuban patriots who have been jailed in Florida for attempting to prevent terrorist acts against the Cuban people should be set free.  Although it may seem untrue  the process of decolonization is not over. Entire peoples are still oppressed and denied their right to independence and to self-determination. We salute and stand side by side with the people of Puerto Rico and the Western Sahara  with the Polisario Front  and with Argentina in opposition to the occupation of the Malvinas Islands. We also firmly reiterate our call for freedom for the Cypriot people and for putting an end to the partition of that great nation.   We support a comprehensive and peaceful solution in the Middle East that will end once and for all the horrors of war and allow the Palestinian and Israeli people to live as brothers and sisters  and in which the Palestinian people can finally enjoy all of their rights and have a State of their own.  We are convinced that  if we are to achieve the noble objectives embraced by our Organization  we need the true political will to devote time and energy to reviewing our own house. That is even more important in a world of constant change and crisis and requires each of us — our peoples and our States — to be active participants in our own future. As has been said before  we must work together to democratize the United Nations. We are pleased to welcome the proposal of the President of the General Assembly to hold a high-level dialogue on the democratization of the Organization  in which we would consider one by one the pressing problems of and between its various bodies. We are prepared to play a constructive role in that necessary and urgent dialogue.  The times our peoples are facing and the responsibilities we have here in this house will be decisive for millions of people  now and for future generations. It is urgent that we find points of   45 08-52272  convergence so that we can work together to meet the challenges of the times and our responsibilities.   The United Nations Charter is a fundamental reference point to guide our action. In respecting the Charter and ensuring that it is respected  we are respecting ourselves. Its principles must prevail over selfish and petty interests. Above all  the future of humankind is at stake.  Nicaragua reaffirms its call for peace and humanism to contribute to a more just  more humane and more united world in which individual destinies  interconnected and inspired by their love of justice and freedom  come together in the universal task of creating a world that is better for all.  As was said yesterday at the high-level event on the Millennium Development Goals  the unjust international order in which we live must change if it is to be credible  legitimate and effective. Fundamental decisions cannot continue to be taken by one  seven or eight stakeholders and without the participation of the vast majority of humankind. Solutions to this situation are well known and well accepted  at least in principle.   Through the millenniums and centuries  our species has developed institutions — and above all    law — in order to govern human relations and to mediate conflicts through peaceful means. More recently  humankind has developed democracy to that end and  in particular  in order to structure power and authority peacefully. Those are the solutions that our species has developed over the millenniums  and it is difficult to imagine another alternative.   The question before us now is whether we have the political will to apply democracy at the international level  beginning by democratizing the United Nations and by strengthening international law within the framework of United Nations institutions. That is the solution. That is what will overcome the chronically postponed solutions to problems and help us to deal efficiently with urgent new problems. It is possible. Why not? We are speaking of human institutions that we ourselves can change. The question is whether or not we have the political will to do so. I propose that we work together at this sixty-third session of the General Assembly to build that political will through increasingly broader progressive consensus. "
"128",5209,"NLD",63,2008,"When the present session of the General Assembly began on Tuesday  the Secretary-General made important remarks about the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the financial crisis. The world is witnessing extraordinary financial turbulence  and all parties must shoulder their responsibility.  At the same time  the current crisis should not distract us from the need to achieve the MDGs. What kind of world do we want to leave to our children and grandchildren? Any parent who considers that question for a moment will answer: a world in which my children are safe and can build decent lives  free from want; a world in which my children can reach their full potential without fear of repression or terror; a world in which my children are free and their rights are protected.  Everything that we do as the United Nations is about deep desires. There is a direct link between this United Nations building and the homes of hundreds of millions of families all over the world.  One man who forcefully reminded us that we are responsible for the opportunities open to future generations was Franklin Delano Roosevelt. In early 1941  in the darkest hour of the Second World War  he gave us his vision of the future: the dawning of a world in which people would enjoy freedom of expression and belief and would be free from fear and want. After the war  those freedoms became our moral compass. They were set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  proclaimed by this very Assembly almost 60 years ago. Human rights remain the cornerstone of Dutch policy.  If we look around us today  we can see that reality falls far short of our ideal. We still live in a world where  each year  more than 9 million children die before they reach the age of five  and every day millions of people live in fear of violence and the abuse of power.  We cannot accept that. Together  the United Nations comprises a working community and our work is not done — not by a long way. Global challenges require global solutions. Global solutions require global action. Every one of us needs to ask ourselves: What am I doing to make freedom a reality for people at home and elsewhere?  What are we doing to bring about freedom from want? In the past 10 years  millions of people have managed to escape from poverty. In Asia and parts of Africa  a great deal of progress has been made  thanks to the efforts of many people. That progress should inspire hope as we continue to work towards the Millennium Development Goals. There is still so much to do. In some countries  the situation is actually getting worse  especially where health is concerned. One child still dies every three seconds  one mother every minute.  All Governments need to realize that good and ethical governance is an essential foundation for development  and realizing that  they must act accordingly. That also applies to the current financial crisis  where urgent action is needed. The financial sector and regulators should quickly implement the recommendations of the Financial Stability Forum: stricter supervision  better risk management  greater transparency and enhanced accountability. That is how to restore confidence in the financial markets and prevent future crises. The International Monetary Fund should play a central role in that process by further   51 08-51851  stepping up its financial sector oversight. Together  we should re-establish the stability and integrity of the financial system.  Governments have a duty to provide food for their people. The international community will support all those who fight against hunger  want and disease  but we must do so as efficiently as possible. We must not waste resources; the need is too great. Above all  we must work together. We must work together with other Governments  certainly  but also with the business community and civil society. Public-private partnership works. I meet more and more entrepreneurs who are committed to the Millennium Development Goals and actively want to help. Let us grasp the hands they extend.  The Netherlands welcomes the initiative of Mr. d’Escoto Brockmann to place food security at the centre of this session of the General Assembly. Rising food prices hit the poor hardest. The position of small farmers is particularly important. If they are able to increase production  not only will their own families benefit  but the local community will too. That is why the Netherlands has earmarked extra funding for the development of agriculture in developing countries.   However  there can be no food without water. Water is the source of all life — 1.8 billion people currently have no proper access to clean drinking water  and their health  their very lives  are in the balance. So the Netherlands has joined with countries that believe that water is a human right  because access to water is an essential part of freedom from want.  What are we doing to ensure that second essential freedom — freedom from fear? Millions of people still live in the middle of conflict and violence. We must not accept that. Over the past 60 years  United Nations peace operations have played an important role in ending conflict. In many areas  the United Nations has ensured that dormant conflicts do not flare up again. So our efforts must continue  undiminished. Yet peace operations alone are not enough. The root cause of a conflict is often a political dispute  and it often requires a political solution.  There is no place in a free society for torture. There is no place for the death penalty. We all strive for a life without fear  yet there are people who face fear every day in order to defend human rights. To recognize those brave people  the Netherlands has introduced the Human Rights Defenders Tulip  a special honour that will be awarded annually on International Human Rights Day.   In our free world  no one is above the law and no one is beneath it. The Netherlands is proud to host the legal capital of the world in the city of The Hague. We will continue to strive for an International Criminal Court that is supported by all Member States. In a safe world  right is stronger than might. Crimes that outrage world opinion must always be punished. The International Criminal Court is there to support us in that task  and we must support the Court — all of us  openly and unconditionally. A wider acceptance of the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice will also strengthen the international legal order.  We also need to speak about freedom of expression and belief. The debate on that issue often leads to misunderstandings  incomprehension and fears that national traditions may be swept aside. We can all be proud of our cultures and traditions  of the things that distinguish us from others. The challenge for every Government is to affirm its people’s cultural and religious values and customs  and at the same time to build bridges with the rest of the world — bridges that enable people  organizations and religions to meet and draw closer. Finding the right balance is not easy  but it is essential.  Governments are there for everyone — for men and women; for people of all backgrounds and all religious convictions; for monks  priests  rabbis and imams; and equally for those who do not believe in a supreme being. Religion offers people comfort and inspiration in their personal lives. A religion is not a system of dogmas that may be imposed on others by force  and it is certainly not a justification for using violence when one feels aggrieved.   Everyone is free to profess his or her faith  to change religion or not to believe. We must all cherish and defend the freedom of religion or belief. The same goes for the freedom of people to express their views  and those freedoms go hand in hand.  We all know that there are countries in the world where those freedoms are violated  and to those countries I say: Respect the right of every person to freedom of religion and freedom of expression. They are universal rights. They are universal freedoms. At the same time  we must remind everyone who enjoys those freedoms of their responsibility — the    08-51851 52  responsibility to show the same respect to others that we claim for ourselves.  We need the United Nations to ensure those four essential freedoms for which we stand  and the United Nations needs us. A strong United Nations is one in which universal values are central — a United Nations with a fair and balanced Human Rights Council  a United Nations that unites and delivers. When we began building the United Nations together  the number of countries worldwide in which people enjoyed a reasonable level of freedom was around 15 per cent of the total. Today  more than 60 per cent of countries can be called free.  In the same period  the number of people suffering from malnutrition has fallen by several hundred million. The number of armed conflicts is also declining  however serious the situation remains in certain troubled regions. Progress is possible  but it does not happen by itself. For the Netherlands  that is an incentive to continue working  heart and soul  for “a world in which human beings shall enjoy freedom of speech and belief and freedom from fear and want”.  In conclusion  let me echo President Roosevelt’s words: “The world order which we seek is the cooperation of free countries  working together in a friendly  civilized society.” "
"129",5254,"NOR",63,2008,"Sixty years ago  in the fall of 1948  the United Nations adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. That international bill of rights contains a forceful reminder that force can and will be checked  and that the prime purpose of our work here is to keep the strong just and the weak secure.   We will celebrate the anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights later this fall  and we shall be guided by its wording in everything we do. The rights and opportunities of individuals  groups and countries are fundamental  and the United Nations is at the top of the system that oversees those superior rules.   When I come here every year  I am struck by the broad span of items that are discussed in the United Nations. We need to ask  are we focusing on the truly essential  most serious issues of our times? This year  we left on the table the unfinished business of the Doha Round of trade negotiations. The break-up of those talks has stalled our efforts to provide billions of people with increased economic opportunity. It is crucial that we restart this process.  We face a global food crisis. The Secretary-General has described the effect of that crisis on hundreds of millions of people who do not know if they will have enough to eat tomorrow.   Climate and energy are among the biggest issues of our time. They must be on the top of our agenda.   These big issues are also all about poverty  inequity and gender. Leadership is called for — leadership here at the United Nations.  I believe we face not only a food crisis  an energy crisis  a climate crisis  a trade-talk crisis  but a larger  decision-making crisis.   We have great institutional capacity. We discuss  we deliberate and we study  but we are too often unable to decide. Often  those countries that want the least are the countries that decide the most. Those that want the least amount of change and progress are able to slow us down and block decisions. Now also the Security Council seems to face difficulties after many good years.  All countries  all Member States share the responsibility for the functioning of the United Nations as a decision-making body that serves us  that is for people  that solves global problems and that allows all people to benefit from the rights with which they were born and which are written in the Declaration on Human Rights.  To become more effective  the United Nations must reform. The Secretary-General addressed this issue with strong conviction on Tuesday (5th meeting).   45 08-51851  We should support him in that process. I am vesting hope in the ongoing deliberation on system-wide coherence. I co-chaired the High-level Panel on System-wide Coherence  and I am heartened that more and more countries seem to be opting in on the “One UN” approach.  Some organizations  funds and programmes are making efficiency gains. They are truly exceptions. Still  Norway is committed to using the United Nations as the arena for our most important international policymaking activities. We allocate 0.98 per cent of our national income to official development aid. We are the seventh largest contributor to the United Nations in absolute terms. That is why we will be keeping a watchful eye on how the funds and programmes manage their resources and our contributions. We and other donor countries will have to require improved accountability  transparency and a results-based management system.  Reaching the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) is our foremost priority. We have assumed a special responsibility regarding MDG 4 on child mortality and MDG 5 on maternal health. We must all dedicate the next seven years to the bottom billion. Several leaders joined me today in presenting a report from the Global Campaign for the Health Millennium Development Goals. We also presented a plan for the next seven years — an exceptional plan that can allow us to save 10 million lives. If we succeed  we will build more sustainable societies  reduce conflict potential and provide a better basis for growth.  We are making progress towards the Millennium Development Goals. Poverty is being reduced. Child mortality is falling. But we have not made any progress at all with regard to maternal health. That is appalling. There can be only one reason for this awful situation  and that is a persistent neglect of women in a world dominated by men. Just think of all the millions of young girls and young women who know  and who fear and dread  that giving life may cause their own death. All this human tragedy is avoidable by simple means  but we have not taken the problem seriously.  Money does not seem to be a problem when the problem is money. Let us look for a moment at what is happening on Wall Street and in financial markets around the world. There  unsound investment threatens the homes and the jobs of the middle class. Something is fundamentally wrong when money seems to be abundant but funds for investment in people seem so short in supply. Market mechanisms will not fund schools in Afghanistan  hospitals in Rwanda  vaccines given in the slums and the ghettos. That kind of investment requires political will and decisions. And we must provide the framework that will direct resources towards those ends.  When Robert Kennedy was running for president 40 years ago  he said in a speech that a country’s health cannot be measured simply by its economic output. That output  he said  “counts special locks for our doors and the jails for those who break them … yet ... does not allow for the health of our children  the quality of their education or the joy of their play”. And still I would add that health  education and the joy of play form the capital that must grow and spread. Then  and only then  will we reach more equal levels of development and opportunity.  I have come here directly from a visit to the great rainforests of the Amazon  in Brazil  a country whose president is committed to lifting his people out of destitution. That has been President Lula’s leitmotif throughout his political life.  Norway is a fortunate and developed country. From that follows a moral responsibility. We pursue wider development goals and seek to generate positive incentives for change and improve climate change policies.   Efforts against deforestation may give us the largest  quickest and cheapest reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. In the years leading up to 2015 Norway will contribute up to $1 billion to reduce deforestation in the Amazon. This contribution makes Norway the first contributor to the Amazon Fund. The size of Norway’s contribution will depend on how successful Brazil will be in reducing deforestation.  In Bali last December  Norway announced a major initiative to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. Deforestation must be included in a new global agreement on climate change. Addressing climate change in a fashion that will stand the test of time and the scrutiny of future generations ultimately boils down to us versus the sand in the hourglass. It is a test of maturity for international cooperation.  Finally  I would like to say a few words about a fellow Nordic country. For the first time since    08-51851 46  becoming a Member State of the United Nations in 1946 — after 62 years — Iceland is a candidate for the Security Council. Iceland’s candidature reflects the long-standing commitment of all the Nordic countries to international peace and the vital work of the United Nations. Iceland enjoys the active support of its partners in the Nordic group: Denmark  Finland  Sweden and Norway. I urge members to take that into account. "
"130",5300,"NPL",63,2008,"At the outset  allow me to congratulate Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann on his election as President of the General Assembly and to assure him of my delegation’s full cooperation in discharging his responsibilities. I also thank the Secretary-General for his comprehensive report on the work of the United Nations (A/63/1) and his positive reference to the situation prevailing in Nepal.  It is  indeed  a historic opportunity for me to address this Assembly as the first Prime Minister of Nepal  the newest republic of the world. As I stand here in front of the global leadership  I think of the long struggle that I and my party waged with single-mindedness for the liberation of the common man from the clutches of the age-old suppression  deprivation  marginalization and outright negligence of the previously existing polity. My fellow countrymen and women  toiling in the mountains and valleys  working day and night in the lowlands and the urban areas and yet unable to ensure even the simple necessities of life for their families  had a hope and expectation that one day they would lead a decent life with equal rights and opportunities and be recognized as respected citizens of the country.    15 08-52272   We are at that significant turning point in the political history of Nepal  and I and my party are proud to be the leading force of that positive historical change. Today  I see a great hope in the glinting eyes of the Dalit boy from the far west  the downtrodden woman from the indigenous nationality in the east  the homeless Tharu girl  the landless Madhesi and other peasants from the hills living under thatched roofs. I intend to lead them with conviction and sincerity in a new journey of sustainable peace and equitable progress in a modern Nepal. I have  therefore  the honour and great privilege of bringing with me to the Assembly the greetings and best wishes of the people and the Government of that new Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal.  Following the Comprehensive Peace Agreement in November 2006  after a decade-long armed struggle  we began our peace process and eventually held elections to the Constituent Assembly in April this year. People overwhelmingly voted for my party and made us the single largest political party in the Assembly with great hope and expectations. At its first meeting  the Constituent Assembly declared Nepal a federal democratic republic  formally ending the 240-year-old monarchy and creating a new opportunity to transform the old feudalistic State into an inclusive and federal new Nepal. That was in keeping with the long-standing aspirations of the Nepalese people. They voted in favour of the change and transformation that my own party had fought for over so many years. After the historic political transformation  our agenda now is to bring about an equally historic socio-economic transformation of the country.   Today  I must report with all humility that our Constituent Assembly is the most inclusive representative body  of which all marginalized  oppressed ethnic communities  indigenous nationalities  Dalits  the disadvantaged and people from the backward regions and communities are members  which will herald a new beginning in the country. That may very well be an example of representativeness to the world in the first decade of the twenty-first century.  The Government is committed to restoring law and order  providing immediate relief to the people affected by the conflict  fighting against the cancerous growth of corruption and starting an economic recovery package  focusing on pro-poor growth  infrastructure development and public-private partnership. The Government will build an effective partnership with the international community in creating an atmosphere for unleashing a new socio-economic transformation  for which the Nepalese people have so long been waiting.  Nepal’s peace process is unique in its characteristics and is based on multiparty democracy  inclusiveness  accommodation  dialogue and the recognition of the people as the ultimate arbiter. It is the outcome of our own creative disposition towards peace  and we feel that it can also serve as a reference model for peace elsewhere.  We appreciate the continued support of the United Nations for the peace process  especially in monitoring the management of arms and personnel through the United Nations Mission in Nepal. The United Nations Mission has undertaken its mandated tasks well. I also take this opportunity to thank our neighbours  friends and donors for their continued support in favour of the peace process and the institutionalization of democracy in Nepal. I am confident they are doing so to unleash Nepal’s development potential  in accordance with the wish of the Nepalese people.  As we proceed in the peace process within the country  new problems in the form of the global food crisis  rising oil prices and imminent danger from climate change stare us in the face. Those challenges also undermine our achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). There will be no success in achieving the MDGs without ensuring that they are achieved in the least developed countries. Solemn pledges were made in the 2000 Millennium Declaration and at the 2002 International Conference on Financing for Development held in Monterrey. Many of those commitments are yet to be fulfilled and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals remains elusive to most of the world’s poor people.  The United Nations agenda today has to tackle those development challenges and many other issues  such as religious extremism  terrorism  the proliferation of nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction; transnational crimes  such as drugs  human trafficking and money-laundering; continuing conflicts within and among States; and gross violations of human rights  genocide  war crimes and crimes against humanity. It is more than obvious that many of those global problems require global solutions. Together  we can rise to the occasion and adopt the vision and    08-52272 16  strategy that the founders of the United Nations charted in the purposes and principles of the Charter of the Organization. Multilateralism  not unilateralism  is the answer to those problems.  Least developed countries like Nepal are faced with a special predicament in their development efforts. We are trapped in a vicious circle of poverty. For many historical reasons  we have low economic growth  low productivity  underdeveloped industries and traditional agriculture. Because of the low level of social indicators and fewer opportunities  conflict and crisis continue to be prevalent in those countries.   Today  the growing gap between rich and poor within countries as well as between nations is a sure sign of a looming disaster. It is also inhuman and unjust that such a high level of inequality is still so common in this age of human achievements  abundance and progress. Equally important is the fact that islands of prosperity in a sea of poverty are not sustainable and certainly not in the enlightened self-interest of even the developed countries themselves  as they breed resentment  fuel conflict and undermine their own progress in the long run. They also go against the fundamental spirit of the United Nations.   Because of the peculiar nature of the least developed countries and their high level of vulnerability  I strongly urge that the issues of least developed countries be looked at by the United Nations separately and addressed with special and focused programmes. They should be ensured dedicated support and cooperation if we want to make our world the just and inclusive place that the United Nations so proudly espouses.  We are not only least developed  but also landlocked. That is a double disadvantage in our efforts to fulfil our development aspirations. In fact  we feel further marginalized by the overwhelming impact of the downside of globalization and the high cost of trade. We want full implementation of the respective global compacts  the Brussels Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries and the Almaty Programme of Action for the landlocked developing countries. In particular  I would like to highlight the need on the part of our developed country partners to fulfil their commitments and pledges in allocating a certain percentage of their gross national product to those countries and in making trade concessions  debt relief and other capacity-building measures available in accordance with those compacts. On our part  I would like to undertake that Nepal will fulfil its pledge to own its development programmes in accordance with its national priorities  including those on poverty reduction and pro-poor governance policies.  We need to protect our people from the growing vulnerabilities of climate change. For example  in my own country  Nepal  melting glaciers and shifting weather patterns are threatening life-support systems  undermining the sustainability of agriculture and unleashing extreme climate-induced disasters  such as frequent floods and landslides. The Himalayan range provides life-supporting water downstream for more than 1 billion people. Mount Everest  as the roof of the world  and the Himalayan range need to be protected and utilized properly to contribute to humankind as a whole.   I therefore strongly appeal to the international community to extend all necessary support and cooperation to protect and promote that pristine environment. We need to create a regime of common but differentiated responsibilities in which the developed countries will mitigate the burden of adaptation for the vulnerable countries  such as the least developed and small islands. The world stands to benefit from addressing climate change if we are able to harness the tremendous potentials of Nepal’s hydropower  which is a renewable and clean source of energy. To that end  Nepal is ready to invite and encourage investment in its hydropower projects.  I am pleased that the United Nations Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in Asia and the Pacific is now operational in Kathmandu 20 years after it was established by this Assembly. I thank all Members  countries of the region  the Secretary-General and the officials of the Secretariat for the smooth relocation of the Centre from New York to Kathmandu. I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate Nepal’s commitment to making the Centre successful through the cooperation of all countries concerned.  Over the years  peacekeeping has evolved as the soul of the United Nations. With that in mind  since 1958 Nepal has regularly placed its peacekeepers at the call of the United Nations. We are celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of Nepal’s continuous participation in United Nations peacekeeping operations. I take this opportunity to reiterate Nepal’s commitment to   17 08-52272  continuing to provide our troops for the cause of peace worldwide. Today  Nepal is the fifth largest contributor of troops and police personnel to United Nations peacekeeping operations. We are glad that they have earned accolades for their professional competence and performance both at home and abroad. We consider that to be our modest contribution to international peace and security.  The enjoyment of universal human rights is absolutely essential to creating an environment of peace  justice  democracy and development. As a democracy  Nepal is fully committed to protecting and promoting the human rights of its people under all circumstances  with constitutional and legal guarantees and implementation of the international human rights instruments to which Nepal is a party. The Government is committed to ending the environment of impunity. The proposed truth and reconciliation commission will seek to arrive at a necessary balance between peace and justice in order to ensure that justice is served and that the centrality of the peace process is preserved. We will continue to strengthen our National Human Rights Commission so that it can take up its statutory responsibility for the protection and promotion of human rights in the country even more effectively. It goes without saying that the environment for the protection and promotion of human rights in Nepal has significantly improved  especially after the signing of the comprehensive peace agreement in November 2006.  As a least developed country that entered the World Trade Organization (WTO) not too long ago  Nepal is concerned at the lack of tangible progress in negotiations on the Doha Development Agenda. We think that the opportunities in world trade through the multilateral trading framework of WTO should not be delayed any further. The least developed countries deserve genuine duty-free and quota-free market access for all their tradable products from all the major countries  together with more favourable rules of origin and support for enhancing their supply-side capacity. Only then will the Doha Round be a development round in the real sense of the word. Without the meaningful integration of the least developed countries into the global regime  I do not know how we can make the global trading regime sustainable  equitable and inclusive. Similarly  the least developed countries need more aid for trade and trade facilitation measures to enhance their trading capacity.  Today  the United Nations needs to reform and democratize itself in order to take on the numerous challenges in international peace and security effectively  and it should reflect the current realities of the world. We should also give the necessary credibility  legitimacy  competence and effectiveness to the world body in solving global problems.   I take this opportunity to reiterate Nepal’s solemn faith and commitment to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. On behalf of the people and the Government of Nepal  I pledge to work with all States Members in a spirit of goodwill  cooperation and mutual solidarity in order to take on the challenges that face the world. Indeed  we have adopted that spirit as one of the main tenets of Nepal’s foreign policy.   Nepal is an example of how swords can be turned into ploughshares. That is what the United Nations is dedicated to. Therefore  as I address this Assembly today  I have a special feeling about the objectives and ideals that the United Nations stands for and the correlation between those ideals and the political  economic and social transformation that we would like to achieve in our country. May we all succeed in attaining our common objectives through our collective and sincere efforts as united and inseparable members of a single global family. "
"131",5317,"NRU",63,2008,"I offer my congratulations to Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session. I can assure him that Nauru will lend its full cooperation to him as he leads our work during this time. Also  allow me to take this opportunity to commend his predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Srgjan Kerim  for his leadership of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session.  I wish to reaffirm Nauru’s commitment and abiding faith in the ideals and objectives of the United Nations. We declare our support for the Organization’s efforts to resolve the multiple humanitarian  peace and security and development challenges confronting our world today.  I am grateful for this opportunity to address the Assembly for the first time as President of the Republic of Nauru. I took the challenge of the office fully cognizant of my responsibilities to the people of Nauru. Despite knowing that the road to our economic recovery will be slow and painful  I have committed my Administration to carrying out its duties based on the fundamental principles of democracy  good governance and sound socio-economic policies.  At the beginning of this decade  Nauru was at the brink of total economic collapse. Much has been achieved to improve our economy and to address the resulting social problems. That has been accomplished by implementing a range of fiscal  economic and governance reforms. I am happy to say that Nauru today has stabilized. We are now at the beginning of a rebuilding phase in our history. However  I say this with a degree of caution and regard for the fragility of our situation.   19 08-51839   In order to secure Nauru’s recovery and to ensure rebuilding and development  we will need ongoing assistance from our development partners. We need coordinated assistance targeted at our priorities and in line with our strategies so that we may fulfil our promise for a better quality of life for my people.   Nauru appreciates the financial and material assistance from our development partners  in particular Australia  Taiwan  Japan  New Zealand and the European Union. We appeal for such cooperation to be continued in order to strengthen our nation-building efforts.  Since assuming office  I have been determined that Nauru learn from  and not repeat  the mistakes of the past. As a consequence of mismanagement and corruption  past Administrations took Nauru from what then seemed to be a bright future to standing on the brink of collapse. In that process  national reserves and assets were all lost  and we have been left with an unmanageable burden of domestic and external debt. Nauru will only ever be able to service a very small portion of that debt if we are to ensure ongoing recovery and sustained development. We therefore seek the understanding and consideration of those countries and institutions to which we owe money and appeal to them to allow debt forgiveness or major write-downs. At the same time  we are implementing financial  legislative and constitutional measures to ensure that this never happens again.  Our limited human resources capacity  relative to the enormity of the tasks yet to be accomplished  is a further impediment to our development goals. Improving the quality of education in our schools  promoting trade and skills training  certifying existing skills and encouraging ongoing professional and job-related development are therefore high priorities for my Government. Increasing our human resources capacity will not only serve to address the risk to sustaining our development  but will increase job opportunities for my people  domestically and abroad. With unemployment overall estimated above 30 per cent  and worse among our youth  labour migration and the associated remittances must be seen as part of the range of measures to secure Nauru’s recovery and future.  I appeal to all developed countries with major workforce requirements to open up their job opportunities  reduce barriers to trade in services and promote labour mobility. That can contribute far more to the development of small States than many other traditional forms of aid. Moreover  such measures can be targeted at specific sectors and activities  for fixed time periods and with certain conditions. The New Zealand and Australian unskilled labour schemes for Pacific workers are two prime examples. The United States military expansion in Guam provides another opportunity for significant development assistance to the Pacific. We call on the United States for preferential access to those opportunities. That will require special trade  labour and immigration conditions.  We need to build our human resources capacity to shift Nauru away from its historical reliance on government and public sector employment. Likewise  we must develop the private sector in Nauru. We encourage foreign direct investment  and we welcome assistance in developing diversity and new industries in Nauru. My Government is focused on creating the environment to encourage and facilitate the growth of our private sector.  Nauru’s recovery and future development are particularly vulnerable to external factors. Pacific island developing States are greatly exposed to both the food and the energy security crises. Dependence on imported foods  our remoteness and rising fuel and transport costs have made both food and energy security particularly critical issues for our region.  That is especially true for Nauru. Consider our situation: our island home is fringed by a narrow rim  where my people live just a couple of metres above sea level. The mining of phosphate on Nauru has left large pinnacle rocks covering 80 per cent of the island  which prevents agriculture and contributes to desertification and drought.  Although we place a high priority on the production of nutritious traditional staples  arable land is just too scarce to achieve a sustainable level of food security. The Secretary-General stated in his address yesterday (see ) that at this time last year rice cost $330 a ton and that today it is now $730. Nauru is paying nearly double that. Our imported rice costs us $1 340 a ton. Rice and other staples are simply becoming unaffordable. Without urgent attention to our region  it is estimated that an additional 5 per cent of our people will slip into poverty because of high food prices.    08-51839 20   We need the world to increase food production. That requires investment in training and in implementing appropriate farming techniques  together with efficient seed and fertilizer distribution. We also need increased access to food. That includes reviewing trade policies on food aid.  The energy crisis is anther significant external factor that has an impact on our recovery and the security of our future. Nauru already cannot afford the cost of the fuel required to provide for all its energy needs. As a consequence  my people suffer  with scheduled power cuts of up to eight or more hours every single day. That has an impact on parents’ ability to care for and feed their children. Without power  houses have no running water  adding to health and sanitation problems. Power shedding limits business development and impedes government services and productivity.  The energy crisis is further disproportionately impacting Nauru in terms of transport services. Sea  land and air  passenger and freight: all are fast becoming unaffordable for my people  further isolating our island nation and hindering our sustainable development. We need urgent assistance  both to develop immediate alternative sources of energy and to access economically viable sources of fuel.  The current reliance on fossil fuels for energy has further particular significance for the Pacific small island developing States. It has resulted in emissions that are causing sea-level rise and climate change. This is not scientific theory: we are experiencing the effects right now.  As with the food crisis  Nauru and the Pacific are not contributors to the causes  but we are particularly vulnerable. We will pay the highest costs and are the first countries to feel the direct consequences. Global warming is predicted conservatively to raise sea levels by one metre in this century. That will flood our only habitable land. Our people will be literally trapped between the rising sea and an ancient  uninhabitable coral field.  Despite our many challenges  we are working hard to create a safe and sustainable haven from the rising sea. We must rehabilitate our mined phosphate lands and return them to a habitable  arable state. The cost of rehabilitating 80 per cent of our island is well beyond our immediate means. Rehabilitation of the island is a high priority  and  as part of climate change adaptation  we call for sufficient funding mechanisms  including support from the United Nations and financial and private sector institutions  to help restore our nation and improve our resilience.  To address climate change as a world society  we need to meet much of our energy needs through renewable energy sources  and by reducing emissions from fuels and using cleaner fuels. But as critical as that is for my nation  it is clear to me that the emitting countries have yet to do all they can. We all share the same global climate. It is therefore vital that all countries give much greater impetus to developing alternate energy sources  increase investment and implement real measures to address climate change.  The issue of climate change for Pacific island nations is a threat to international peace and security. The preamble to the United Nations Charter stipulates that a primary purpose of the United Nations is to maintain international peace and security. The Security Council is charged with protecting human rights  together with ensuring the integrity and security of States. It is the paramount international forum available to Pacific island countries in which to draw attention to the dangers that their islands and populations face due to the adverse effects of climate change.  We do not expect the Security Council to become involved in the details of the discussions in the context of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  but we do expect the Security Council to keep the matter under continuous review so as to ensure that all countries contribute to solving the climate change problem and that their efforts match their resources and capacities. We also expect that the Security Council will review particularly sensitive issues such as the implications of the loss of land and resources and the displacement of people for sovereignty and international legal rights.   Nauru has incorporated the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) into its national sustainable development strategy. Pacific island countries  including Nauru  are struggling in many areas of the MDGs as a consequence of the recent fuel and food crises and the effects of climate change.  We lament the fact that the gap between promise and implementation continues to frustrate our achievement of the full range of internationally agreed development goals that are particularly relevant to   21 08-51839  small island developing States. It is extremely distressing that those goals were determined by consensus of the international community yet developed countries have yet to contribute the 0.7 per cent of gross national income committed to assist developing countries in meeting their targets.  On the eve of the high-level event on the Millennium Development Goals  may I call on the United Nations once more to rededicate itself to making development one of the highest priorities of the Organization. I would remind the United Nations of its commitment to open a total of eight new offices in Pacific island countries. We hope that the Organization will not waiver in its commitment to support our national priorities in meeting the MDGs and provide us with the urgently needed international civil servants to help with our pursuit of sustainable development and poverty alleviation.  Sixty-three years after the United Nations was founded on the noble ideals of establishing a peaceful  free and tolerant global order  the world community still suffers from the scourges of war  poverty  oppression and discrimination  even as it faces today’s colossal global challenges that threaten our very existence. If the United Nations is to remain devoted to the ideals upon which it was founded  it is absolutely critical that it be reformed through the revitalization and empowerment of the General Assembly. If the United Nations is to remain a defender of human rights and international peace  it is crucial that the Security Council be expanded to better reflect geo-political realities of the modern world. That would mean giving permanent seats to Japan  India  Germany and Brazil.  If the United Nations prides itself on being an inclusive Organization that champions the rights of everyone  it cannot continue to deny the fundamental right of Taiwan’s 23 million people to participate in the specialized agencies of the United Nations. It is clear to all of us that cross-Strait relations have been improving since May 2008 and that leaders from both sides have openly shown a willingness to work together to create a positive atmosphere. It is now time for the United Nations to find a solution to the exclusion of Taiwan. Only by allowing Taiwan to participate meaningfully in the specialized agencies of the United Nations can the principle of universality and democratization of the Organization be fulfilled  and regional peace and prosperity ensured.  It is very simple and straightforward: we have vowed to the people  now let us keep our promise. "
"132",5364,"NZL",63,2008,"Sixty-three years after its formation  the United Nations remains the world’s central international body. Only here do all countries come together to devise solutions and to forge collective action on global challenges. And these are particularly challenging times. As the Secretary-General and many others have noted  we are facing a global financial crisis  a global energy crisis and a global food crisis. More than ever before  we are an interconnected and interdependent world community. The Charter goals of peace and prosperity require the full support of all United Nations Members. New Zealand was a founding member in 1945  and our commitment to this body is as strong now as it was then.  At such a difficult time in the world we need leadership  courage and a recommitment of our resources to tackle the issues before us. When the food crisis was first in the headlines  the Secretary-General’s High-Level Task Force provided a mechanism for us all to respond. Having contributed nearly $NZ 10 million to date  New Zealand is among those assisting with urgent food security needs and medium-term policy responses. A successful conclusion of the Doha Development Round would alleviate much of the pressure on the demand-supply imbalance.  On the development theme of this sixty-third session  New Zealand fully associates with the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) Global Call to Action Campaign. Support is urgently needed to revitalize collective efforts  including developing and strengthening partnerships between traditional and new donors  the private sector and civil society  and through South-South cooperation. We are set to play our part.  New Zealand is significantly stepping up official development assistance (ODA) from 0.27 per cent of gross national income in 2007 to 0.35 per cent by 2010-2011. That 62 per cent increase will take New Zealand aid to over $NZ 600 million.  We are acutely aware that the Pacific is the second region after sub-Saharan Africa that is least likely to meet the MDG targets. We are therefore looking to direct our increased ODA there  through a Pacific strategy  which focuses poverty reduction efforts around four key pillars: strengthening governance  achieving broader-based growth and sustainable livelihoods  improving health and education  and reducing vulnerabilities  including to climate change.  In these challenging times  we look to the United Nations to deliver effectively for development  for peace and security and on human rights. Our Organization must continue to evolve along with the changing demands on it. Momentum needs to be maintained in the modernization of the United Nations. We share the Secretary-General’s vision for that and support his proposals to fix the human resources management system  which he has characterized as dysfunctional.  I would now like to turn to the challenges of peace and security around the world  from which our own region is not immune. At the Pacific Islands Forum held in Niue last month  New Zealand and other members of the Pacific Forum community expressed profound disappointment at Fiji’s lack of progress towards restoring democratic government. The Forum communiqué urged the interim regime in Fiji to fulfil    08-53141 26  its promise to hold elections in accordance with Fiji’s existing constitution by March next year. Leaders also acknowledged that there were long-term issues to be resolved in Fiji and supported a Commonwealth-led independent and inclusive political dialogue process to address them. That will not only create a more conducive environment for elections  but also enable a newly elected Government to engage with key stakeholders to promote national reconciliation. New Zealand urges all United Nations Members to support the steps taken by the Pacific Islands Forum to encourage Fiji to return to democratic and constitutional government as soon as possible. Mr. Nsengimana (Rwanda)  Vice-President  took the Chair.  Our region is also home to Timor-Leste  a partner and friend of New Zealand. We are pleased to see encouraging progress since last year’s elections  especially the building of institutions and improving governance. That was achieved despite assassination attempts on Timor-Leste’s leadership. The United Nations Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste (UNMIT) and the International Stabilization Force continue to play a valuable role in helping to maintain security. New Zealand strongly supports the UNMIT mandate and its extension beyond February 2009. Planning for security in the longer term  to ensure appropriately sized and resourced institutions with clearly delineated roles and responsibilities  is also a key issue  and we stand ready to help.  Also within our region  the political  economic and human rights situation in Myanmar remains troubling. We urge the Myanmar authorities to achieve national reconciliation through open and constructive dialogue and to respect universal human rights in the country  consistent with international obligations. We support the efforts of the United Nations to sustain a dialogue with the Myanmar Government in order to build foundations for the future.  On the African continent  the humanitarian disaster caused by the conflict in Darfur is unacceptable. The targeting of civilians by State and non-State parties  is a flagrant breach of international human rights law. The widespread absence of justice and accountability for such human rights violations and the impunity that this promotes represent major obstacles to improving the human rights situation in Darfur.  In the case of Zimbabwe  the recent announcement of a power-sharing agreement offers hope that the long period of violent repression and human rights abuses by the previous Government can be brought to a close. The international community will be watching closely to see that all parties fulfil the commitments that they have made to bring about peace  respect for political freedom and human rights and a Government which reflects the will of the people.  Let me turn now to the Middle East. New Zealand continues to be strongly supportive of all attempts to find a lasting solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict. We share the international community’s vision for a viable and territorially contiguous Palestinian State  existing side by side in peace and security with the State of Israel.  In Afghanistan  despite political progress  the overall situation is fragile. The international community needs to devote more resources to ending the conflict and to assisting the people of Afghanistan in their efforts to stabilize and rebuild their country. New Zealand has expressed a strong commitment to restoring peace and security in Afghanistan with our assistance  both military and developmental  totalling more than 160 million New Zealand dollars to date.  Closer to home  New Zealand welcomes the recent improvement in cross-Strait relations. Cross-Strait stability is vital to the security of the greater Asia-Pacific region. We encourage China and Taiwan to maintain the dialogue which has been established.  New Zealand remains a strong supporter of efforts to protect and maintain the international rule of law. To that end  one of the most significant advances in recent times has been the establishment of the International Criminal Court (ICC). When the ICC was first established  it was widely considered to herald the beginning of a new era in international criminal justice. The Court has now reached a crucial stage in its development  and it has become clear that the establishment of a global justice system brings with it many challenges. It is of the utmost importance that States rise to those challenges. To fail to do so would be a betrayal of the victims of egregious crimes. New Zealand urges States to make every effort to ensure the independence and success of the Court. The Court needs our full support and cooperation to ensure that individuals responsible for the most serious violations   27 08-53141  of international law are brought to justice without delay.  In this sixtieth anniversary year of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  we acknowledge the many international human rights conventions that have arisen out of that unique statement of overriding principles. New Zealand played an active part in the design of the new Human Rights Council  and we are seeking election to the Council next year  so as to be more closely involved in its work.  The newest member of the family of human rights treaties is the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities  which New Zealand ratified this month. We look forward to the first conference of States parties  and to the opportunity the Convention offers to make a real improvement in the lives and human rights of disabled people everywhere.  Finally  let me reiterate the importance that New Zealand attaches to the concept of the responsibility to protect. The United Nations  through the Security Council  should be prepared to protect people against ethnic cleansing  genocide  war crimes and crimes against humanity when national authorities fail to do so. There is a clear need to enhance early warning systems to enable the Council to act in a timely manner. We look forward to the report of the Secretary-General on the responsibility to protect  and we stand ready to help to take that important initiative forward.  As we look forward to the year ahead  New Zealand pledges to work actively with others in our collective stewardship of the United Nations. We shall play our part in the continuing  patient process of renewing our Organization and of making it more resilient and responsive. "
"133",5408,"OMN",63,2008,"I have the honour to convey the regards of His Majesty Sultan Qaboos Bin Said of Oman  and his best wishes and appreciation for the efforts to make this session a success.  I am quite hopeful that this session will yield a great deal of understanding on various issues of common interest that shall enhance global security and stability in accordance with the aspirations of the people of the world to achieve prosperity and realize the Millennium Development Goals.  I would also like to seize this opportunity to express my appreciation to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his commendable efforts to improve the performance of this Organization in the interests of the international community.  In that connection  we would like to emphasize the role of international institutions and the need to support their efforts by intensifying cooperation and coordination with them in order to uphold justice and righteousness and to entrench security  peace and stability throughout the world.  Annual sessions of the General Assembly are important events through which Member States have the opportunity to express their concerns and views. There is no doubt that the efforts to preserve the environment have remained a top international priority  particularly in view of developments in recent years  during which the effects of climate change have been felt across the world.  The international community has made numerous efforts in that respect  the most salient of which includes Agenda 21  adopted at the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Brazil  and the Bali Road Map adopted at the 2007 Conference to the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Indonesia. Those efforts are designed to deepen understanding and awareness of climate change and to improve weather forecasting in order to save lives and property  to discourage human practices that are detrimental to the environment and to educate people to live in harmony with it.   More than ever before  however  we are called upon to intensify and double our efforts and joint cooperation in order to deal with such circumstances in a constructive and practical way. We must support purposeful scientific research aimed at finding creative means  policies and plans to guarantee a stable and sustainable environment while taking into account physical evidence related to climatic cycles and environmental change through the ages. We hope that the fourteenth climate change Conference  to be held in Copenhagen next year  will produce practical and useful recommendations that meet our hopes and aspirations.  Economic development and trade among nations have helped build bridges of communication based on mutual benefits and common interests. The current trade system  however  is in dire need of a vision and systems that keep pace with economic transformations and with emerging economic entities in order to maintain the balance of the global economy and to cater to the needs of developing countries.  Large industrial countries need to lift trade restrictions on the exports of developing countries and to share with them modern technologies  effective marketing mechanisms  and educational and scientific frameworks that guarantee meaningful human development everywhere. The World Trade Organization (WTO) should play a more effective role towards the removal of trade restrictions and the application of appropriate policies so as to create a freer trade environment.  While we welcome the invitation by the Director-General of the WTO  Mr. Pascal Lamy  to hold another round of trade negotiations in the context of the Doha Development Agenda  we would like to emphasize that such negotiations should rely on WTO rules that are rooted in equity and justice.  Everyone knows that the Palestinians are suffering the repercussions of tragic human circumstances that have deprived them of their right to a life of dignity. The harsh Israeli policies of closures  the erection of checkpoints and the perpetuation of settlement activities make the daily lives of Palestinians very difficult. Those practices also undermine efforts and initiatives to achieve peace and stability. Indeed  they call into question the credibility  A/63/PV.13 21 08-53122  of Israel’s desire to seek a real solution to end the conflict.  We urge the international community to step up its efforts to make Israel shoulder its responsibilities  in view of the importance and inevitability of peace as the only option for joint and harmonious coexistence between all peoples of the region. It has become clear that there can be no peace without the restoration of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people  foremost of which is their right to live safely on their land and in their independent State  side by side with Israel and within internationally recognized boundaries.  Our commitment to peace is strategic and fundamental. Ensuring peace is a collective responsibility of the international community that should be forcefully and selflessly shouldered  regardless of the difficulties encountered. On that basis  the Sultanate of Oman  in the context of its friendly relations and cooperation with many countries  is ever eager to promote long-term relations as a fundamental pillar of joint efforts in support of peace  security  dialogue  mutual understanding and harmony.  The progress made towards Lebanese reconciliation is an achievement that invites optimism. While we praise the efforts made by the State of Qatar and all other Arab States  as well as by the League of Arab States  we call upon all Lebanese parties to implement the Doha Agreement in order to safeguard the higher interests of the brotherly Lebanese people. We also welcome the visit to Syria by Lebanese President Michel Sleiman and its positive outcome  including the agreement to establish diplomatic ties between the two countries.  With regard to the situation in Iraq  we note with satisfaction the relative improvements in the country’s security conditions. We hope that the situation will continue to improve until stability prevails throughout Iraq. We also hope for continued efforts by the Iraqi Government and all political forces to reach a comprehensive national understanding that can unite all sectors of Iraqi society and restore harmony and concord to its national and social fabric.  As for the situation in the Sudanese region of Darfur  we welcome the steps being taken by the Sudanese Government  in cooperation with the African Union and the League of Arab States  to establish peace and stability in the region. We therefore call upon the international community to support those efforts in order to help build a national consensus among all brotherly Sudanese citizens.  From this rostrum  we reiterate our call to all Somali parties to cease fighting and to refrain from any actions that could hamper sound diplomatic efforts. We also hope that all parties will abide by the agreement reached in Djibouti on 9 June 2008.  In addition  we call for continued consultations between the Islamic Republic of Iran and other States on the Iranian nuclear issue. We hope that those efforts will result in an agreement that upholds Iran’s right to use nuclear technology for peaceful purposes  while eliminating the concerns of a number of States regarding the Iranian nuclear programme.  The Games of the XXIX Olympiad  hosted by the friendly People’s Republic of China in Beijing  were unique in terms of their organization  which definitely made that international sports event a great success. The Games have enriched human civilization in all of its beautiful cultural diversity. We wish to take this opportunity to express our best wishes for the next Olympic Games  which will be hosted by the United Kingdom in London in 2012  as well as our hope that they will continue to contribute to human and cultural coexistence among all nations.  The progress that has already been made in the field of collaborative international endeavours encourages us to make further collective efforts to address the challenges facing us and to protect the peoples of the world from their political  economic and social repercussions. We also wish to emphasize the importance of a joint commitment to the establishment of justice and the rule of law. Governments must shoulder their responsibilities in a spirit of positive cooperation  understanding and mutual respect  which are basic principles of international peace and security.  In closing  I wish the President of the General Assembly the best of luck in leading the present session to a successful conclusion. I should like to reaffirm the support of the Sultanate of Oman for efforts to ensure the welfare of all nations and future generations. We hope that all of this will be achieved in an atmosphere of cooperation  harmony and love. "
"134",5455,"PAK",63,2008,"I come before the Assembly today in the name of my late wife  Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto  as a victim of terrorism representing a nation that is a victim of terrorism. I am a husband who has seen the mother of his children give her life fighting the menaces of terrorism and fanaticism  which haunt the entire civilized world. In her place and in her honour  I come before the Assembly as the elected President of a democratic Pakistan who received a mandate from two thirds of our Parliament    08-51851 16  and assemblies. That extraordinary mandate of support was a vote of confidence in her  in her doctrine and in her message. The vote was an act of love and a demand for a democratic  moderate  modern  tolerant and economically just Pakistan — the essence of the Bhutto doctrine.  It has been 11 months since the first attack on my wife  on 18 October 2007  was followed by the adoption of a United Nations resolution calling for an inquiry into that crime against humanity. That United Nations resolution has so far been ineffective. After her assassination  on 27 December  the international community demanded an independent inquiry — a demand supported by resolutions adopted in Pakistan’s Parliament and four provincial legislatures.  Today  we still do not know what forces and institutions were involved — who plotted and planned and coordinated and trained and paid for the murder of my wife  my nation’s beloved leader. A United Nations investigation into the murder of the leader of the people of Pakistan would reassure them that the international community cares about them and that the United Nations Charter of justice is more than rhetoric. We owe it to her. We owe it to history. If a country’s President and his children cannot obtain justice through the United Nations  how will the poor and the dispossessed around the world find reassurance that the United Nations is capable of protecting the weak and the suffering?  In the name of humanity and in the name of justice  the Organization must move forward quickly with the investigation into the assassination of Shaheed Benazir Bhutto so that  once and for all  the people of Pakistan and the rest of the world will know whose bloody hands took away one of the greatest women in history.   My wife courageously returned to Pakistan last year  openly confronting the forces of terror. Three million people turned out to welcome Benazir and the return of democracy to Pakistan. She was a brave woman who understood the dynamics of our region and the world — who understood the interrelationship between politics and economics  between social injustice and political dictatorship. For years  she told world leaders that dictatorship fuels extremism and that poverty fuels fanaticism. She outlined the Bhutto doctrine of reconciliation  so brilliantly presented in her last book. The Bhutto doctrine sets out a dual mission of combating dictatorship and terrorism while promoting social and economic reform and justice for the people of Pakistan. Benazir Bhutto understood that democracy was not an end  but a beginning; that a starving child has no human rights; that a father who cannot support his family is someone ripe for extremism.   Mr. Win (Myanmar)  Vice-President took the Chair.   The Bhutto doctrine of reconciliation is a road map not only to a new Pakistan  but to a new era of peace and cooperation between East and West and among people of all faiths. It is a road map that  if followed  will enable us to avoid the clash of civilizations and the clash of religions  which is the terrorists’ ultimate goal.  The Bhutto doctrine is the new century’s equivalent of the Marshall Plan  which saved Europe after the Second World War. While the Marshall Plan was based on the principle that an economically sound Europe could and would resist communism  the pillar of the Bhutto doctrine is that an economically viable Pakistan will be the centrepiece of the victory of pluralism over terrorism. The Bhutto doctrine will ultimately prove to be as critical to the victory of freedom in this century as the Marshall Plan was critical to the triumph of liberty in the last. Ours is the doctrine of reconciliation; theirs is the doctrine of death.  Her killers thought that her elimination would end her dream of a democratic Pakistan and that the Balkanization of our region would enable the forces of darkness to prevail. But our nation rallied in the aftermath of her brutal and tragic assassination. If Al-Qaida and the Taliban believed that  by silencing Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto  they were silencing her message  they were very wrong. We have picked up the torch and will fight against terrorists who attack us and terrorists who use our territory to plan attacks against our neighbours or anywhere in the world.  Ours is a bloody fight  and neither the personal pain that my children and I feel nor the pain of a nation that has been robbed of its greatest asset  its greatest leader  can be fully expressed. But the terrorists’ lust for blood and hate has not been satisfied. Only last week  the forces of evil struck again in a bloody and cowardly attack against my people. A suicide truck   17 08-51851  bomb destroyed a great building in our capital  barely a stone’s throw away from my office and the House of Parliament.  Once again  Pakistan is the great victim in the war on terror. And once again  our people wonder whether we stand alone. Thousands of our soldiers and civilians have died fighting against the common enemies of humanity. We have lost more soldiers than all the 37 countries combined that have forces in Afghanistan.  The roots of today’s terrorism can be traced to a war involving the world’s super-Powers in Afghanistan during the 1980s. Afghanistan and Pakistan — and  increasingly  the entire world — are reaping the bitter harvest sown towards the end of the cold war. The world turned its back on Afghanistan after the Soviet defeat. In Pakistan  we were left with 3 million refugees within our borders. Their camps soon became breeding grounds for intolerance and violence. The world left South and Central Asia. We were left to live with the consequences. And one of the greatest of those consequences was the birth of Al-Qaida and the Talibanization of Afghanistan and parts of our tribal areas.  Yet  we do not look back at history. We are victims  but we will never be vanquished. On the contrary  the more of our children’s blood they spill  the stronger is our determination to defeat them. We in Pakistan stand united and in defiance. We are resolved that our future will not be dictated by those who distort the spirit and laws of Islam for their sordid politics and political goals.  We may be the targets of international terrorism  but we will never succumb to it. Towards that end  we reach out to this Assembly and to the entire civilized world. Terrorism cannot be fought by military means alone. Fighting it requires political will  popular mobilization and a socio-economic strategy that wins the hearts and minds of nations afflicted by it.  Unilateral actions of great Powers should not inflame the passions of allies. Violating our nation’s sovereignty is not helpful in eliminating the terrorist menace. Indeed  such actions could have the opposite effect.  Many participants in this great Hall today read about terror  while we live it. We do not learn about terror from reading newspapers or watching the evening news. We see our children and our wives being blown up before us. Our cities  neighbourhoods  streets  hotels and offices bear the brunt of the terrorist fanatic rage every single day.   A democratic Pakistan is in the process of reaching the national consensus necessary to confront and defeat the terrorists. Only a democratic Government can win this war. We are fighting the menace and we will continue to do so. But this fight is for the peace of the world. This fight is for the future of generations to come. Yes  we fight for ourselves  for our children  for our very soul. Yes  this war is our war  but we need the moral  political and economic support of the international community. In our stability lies the world’s security. Globalization is not just economic; it is also political. The terrorist vision strikes out at all nations. We must draw a line on their rampage. And we must draw that line in Pakistan.  The question I ask the world’s leaders in this august Hall is whether they will stand with us  just as we stand for the entire civilized world on the frontlines of this epic struggle of the new millennium.  I stand before this Assembly as the President of a great nation that just recently  in a decade of brutal military dictatorship  suffered human rights abuses and the systematic destruction of the foundations of democracy and civil society. Sadly  all too often  the world stood silent as dictators ruled our people with a bloody fist. Nations that were founded on democracy were silent for reasons of expediency. My wife would say that they danced with dictators.  Today  as we meet here in New York  the democratically elected leader of Myanmar  Aung San Suu Kyi  continues to be imprisoned in Yangon. She has suffered year after year under house arrest. The world must demand that that great woman finally be freed. We appreciate the efforts of Mrs. Laura Bush in that regard.  Today  the horror of terrorism that plagues our nation and threatens the world is a by-product of the lack of commitment to the values of democracy. When the world betrays democracy  it sets the table for disaster. We will all continue to pay the price.  In these early years of the new millennium  there are two great battles before mankind. First  there is the battle for democracy and liberty against dictators  the fight for universal human rights. That is the hallmark    08-51851 18  of this Organization. At the same time  we are fighting in the trenches of the battle that will determine the course of this century — the battle against extremism and terrorism  between the forces of ignorance and the forces of education  between bigotry and tolerance  between justice and discrimination  between confrontation and reconciliation.  Democracy is not like a switch that can be turned on and off when it is convenient. It is a universal value guaranteed to all men and women. The outcome of these struggles will determine whether the noble experiment embodied in the hallowed halls of the United Nations will succeed or fail. The struggle between the Bhutto doctrine of reconciliation and the terrorists’ doctrine of death will determine the future of mankind. Let not the extremists who would manipulate Islam for their political ends define us to the world. They are rabid but they are few. It is time for the world to take notice. We are not the cause of the problem of terrorism; we are its victims.  We are an aggrieved nation  not one that has caused grief. We have largely fought this battle alone. We have shared our airbases  our airspace  our intelligence and our armed forces in a coordinated effort to contain terrorism.  It is time for the developed world to step up to the plate to help us and in turn help itself. The fight against terrorism and extremism is a fight for the hearts and minds of people. It cannot be won by guns and bombs alone. The fight must be multifaceted. The battleground must be economic and social as well as military.   We will win when people are mobilized against fanatics. To mobilize them  we have to give them hope and opportunity for their future. They need jobs. Their children need education. They must be fed. They must have energy. We must give people a stake in their own government and we must demonstrate to them that democracy works  that democratic governance can improve their everyday life.  An economically viable Pakistan will be a stable Pakistan. And a stable Pakistan will suck the oxygen out of the terrorist agenda. Economic justice and political democracy are the worst nightmares of terrorists. We must all fight this epic battle together as allies and partners.   But just as we will not let Pakistan’s territory be used by terrorists for attacks against our people and our neighbours  so we cannot allow our territory and our sovereignty to be violated by our friends. Attacks within Pakistan that violate our sovereignty actually serve to empower the forces against which we fight together.   I am a democratic President of a democratic country that intends to be a model to our region and to our religion. I am the President of a vibrant  modern  tolerant  peaceful  moderate democracy committed to economic and social justice. People  including my wife  died for this movement. We will not waste their sacrifices.   We will work patiently to convince leaders in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) and our Pakhtunkhwa province to accept the writ of the Government and turn their back on terrorists. The terrorists may blow up our girls’ schools but we will rebuild them  brick by brick  inch by inch. We are in this battle to win and we know how we have to do it.  We will work together with our neighbours in Afghanistan and with the NATO forces stationed there to ensure security for our common border. We will continue the composite dialogue with India so that our outstanding disputes are resolved. As I discussed with the Indian Prime Minister yesterday  whether it is the core issue of Jammu and Kashmir or cooperation on water resources  India and Pakistan must and will accommodate each other’s concerns and interests. We must respect and work with each other to peacefully resolve our problems and build South Asia into a common market of trade and technology.  Better relations between Pakistan  Afghanistan and India would help create a regional environment more conducive to reducing militancy in our region. But let me be clear to those in this Hall and to the terrorists lurking in their caves  plotting their next assault on humanity. If necessary  we will confront evil with force — our police  our army and our air force. We will turn the power of the State against the stateless terrorists. We will turn the power of justice against the chaos of anarchists. We will turn the power of right against the darkness of evil.  I did not come to the office of President  to this moment  by design. As my wife once said about herself  I did not choose this life — it chose me. An   19 08-51851  extraordinary combination of circumstances brought me to this moment. It has not been an easy road.   I spent nine years in prison  in solitary confinement  as a hostage to my wife’s struggle for democracy and to our party’s future. I was unjustly imprisoned under a judicial system manipulated and controlled by the forces of dictatorship. I refused to break under pressure. My years in prison made me a stronger person and hardened my resolve to fight for democracy and justice. Those years prepared me for this moment.  Terror took my wife’s life  but the terrorists cannot kill my wife’s dream. Her vision  her passion and her force are now our common task. The Benazir Bhutto doctrine of reconciliation lives on; it guides us in our endeavours. Her reconciliation is the mantra of the new era. I am dedicated to implementing what she proposed. I wish I could do it at my wife’s side  but now I will do it in my wife’s place.  Pakistan will prove wrong all the negative predictions about its future. We will show the way by overcoming suspicions towards and from our neighbours and building a future for our people.   Throughout her life  my wife struggled to make the world a better place for our children  the children of Pakistan and the children of the world. I owe it to her memory and to all of the martyrs of democracy to continue to do the same until the Bhutto doctrine of reconciliation is not just her dream but the world’s reality. "
"135",5498,"PAN",63,2008,"My first words are addressed to the President of the General Assembly  at its sixty-third session  my friend Miguel d’Escoto. I am pleased that the responsibility of presiding over our deliberations has fallen to a distinguished Latin American of such political and diplomatic eminence in his country and in the region.  The President has invited us — and because of its great importance we are obliged to comply with his suggestion — to focus our debate on the impact of the world food crisis on poverty and hunger in the world.   This Organization was founded at the end of a world conflagration in order to banish war forever and to prevent armed confrontations between nations or groups of nations. Although it has not been possible to avoid all such events  certainly it has acted as a deterrent force that has prevented wars that might have proved even more devastating. The nations of the world decided that it would be here that conflicts among its Members would be resolved.   Now we have to act on a conflict that is not between Member States  but is rather one of all States against hunger and poverty. It is difficult to explain why  if the world is producing sufficient food for all  854 million people find themselves in a state of food insecurity and more than 1.7 billion people are suffering from iron deficiency. In the last few days we have noted how hundreds of millions of dollars have been directed to rescue commercial enterprises  while we still view with indifference the fact that every year 5.6 million children younger than 5 years are dying directly or indirectly because of malnutrition — that is 640 each hour. In other words  since the moment when we began our deliberations this morning  5 000 children younger than 5 years have died. They did not die because of terrorist acts  which all condemn  nor because of natural disasters  which we all regret. They died for a reason as simple as it is tragic — they were poor. This situation is simply indefensible.  As part of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  we undertook to reduce the number of people suffering from hunger by one half and the number of people who live with an income of less than $1 per day by one half between 1990 and 2015. How can we meet this objective if the price of rice has risen by 74 per cent and that of wheat by 130 per cent? How can we meet this objective if more than one billion people who have escaped extreme poverty run the risk of suffering from hunger unless we do something to stop this upward spiral of food prices?  What is the point of ensuring that more people earn more than a dollar a day if the rise in food prices has in fact altered that measurement of extreme poverty? I do not want to suggest that nothing is being done. The World Food Programme is doing formidable work and donor countries have made extraordinary contributions to alleviate the crisis and bring food to the countries that need it most.   The deliberations of the Human Rights Council  the High-level Conference on World Food Security held at the headquarters of the Food and Agriculture Organization and the meeting of the High-level Task Force on the Global Food Security Crisis constitute additional expressions of the concern of international bodies.  But the fact is that we face a reality that has already caused social disruption and to which no immediate solution is in sight. The major mission of the United Nations is the preservation of peace  and peace is not just the absence of armed conflict between countries  but also lies in the tranquillity of nations and entails the elimination of adverse factors that may disturb that tranquillity.   As if skyrocketing food prices were not enough  they have now been compounded by unjustified speculation  which has raised the price of fuel to absurd levels. It is no longer just the exorbitant earnings of oil companies that are at stake; what is at stake now is the hunger of millions of people who have seen their efforts and hopes go up in smoke without even knowing what has hit them.  This means that we must see to it that from the United Nations reforms that have been so often postponed there emerges a strengthened General Assembly so that  as an expression of all its membership  it may act with authority in response to such situations as those before us today. The Constitution of almost all States of the world provides for the declaration of a state of emergency as a mechanism for dealing with imminent threats to national security or to social harmony.   19 08-51606   I am convinced  and I want to say so today  that because of the price of food  we are facing a threat to social peace and that the General Assembly could so declare it so that all governmental forces  private initiatives and international bodies may coordinate their efforts in a crusade to rescue hundreds of millions of people from the clutches of poverty.  The world food price crisis cannot be dissociated from climate change  as if these two problems were not interrelated. Climate change has led to irregular crops through droughts and floods that have had such a severe effect on food stocks.  If the problem of the scarcity and the lack of food is something that we have to deal with comprehensively  we should take measures to mitigate the polluting effects of carbon  at least by market mechanisms or a limiting of carbon production. It is indispensable to develop more efficient technologies  such as wind and solar energy  to take the place of fossil fuels  if our response is not to remain a temporary palliative but may offer a lasting  sustainable solution; we must see to it  without further delay  that we tackle both problems  the food crisis and climate change  in an integral  comprehensive and consistent manner.  It is only thus that we will be able  without further delay  to arrive at responses that are not just stopgaps  but lasting  sustainable solutions. Indeed  ever-greater importance is to be attached to the way we relate to the ecosystems that sustain life throughout the world  and how that affects the survival of our species and civilization.   We must understand that the environmental agenda of the twenty-first century cannot be built on the basis of the idea of a conflict between the environment and the market  nor between the environment and trade barriers  but on the basis of opportunities which the market and trade offer to stimulate new ways of addressing the environmental issues that affect us all.  We know today that there is no intractable contradiction between conservation and development  as perhaps there might have appeared to be when the United Nations convened the first meeting to discuss the subject in 1972. Let us make no mistake. The opposite of conservation is not development  but waste. It is clear from the intimate relationship that exists between environmental problems and those that have to do with social and economic development that the best way to promote natural capital is to promote social capital.  The only way to create a different environment is to build a society free of the problems of poverty  underdevelopment and ignorance which today limit our capacity to establish harmonious relations among all social sectors  and between them and their natural environment.  We have the resources to do it: technology  scientific knowledge and  above all  political leadership and innovative capacity. But we can only succeed through a common approach to environmental management  shared by all the members of the global community who are already moving in this same direction.  The international community has been happy to see that on the other side of the Pacific  tensions have abated  but we note with concern that threats to international peace and security have emerged in other parts of the world.   Panama has set forth its positions in the Security Council. I shall therefore only refer to what was also suggested by the President  that is  the need to democratize this Organization.  Over the last four years  I have heard from countless speakers a widespread demand for the United Nations to finally adapt its structures  which the 50 signatories of the original Charter designed 60 years ago  to the reality of an Organization with 192 Member States and a geopolitical situation very different from that which then existed.  It has become a ritual repeated year after year for every Head of State  foreign minister or ambassador to call  without much success  for a recrafting of the Organization. For myself  as is shown by the commitment of my country to the United Nations  for the fifth time in five years  I come to this podium to ask with the same vigour and energy for the political will to implement reforms.  Panama made a proposal  which  like all the others  could not be the subject of consensus. We still stand by it. We stand by the idea that this Organization must modernize itself  and soon. We cannot allow a situation where  in the absence of agreement  we end up by abandoning the spirit of reform that has inspired us up till now.    08-51606 20   I propose therefore that we agree  before the end of the decade  upon initial fundamental reforms which will begin to turn the wheels of modernization. There are numerous examples in different parts of the world  as well as in my own experience as a member of the Government  that allow me to assure members that small reforms  which may appear insignificant to begin with  eventually lead to other  more profound reforms. We must start somewhere.  I would like to express my gratitude to the General Assembly for granting my country  Panama  the honour of non-permanent membership of the Security Council over the past two years. Panamanian diplomats and jurists contributed to the drafting of the Charter of the United Nations and  since that time  Panama’s representatives have contributed the wealth of their experience so that the principles which inspired the Charter can continue to prevail. You may rest assured that we will not rest until this Organization  so vital for peace in the world and the sole hope for millions of the poor  is finally endowed with a legal structure appropriate for the twenty-first century."
"136",5545,"PER",63,2008,"I should like to begin by greeting you  Sir  congratulating you on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session. We are certain that your experience will enable us to have fruitful and constructive exchanges on the urgent challenges currently facing humanity. Thus  we reaffirm our commitment to contributing to the achievement of positive results during this session.  Fighting poverty and creating opportunities to promote social inclusion are priorities of the Government of President Alan García Pérez  and we are therefore pleased that the General Assembly has rightly chosen the theme of poverty — a challenge requiring a global and comprehensive response — as the central focus of discussion for the present session.   Peru has been affected by the negative repercussions of the increase in food and fuel prices  which are felt most intensely by the poorest individuals. In my country  we are working responsibly to find appropriate responses that can sustainably meet the challenge of enhancing food security. At the same time  we are adopting urgent measures to assist those most affected by rising food prices. The direct relationship between poverty and rising food prices should lead us to develop new and more ambitious formulas for international cooperation that are commensurate with the magnitude of the problem and take into account all aspects of poverty in a comprehensive manner.   Against that backdrop  I wish to highlight a new threat to the possibilities of development: a grave international financial crisis whose scale is still unknown. At its roots lies an unfortunate and irresponsible combination of regulatory loopholes  real estate inflation  reckless mortgages and financial leverages without a sound basis in the real economy. This could lead the world into a crisis of confidence and undermine the considerable progress that developing regions have made in their fight against poverty. Given those phenomena  we await decisive responses and actions by the developed countries to support the financial system and avert the great risks of this crisis.   In the case of Peru  I can say that this turbulence will not cause us to abandon our ongoing policies of investing  creating productive jobs  increasing tax revenues and promoting growth. Peru has been very successfully implementing a programme of comprehensive  inclusive and decentralized development based on two pillars: an economic policy A/63/PV.13   08-53122 6  with the clear objectives of growth and job creation  taking advantage of the country’s multifaceted potential; and a social policy that honours the commitment to reduce poverty  increase social inclusion and promote equality of opportunity.  That approach has brought into our economy not only financial resources  but also advanced technologies and management capacities that improve and stimulate the competitiveness of our production  thus increasing and diversifying exportation. As a result of that approach  the creation of direct and indirect employment has increased in an unprecedented way in many areas of the country and thousands of small and medium entrepreneurs have been incorporated into the market in an economy that boosts initiative and creative capacity.   Based on those premises  Peru has made steady progress in recent years  with the growth rate reaching 9.1 per cent in 2007 and forecast to reach over 9 per cent this year. There is  further  a major increase in the domestic component  which is a driving force in the economy.  But to those positive macroeconomic figures we should add the important results in the management of the major components of the social model  such as the expanding social  education and health services as well as basic assistance to the poorest. Through the social policy  the Peruvian Government has achieved  in only two years  a remarkable reduction of more than 5 per cent in poverty and almost 3 per cent in extreme poverty. Infant mortality has also fallen by 51.6 per cent and illiteracy levels have also been reduced by 5.7 per cent. We have also established an objective of reducing chronic child malnutrition by 5 per cent by 2011. We are seeking to enhance the management and increase the impact of the social expenditures of the State.  Those achievements ensure that in the case of Peru the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) will be met prior to the 2015 deadline in areas such as poverty reduction  nutrition  literacy  health and education  among others. We also see that the role of international cooperation was fundamental in our being able to bring to remote areas social  education and production projects that  in a sustainable manner  raise the standard of living of members of rural communities. The combination of the national effort for inclusion and international cooperation should be maintained in order to achieve  as soon as possible  the full involvement of the Peruvian social fabric in national development.   In recognition of all of those advances  of the economic stability of the country and of the prevailing legal security  three important international risk indicators have given Peru its investment grade. Consistent with this positive evolution of the economic perception of my country  foreign investment increased by more than 23 per cent in 2007 and is expected to further increase this year.  Our growth is also based on expanding the markets  which we have done through regional and bilateral free trade agreements entered into with the United States  Chile  Thailand  Canada and Singapore. We hope to conclude further agreements soon with South Korea and China. We are conducting trade negotiations with the European Union and the Andean countries  a process that we hope will be satisfactorily concluded in 2009. Furthermore  we are ready to engage in negotiations with as many countries as possible  to enable us to boost trade.  There is a broad consensus regarding the shared responsibility of countries of origin and receiving countries in dealing with the phenomenon of migration. Its causes have a global dimension  and so should its treatment. It is a tool of development  both in originating and receiving countries and in the migrant communities themselves. We should look at the central role of migration in terms of creating opportunities for generating wealth and progress  for diversity and for building more tolerant multicultural spaces.  The responsible and constructive handling of international migration should begin with the practical use of international instruments for the protection of migrants. Therefore  the United Nations  together with States  must redouble its efforts to implement measures that will make it possible to ensure respect for the human rights of migrants  migrant workers and their families.   For this reason  in Peru we have been promoting and continue to promote the handling of this matter both in the United Nations and in other forums with a view to establishing mechanisms for exchange of information and specialized knowledge  undertaking standing consultations and forging closer cooperation between the Global Forum for Migration and Development and the United Nations. We must make  A/63/PV.13 7 08-53122  civil society aware of the benefits and contributions of migration and continue with dialogue and coordination in multilateral forums  without stopping the progress towards agreements.  The concern about poverty and economic growth requires an examination of the sustainability of development ideas and the most relevant environmental priorities. We need to deal with security and the rational use of water for agriculture and for personal use  deforestation control  soil degradation and environmental pollution  among others. We are working on these issues with the most advanced regulations  a product of our own experience. We have to approach these matters organically. In the case of Peru  we established the Ministry for the Environment a few months ago. We insist that national development programmes take account of the quality of life and the sustainability of land-use models and of natural resources.   Global warming requires us to work intensively with the entire international community to reduce emissions  which are the fundamental reason for the rise in global temperatures and their already visible consequences. Peru is witnessing a rapid retreat of its tropical glaciers  which is threatening the water-supply regime in the most populated and heavily agricultural areas. We want to confirm our conviction on the pressing importance of advancing from the platform adopted in Bali last year with a view to consolidating in Copenhagen in 2009 a comprehensive agreement for the reduction of polluting emissions  in order to avoid the worst natural-catastrophe scenarios for a not-so-distant future.  The current international scene presents a very complicated structure  characterized by contradictory trends of globalization and fragmentation. Indeed  on the one hand  we have global integration of production processes  trade  financial flows and technological revolution  as well as the dissemination of values such as democracy and human rights. But  simultaneously  there is fragmentation because of increasing social inequality  poverty  exclusion  proliferation of civil wars  genocide  terrorism  transnational crime  degradation of the environment and the flouting of international law as a means for the peaceful settlement disputes.   Those contradictory trends between globalization and fragmentation jeopardize the governance of States  the governance of the international system and collective security itself. Peru  true to its traditional constructive approach  considers that the international order should be based on peace  cooperation  multilateralism and  of course  international law. Thus we are of the view that at the present time we need to reaffirm support for the primordial role played by the United Nations in dealing with the major subjects on the international agenda  specifically those connected with international peace and security  the observance of democratic order  sustainable development  the promotion and protection of human rights  and environmental protection.  That approach guided Peruvian participation on the Security Council and has led it to reaffirm its commitment to active participation in peacekeeping operations in the context of respect for the principles of the sovereignty of States and non-intervention in the domestic affairs of other countries. Currently  my country’s armed forces are in Haiti  the Sudan  the Democratic Republic of the Congo  Liberia and Côte d’Ivoire. Peru has a contingent in the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti and is coordinator of the Group of Friends of Haiti  which is responsible for helping the Security Council in monitoring this case.  Moreover  Peru is an active participant in numerous multilateral mechanisms. This year  we were honoured to host the fifth Summit between the European Union and Latin American and Caribbean heads of State and Government. Next November  we will once again be honoured when we host leaders from the economies of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum at their sixteenth summit.   As part of our involvement on the international stage  I should also like to point to our contribution to the establishment of the Latin American-Pacific Arc  which aims at harnessing synergies among participating countries in economic and commercial fields  especially as regards promoting investments in the areas of infrastructure and facilitating business  and in promoting cooperation to improve the competitiveness of our economies. All of that is geared towards ensuring a more pronounced and effective presence for our region in the Asia-Pacific region.   In conclusion  I would like to reiterate Peru’s commitment to continue to support initiatives aimed at promoting an environment conducive to economic and social development  the full validity of democracy  the A/63/PV.13   08-53122 8  strengthening of the rule of law and the promotion and protection of human rights throughout the world. That should take place against an international backdrop where conflicts are brought under control  security prevails and there is unequivocal adherence to the norms of international law and the Charter of the United Nations. Those are the central priority goals of our foreign policy and constitute the guidelines that will continue to orient Peru’s participation on the international stage  and especially in this body."
"137",5592,"PHL",63,2008,"The developing world is at a tipping point. In the Philippines  we feel the pain of high prices of food  fuel and rice. Our people pursue the universal dream of a better life for themselves and their children: better education  better health care  higher wages  a dignified retirement. We are proving the value of a new paradigm for self-reliance through the use of  first  a targeted strategy with a set of precise prescriptions to ease our price challenges; secondly  food self-sufficiency and more energy independence; and thirdly  long-term reforms. This is a positive example that we wish to share with the rest of the world.  Our gains over the past seven years were hard-earned. We made tough and sometimes painful decisions to reset our economy: tax increases  banking reforms  a crackdown on smugglers and tough fiscal discipline  to name a few. Thankfully  these reforms have given us some running room to weather the first wave of global price shocks that reverberated across the world earlier this year.   15 08-51570   It has not been easy  but Filipinos are tough and resilient. We have pulled together. We have been able to draw on additional revenues to provide targeted investments in food and fuel to keep our poor afloat until a better day. But we are also realistic and know that we cannot do it alone. We need a strong United Nations as never before. We need rigorous international cooperation as never before.  Economic uncertainty has moved like a tsunami around the globe  wiping away gains  erasing progress  not just here on Manhattan island  but also in the many islands of the Philippines. Just when we thought the worst had passed  the light at the end of the tunnel became an oncoming train hurtling forward with new shocks to the global financial system. The setbacks from these global shocks of the past year — and of the past weeks — are real and profound. It will take time and perseverance to put the pieces back together.  To address these global challenges  we must go on building bridges among allies around the globe in order to bring the rice to where it is needed to feed the people  to make investments to create jobs  and to keep the peace and maintain stability in the world.  It is therefore timely that the Secretary-General  Ban Ki-moon  has organized this year’s agenda around the impact of the global economy on the poor. He deserves our highest praise for his quick and decisive action on the global food crisis. His Comprehensive Framework for Action  involving the United Nations  donor countries  civil society and the private sector  seeks to achieve food security through the right combination of policies  technologies and investments. This is a model of the United Nations in action.  Since the volatile global economic situation became apparent many months ago  in the Philippines we have increased and stabilized the supply of rice and delivered targeted subsidies to the poor. We have reached out to neighbours such as Viet Nam and others in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and elsewhere to ensure a stable supply and affordable prices. We have clamped down on price gouging and invested additional billions in planting and agricultural modernization.  We have increased our energy independence by 17 per cent through greater use of geothermal energy  biofuels and other renewable sources  and we expect to attain 60 per cent energy independence in two years. Biofuels have been cited as being a positive factor for clean energy. At the same time  they have also been cited as a negative factor that contributes to high food prices. We are pursuing a policy of using non-food biofuel sources planted on land unusable for food production purposes. We see this approach as a way for countries to seek a sustainable balance between food and energy needs.   For food self-sufficiency  our food baskets are North Luzon in our largest island and the southern island of Mindanao. Mindanao has fields of the highest productivity  yet also the majority of our poorest provinces. It is a sad irony that our food basket has some of the highest incidences of hunger in our nation.   The prime reason is the endless Mindanao conflict. Our archipelago of 7 000 islands has had its share of religious strife  ethnic tension and violence. For years  we have worked to achieve peace in Mindanao. Much progress was made until violent elements within the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) decided to take the law into their own hands. We will restart the dialogue when the area is secure  when our people are safe and when responsible elements in the MILF regain control.  There is no alternative to peace. I stand before the Assembly today to declare loud and clear that we are committed to the process of peace in Mindanao. We gratefully acknowledge here today the central role of so many friends and allies  including the United Nations; Brunei Darussalam  Indonesia  Libya  Malaysia  Saudi Arabia and others in the Organization of the Islamic Conference; Australia  New Zealand  the United States and other bilateral partners supplying official development assistance; and the European Union and Sweden. All have played a big role in advancing peace and development in Mindanao.  We will refocus the peace talks from an approach that is centred on dialogue with rebels to one of authentic dialogue with the communities. The context of our engagement with all armed groups will subscribe to the United Nations-recognized principle of disarmament  demobilization and reintegration. We maintain high hopes in interfaith dialogue as a means of building bridges rather than barriers between communities of different cultures and ethnicity. In furtherance of this effort  the Philippines will host the first-ever Special Ministerial Meeting of the Non-Aligned Movement on Interfaith Dialogue and Cooperation for Peace and Development in May next    08-51570 16  year. We will also cooperate with the Alliance of Civilizations.  We are also pleased that the Secretary-General will join us in Manila during the second Global Forum on Migration and Development. Our overseas Filipino workers are true global pioneers. There is no ship abroad that does not have a Filipino crew or a nation that does not have highly skilled Filipino workers. The movement of people from one country to another will surely increase as globalization continues to erase borders. This fact should be recognized as having implications for the growth and development of both sending and receiving countries.  In many troubled places of our world  the United Nations is the last great hope for peace and security. For this reason  the Philippines contributes one of the largest police contingents to United Nations peacekeeping operations.  Mr. President  your leadership is more vital than ever. The Philippines will fully support you as you lead our General Assembly for the coming year.  In conclusion  there are hundreds of millions of good people across this globe who are struggling as never before. We must hear their cry for help. It is within the collective power of the leaders at this United Nations General Assembly to fulfil the universal dream of better education  better health  food on the table and a dignified life. "
"138",5611,"PLW",63,2008,"On behalf of President Tommy E. Remengesau  Jr.  and the people of Palau  I offer my congratulations to the President on his election. I assure him and all Member States that the United Nations will have my Government’s full cooperation and support in the coming year.  Our existential challenge is climate change. To quote the text prepared for the President’s address at the opening of this session  we “cannot accept  under any circumstance  proposals for mandatory emissions reduction targets that take for granted sacrificing the homelands of entire peoples”. We must reach an agreement on a set of quantified emission reduction targets for the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol. These targets must reflect the urgency of the circumstances.   The post-2012 regime must address mitigating the impacts of climate change on small island developing States. As the text of the President’s opening address states  Member States “must be guided by a single consideration: saving those small island States that today live in danger of disappearing entirely as nations”. Never before in all history has the disappearance of whole nations been such a real possibility. As we noted in Niue  Palau and the members of the Pacific Islands Forum are deeply concerned about the growing threat that climate change poses not only to our sustainable development  but in fact to our future survival. This is a security matter that has gone unaddressed.    08-51845 30   It is for this reason that the Pacific Small Island Developing States submitted a draft resolution at the sixty-second session of the General Assembly requesting that the Security Council honour the Charter of the United Nations and actively continue its consideration of the security implications of climate change. We were gratified by the positive response from the international community and thank our many co-sponsors for their support. We will reintroduce our resolution in the sixty-third session and look forward to Assembly action this fall.  In the meantime  we cannot wait. While Palau contributes little to greenhouse gas emissions  we are taking significant steps to reduce our reliance on fossil fuel  despite the detrimental economic consequences to us. The number of projects on energy efficiency and renewable energy has been increased  and we thank our donor partners for their support. We appreciate the support of Italy and Austria in supporting development cooperation with respect to energy for sustainable development. We also thank the European Union for their ongoing assistance in the area of renewable energy.  We sincerely hope that Taiwan will be able to participate in the specialized agencies of the United Nations. The Republic of China’s meaningful participation in those agencies  such as the World Health Organization and the International Civil Aviation Organization  would help promote peace and cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region  enhance important dialogue and help all peoples.  The oceans that surround Palau are the backbone of our nation’s existence and are integral to our continued viability as an independent nation. At the sixty-first session we banded together to protect vulnerable marine ecosystems from deep sea bottom trawling  a destructive fishing practice responsible for 95 per cent of the worldwide damage to seamounts. We congratulate the South Pacific Regional Fisheries Management Organisation for adopting interim measures that are a substantial step towards eliminating bottom trawling. We urge all other regional fisheries management organizations and flag States to follow this example  and we remind everyone that the deadline to take action  31 December 2008  is fast approaching.  Palau has been active on the issue of bottom trawling because of its effects on ocean ecosystems. The North Pacific is home to some of the world’s best remaining fisheries. Their diversity is a key reason for the Micronesia Challenge  whereby the countries and territories of Micronesia joined together to conserve 30 per cent of near-shore marine resources and 20 per cent of land resources by the year 2020.   This project is the first of its kind in the world. It covers 6.7 million square miles of ocean and helps to protect 10 per cent of the world’s coral reefs  including more than 60 threatened species. We thank the General Assembly for its recognition of this programme at its sixty-second session  in resolution 62/215 on oceans and law of the sea and thank our development partners  including Turkey  the Global Environment Fund  the Nature Conservancy and Conservation International for their support.  Since Palau joined the United Nations in 1994  we have highlighted our concern that the Organization has no presence in our country. We were pleased therefore when the United Nations Development Programme  the United Nations Population Fund and the United Nations Children’s Fund announced that eight new joint offices would open in Pacific island countries  including Palau. We welcome that historic accomplishment and await the opening ceremony.  Palau is an active participant in the efforts of the international community to combat terrorism and has made every effort to improve its anti-terrorism capacity. We have met with the Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate to advance our requests for assistance  particularly in the area of combating money-laundering and terrorism financing. Unfortunately  the efforts of the Directorate have been insufficient. Our experience has been that the capacity-building efforts of the United Nations have focused on helping countries draft and adopt legislation. That is an excellent first step  but an insufficient one  as the best-designed legislation is meaningless without enforcement.   We hope that  during the sixty-third session of the General Assembly  the United Nations will take the next step and help smaller countries that have the drive but not the means to operationalize the laws and regulations they have in place to fight terrorism. We urge the establishment of a voluntary trust fund that would allow small States to develop effective counter-terrorism initiatives. We thank the United States and   31 08-51845  Australia for the counter-terrorism assistance they have given us.  Urgent attention should be paid to Security Council reform. Without it  there can be no genuine United Nations reform. Japan has demonstrated its concern for and commitment to Palau and all its Pacific neighbours  and should be a permanent member of the Council. Likewise  India  the world’s largest democracy  is a developing nation with a deep sense of involvement in Palau and the rest of the Pacific. We have supported and continue to support the principles of the draft resolution proposed by the Group of Four countries.  We have worked very hard to change the dates for submission to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf. The new submission regime will allow developing countries to preserve our claims to the resources contained in our extended continental shelf. Though that extension of time for submission is welcome  it is only half the battle. We still need the resources and the technical expertise necessary to make a full submission  and we request the assistance of the international community in helping us to achieve that goal.  Palau was the last country to emerge from the United Nations trusteeship system. The United Nations helped to return our sovereignty after four colonial administrations. We are thus particularly proud to advance the objectives of this unique institution and look forward to working together to achieve them during this session of the General Assembly. In closing  let me thank the Assembly in my country’s native language: Kom Kmal Mesulang."
"139",5652,"PNG",63,2008,"On behalf of my people and the Government of Papua New Guinea  I bring the General Assembly warm greetings and pledge our support to you  Mr. President  as you guide us in our work. We also wish to thank Mr. Kerim  your predecessor  for his strong advocacy during his tenure as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session  especially in the area of climate change. We also support Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and the United Nations in general  especially its agencies  in the work they do to enhance our development aspirations in Papua New Guinea. As we have always done  my Government continues to support the United Nations.   The United Nations currently provides the world forum for Member States to address the many global issues we face together. United Nations reforms need to be carried out in all the relevant areas of the system. We need to address the international gender architecture to make it more robust  responsive and effective. It has to be part of the core reform process to cater for women  youth and children. We must also be vigilant against terrorism and threats to international peace and security. The One UN system needs to be translated more meaningfully in order to effectively enhance each Member State’s development priorities.  We support the call for the reform of the Security Council in both the permanent and non-permanent  A/63/PV.13 3 08-53122  categories of membership. A number of emerging developing countries need to be accorded permanent status on the Council to better reflect today’s circumstances. We therefore welcome the recent consensus to initiate the intergovernmental negotiating process to properly address the long-standing but critical issue of United Nations reform.  We live in a world that provides us many opportunities  as well as formidable development challenges. The challenges include addressing the destructive effects of the illicit use of small arms and light weapons and the need to address globalization and food and energy security  which lead into the wider issue of human security.  Additionally  the adverse impacts of climate change and global warming continue to threaten the existence of many small island States  especially due to rising sea levels. For many small island States  sea level rise and the adverse impacts of climate change are security issues threatening their very survival. We therefore call upon the international community to act urgently in order to ensure the security and welfare of small island developing States.  As a thriving democracy in the Pacific  Papua New Guinea desires to see our friends and neighbours in the Pacific and beyond enjoy freedom and prosperity. In that regard  and consistent with the decision of the leaders of the Pacific Islands Forum  Papua New Guinea strongly encourages Fiji to restore parliamentary democracy by preparing for elections and holding them in 2009. However  Fiji must be supported throughout  and not isolated in its efforts to address its specific national circumstances.   On other regional issues  Papua New Guinea commends the work done so far on the Pacific Plan for Strengthening Regional Cooperation and Integration  which we believe may catalyse our region’s development. It is Papua New Guinea’s strong view that Member States from the Pacific region should be categorized separately by the United Nations in terms of aggregated data and in the area of social and economic classification. While Papua New Guinea is ready  we can support Vanuatu’s call for an extension to the May 2009 deadline for submissions on an extended continental shelf.  The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) provide us with one of the greatest opportunities to leverage our development process. For that reason  we commend the Secretary-General for convening the high-level meeting on the MDGs during the present session of the General Assembly. However  for the MDGs to be effectively implemented  they must be addressed consistent with national circumstances and with host-country leadership. Further  for the MDGs to be effective over the long term  developing countries must take ownership of the Goals.  At the midway point of MDG implementation  for Papua New Guinea  we believe there is cause for cautious optimism. Papua New Guinea celebrated 33 years of unbroken constitutional democracy on 16 September this year. Due to the political stability achieved by my Government  we can now afford to plan long-term for our own development. We have had steady economic growth in the last five years  due to prudent economic management that has resulted in five successive budget surpluses.  Achieving the Millennium Development Goals remains an integral development priority for my Government. We have set ourselves 15 national targets and 67 indicators  which have been integrated into our medium-term development strategy and sectoral plans.  For example  Papua New Guinea recognizes that education is a prerequisite for the betterment of our people’s lives. That is entrenched in our constitution and prioritized under a 10-year national education plan. The current one-laptop-per-child pilot project will make learning accessible  enjoyable and fruitful for our children  while bridging the digital divide. We are looking to expand the project nationwide during the Africa Caribbean Pacific-European Union Joint Parliamentary Assembly  to be held in Papua New Guinea in November. In partnership with UNICEF  we have also introduced proactive programmes aimed at accelerating the girl-child’s access to education.  In the area of health  there remain major challenges  such as maternal mortality and HIV/AIDS  which the Government is now addressing through the 10-year national health plan. We have also recorded some positive results in other major health indicators  including a decrease in malaria incidence and in malaria-related deaths  and the stabilization and decline of infant and child mortality.  Ultimately  reducing poverty  expanding access to education and health and empowering women through economic and social participation are what we in my Government are addressing. A/63/PV.13   08-53122 4   Millennium Development Goal 8 makes reference to partnerships. We strongly believe that Goal is critical to the achievement of the other seven. We believe  however  that all partnerships must be underpinned by mutual respect among the partners. For that reason  let me highlight some key partnerships. Our partnerships with Australia  New Zealand  the European Union  Japan  China  Italy  Austria and many non-governmental organizations continue to contribute strongly to Papua New Guinea’s development. We also partner with the Coral Triangle Initiative on coral reefs  fisheries and food security  and the Forest-11 Group  launched last year by His Excellency the President of Indonesia. Another important partnership is with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation  facilitated by the Clinton Foundation  in the area of HIV/AIDS and the provision of antiretrovirals.  To succeed  we must significantly scale up our partnerships. Often  we all tend to wallow in the negative — environmental degradation  catastrophic climate change  crippling poverty  ineffective governance — rather than leveraging the positive. My Government’s vision is to transform those societal challenges into a framework for environmentally and socially sustainable economic growth. It is time to cast off policy chains of the past and create a new paradigm for the future.  Let me be specific. First  we cannot account for the environment as an externality. Our natural environment and its services are not free to society. Once we lose those services  often irreversibly  the costs can be significant.  Secondly  we must create a broad framework for ecosystem service markets. Carbon sequestration must only be the first step  followed by valuations for biodiversity  water purification  rainfall generation  crop pollination and food security.   Thirdly  we must now view our natural environment as an engine for wealth creation. Those valuable ecosystem services must be transformed into lasting wealth that supports the rural communities that have traditionally cared for those assets.  Let me use the issue of reducing deforestation and forest degradation — an issue that our Prime Minister  Grand Chief Sir Michael Somare  has championed internationally — as an example. Deforestation is a complex subject  but  put simply  it is driven by the fact that the world values forests more dead than alive. Traditional economic theory  which considers ecosystem services a common good and thus free to all  is primarily responsible for the massive loss of the world’s forests.  With those ecosystem services valued at zero  rural communities that depend on and care for forests must make a living in other ways. Keeping the land forested means sacrificing the opportunities to be gained by converting it to other uses  such as producing commodities such as timber  palm oil  coffee and cocoa. The international commodity markets  in fact  have hardly changed from colonial times.  In many ways  those two economic relics are increasingly perverse and nonsensical. The environment is devastated  rural communities stay poor and the rich shift the blame. They cite lack of governance and corruption  but those are not drivers of deforestation  but symptoms of obsolete market constructs.  Therefore  global leaders must redraft economic theory and reinvent global markets for a sustainable future. For example  the latest estimate is that approximately $20 billion a year will be needed to halve carbon emissions resulting from deforestation. However  that would be a wise investment  even for that one ecosystem service alone. Forests sequester some 3.3 billion tons of carbon dioxide annually. So  with today’s price of more than $30 per ton of carbon dioxide  rural communities are effectively subsidizing the carbon emissions of the rich to the tune of approximately $100 billion per year — more than total annual official development assistance.   Norway has provided great leadership towards that necessary paradigm shift. First  Norway has stood up against global climate change and has targeted the achievement of carbon neutrality by 2030. Norway has also dedicated $2.8 billion to offset emissions reductions resulting from deforestation in developing countries  through the valuation of forest ecosystem services.  Faced by the ravages of climate change on a small island developing State  our Prime Minister  Sir Michael Somare  has charted out his own bold goals: reducing Papua New Guinea’s emissions by 50 per cent before 2025 and achieving carbon neutrality before 2050. Sharing a similar vision  the partnership of leadership between Papua New Guinea and Norway may significantly address several of the greatest  A/63/PV.13 5 08-53122  challenges of our time: effectively valuing global environmental services  contributing to the mitigation of climate change  conserving global biodiversity and financing the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals in rural areas.  Finally  our global economy values companies in the billions simply for advertising trinkets on the Internet. Some countries make billions by selling fossil fuels that pollute our atmosphere  others by producing low-cost consumer products that humanity does not require. In fact  Google is worth $150 billion  while the world’s last great tropical forests left standing are worth nothing. How can that be right?   Together  we must reconstruct our value frameworks. New environmental markets must support tropical countries striving to achieve sustainable development  by generating billions from rainforest ecosystem services that humanity has so far been exploiting for free.  Several communities in my country have voted to cancel their logging concessions  telling me that the forests and rivers have provided all they needed for thousands of years. In some ways  however  they now feel trapped. The old ways allowed them to survive but did not prepare their children for an increasingly complex future. They now struggle with schools that cannot afford the best teachers and with health centres that provide only basic medicines. Yet those communities still remember how to live sustainably — a skill that many others have forgotten in the rush to get ahead.  But there is hope. Bold leadership is required on both sides of the economic divide to transform the way in which we value our environment and create wealth for rural populations. As leaders  we must understand that  while we may have inherited the Earth from our forefathers  we have in fact borrowed it from our grandchildren and our future generations. Indeed  by learning to save our environment  perhaps we can once again learn how to save ourselves and guarantee a better world for our future generations.  "
"140",5698,"POL",63,2008,"Let me start by expressing my respect and gratitude to the President of the General Assembly at its previous session  Mr. Srgjan Kerim  whose active involvement and initiatives have contributed to a broader Assembly agenda and facilitated its work. I wish to extend my congratulations to his successor  Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann. I congratulate you  Sir  on your appointment and wish you fruitful work.  The past year has seen many new challenges and problems with which the international community has to deal. In our attempts to respond to these problems and to search for the best solutions we have recognized yet again that different crises cannot be successfully overcome without referring to such universal values as democracy  freedom and solidarity.  One of the biggest global challenges at present is the food crisis and its consequences. The decision to make that issue the central theme of this year’s General Assembly session testifies to the special role of the United Nations as a forum for debate focused on major global challenges. Poland appreciates the initiative to juxtapose the debate on the food crisis with discussions about the need to democratize the United Nations  as it is only a democratic and effective United Nations that can face up to the global challenges of eliminating hunger and poverty and ensuring the sustainable development of the poorest nations. That is why we remain certain that the United Nations reform process should continue.   One of the fundamentals of the democratic governance of the United Nations is the rule “one State  one vote”. Each State should be given the opportunity to decide in which direction the United Nations will head  and the General Assembly remains the most important forum for such democratic debate. In this context  it is especially important to streamline the decision-making mechanism.   We are in favour of accelerating the pace of work on Security Council reform. The number of non-permanent members of the Council should be increased so as to truly reflect today’s world. Let us remember that some of the rules in that regard were laid down in a world that was fundamentally different from today’s.   “Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family  including food  clothing  housing and medical care and necessary social services”: that principle is enshrined in article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  whose sixtieth anniversary we celebrate this year. As an international community  we bear responsibility for their fulfilment.   Fighting against hunger and poverty is among the eight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). It has been almost eight years since the international community set them. Despite numerous declarations and commitments we are still short of achieving the Goals. It will be impossible to overcome the current crisis or carry out our development policies unless —   31 08-51839  and I stress this — every country shoulders its individual responsibility  takes concrete steps and assesses the progress made so far. We should make joint efforts to promote a global development programme with the MDGs as its basis.   It was in that vein that Poland joined British Prime Minister Gordon Brown in endorsing the call to action on the MDGs. We hope that that statement  which reflects a broad understanding among countries  business representatives  non-governmental organizations and faith groups will contribute to the full attainment of the Millennium Development Goals. We believe that the high-level meeting on the Millennium Development Goals taking place on 25 September will result in concrete commitments that will be implemented in a timely manner: timeliness is of special importance.  As we analyse the causes of the food crisis and try to find effective prescriptions for combating poverty and hunger  we take note of the immense negative impact of climate change on these phenomena. Although the consequences of climate change will be felt globally  it is the poorest who will bear the brunt and who will be hurt the most severely. It goes without saying that  without solidarity  responsibility and enhanced mutual cooperation  developing countries will not be able to fulfil their commitments regarding reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and will fail to successfully adapt to climate change. This calls for a certain change of philosophy in our approach  and for much greater effort on the part of the North in favour of the South. What I am saying now is mere short hand: the rich should become much more committed to helping the poor. The United Nations is  if not the sole organization  then definitely the principal organization that can implement these objectives.  Poland wants to be an active partner in the international community’s activities to that end. With this in mind  we will be hosting in Poznan in December this year the fourteenth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the fourth Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol. One of the key challenges facing this year’s Conference is to work out solutions and mechanisms that will support and bring about true systemic change in developing countries. It is especially vital to ensure the funding of investments that will help to modernize the economies of those countries and help them reduce carbon dioxide emissions and adapt to climate change. I reiterate that there is no possibility of implementing these objectives without a major change in thinking  especially by the countries that now have the most resources. We hope that this year’s Poznan Conference will lay strong foundations for reaching a new agreement in Copenhagen in December next year.   As holder of the presidency of the fourteenth session of the Conference of Parties  Poland will strive to bring the positions of major countries as close as possible so as to ensure maximum progress during the Poznan Conference. We anticipate cooperation and support from our international partners and friends. We greatly appreciate the Secretary-General’s deep commitment to the implementation of these objectives.  Introducing new  more climate-friendly technologies should be coupled with enhanced energy security and diversification of energy sources. As we do not yet have mechanisms to guarantee solidarity on the energy crisis among all States members of the European Union — I refer to the European Union but this is also applicable to all other States of the world — the issue of energy security becomes our priority.  Poland is following developments in Georgia with concern. We believe that engaging in dialogue and acting in a spirit of solidarity and consistency in implementing energy policy should become a priority for all European States  especially European Union States. It is only in that way that Europe can be assured of energy security  especially at a time of the complete unpredictability of actions of the current main suppliers of energy to Europe.  Poland’s concern arises from the abuse by some States  especially one very powerful State  of energy as a tool to achieve political goals in relations with neighbours and with all the other nations that benefit from the supply of energy by that State.  Thus it is of fundamental importance to diversify the sources of supply  to introduce transparent rules regulating the energy trade and to extend transport infrastructure  especially by developing alternative routes and energy sources for the European Union  mainly from the Caspian Sea  Central Asia and the Middle East. This could significantly accelerate the development of the States of those areas and enhance their potential as part of global solidarity.    08-51839 32   I have referred to Georgia in the context of energy security. But the situation in that country is far more serious. Several weeks ago we witnessed an illegal military aggression and the division of the country. That was an aggression against an independent State. Fundamental principles of international law  such as the inviolability of borders and respect for territorial integrity  were breached.  Without respect for those principles  the world will be a hotbed of not one but hundreds of conflicts. We cannot allow the relativization of international law. We cannot accept that international law is applicable to the weak but not binding on the strong. If we do  international law will have no positive impact  especially as concerns the principle of territorial integrity. We must not allow the undermining of a principle on the basis of which the United Nations was established 63 years ago in the aftermath of the Second World War as a consequence of the bankruptcy of the League of Nations. That founding principle of the United Nations is the principle of law and of opposition to the unlawful use of force.  Not all members come from countries neighbouring Georgia or from countries in or near Europe  but the problem of Georgia is a problem for us all  for every country that is grappling with issues relating to territorial integrity or to stronger neighbours abusing their advantages. The international order should be based on strict compliance with the United Nations Charter by all subjects of international law — first and foremost  by all States. It should be based on common responsibility for the fate of countries incapable of ensuring their own security alone.   Those were the motives that guided my response to the Georgian conflict and the actions of the Presidents of Estonia  Latvia  Lithuania and Ukraine. The complete implementation of the peace plan  which should also cover the issue of the territorial integrity of Georgia  is a prerequisite for the further discussions about the Caucasus to be held in Geneva in October and a prerequisite for the future of relations between the European Union — of which Poland is the twenty-sixth member — and Russia. Those relations can be correct and mutual only if both sides respect international law in their relations both with each other and with third parties.  One expression of Poland’s involvement in international security is its participation in a counter-terrorism coalition in many volatile regions of the world. Today  more than 3 500 Polish troops and police officers are taking part in global peacekeeping and stabilization forces — from Africa to the Balkans  through the Middle East and Asia.   Iraq was one such place. Through the five years of its presence in Iraq  Poland has made efforts to help its Iraqi friends and allies to ensure strengthened external and internal security. Its mission  the main stage of which comes to an end this year  has clearly been a success. Iraq today is definitely safer and more stable than a few years ago  despite the doubts expressed in some circles.   What remains a challenge  however  is the situation in Afghanistan. We deeply believe that the mission in Afghanistan  in which Poland is also taking an active part  is bound to end in success  not only a military success in the fight against terrorism but also the success of the Afghan nation in improving its day-to-day existence. Military action must also be accompanied by measures to stabilize the Afghan economy  improve the internal security situation and enable Afghanistan to grow more quickly. I should like to believe that this mission will end successfully.  The continuing lack of stability in the Middle East is a source of concern for almost — the “almost” is regrettable — every country in the world  including Poland. The lengthy process of building an independent Palestinian State should be completed as soon as possible  for the sake of Palestinians and Israelis alike  both nations being Poland’s friends. We wish the Palestinian people every success in their struggle for an independent State. To Israel  with which we have important historic ties  because many of its citizens come from Poland  we wish successes and peace  a peace much needed by Israel.   I note with pleasure that our hopes are being raised by the situation in Lebanon. Poland believes that the elections and the new President will bring the stability and peace for which the Lebanese people have been waiting for 35 years — and even before that the situation was often difficult. We wish the new Lebanese authorities and the nation of Lebanon every success. We will be involved in this part of the world in a spirit of international solidarity and because of our historic ties with the region.   The issues I have mentioned cannot be resolved by a single State or a single group of States. Today we   33 08-51839  see clearly that we need joint action by all countries: rich and poor  from both the east and the west. However  in today’s world  where the division into east and west is no longer as important as it was in the past  what we need above all is solidarity between north and south; we must give help to those in need.   We need to promote democracy  of course adapting it to the cultural conditions and traditions of a given State  because  regardless of its flaws  there has never in our history been a system more friendly to mankind. We should act jointly and in a spirit of solidarity through effectively operating international structures such as the United Nations and its agencies  which have global reach and an unchallenged position. The Secretary-General rightly says that there should be deeper coordination between the work of the agencies  irrespective of the great successes which the bodies affiliated to the United Nations have scored over recent decades.  What is most important  however  is to ensure universal respect for international law  human rights and fundamental freedoms.   I hope that when we meet next year during the sixty-fourth session the world will be slightly safer and a little closer to the principles that I have had the honour to refer to in this address."
"141",5724,"PRK",63,2008,"At the outset  on behalf of the delegation of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea  allow me to congratulate you  Sir  on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session. I also wish to express confidence that  under your able stewardship  the current session will be a success.   It is a centuries-long aspiration of mankind to live in a peaceful and prosperous world  free from war and domination. Nearly 10 years have passed since the General Assembly adopted the Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2)  reflecting that common desire. Nevertheless  a vicious circle of aggression and intervention  conflict and terrorism still persists within international relations  and  consequently  global peace and security continue to face serious new challenges.  The military alliances in place throughout the cold war era are being further intensified  and arms races in new forms are taking place in the Asia-Pacific  European and other regions. Attempts to justify violations of the sovereignty of developing countries under the pretext of human rights  non-proliferation and the war on terror go ever-more undisguised. Disparities in wealth and imbalances in the level of development between the North and the South have become further deepened  foreshadowing gloomy prospects for the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals in developing countries. The ever-worsening energy  food and financial crises of recent days are seriously affecting the already vulnerable economies of developing countries.  Today’s realities require all Member States to pool their efforts for the building of a just  peaceful and prosperous world as a matter of priority  as they pledged in the Millennium Declaration.  The building of a new world  free and peaceful  without domination  subjugation  aggression or war is a common aspiration of the world’s peoples and is now the shared responsibility of humankind. Ongoing efforts to reform the United Nations and enhance its role should be directed towards that end. It is also imperative to hold in check the attempts of some individual countries to address critical international issues related to world peace and security solely with a view to their own interests. For that purpose  there is a need to decisively enhance the authority of the General Assembly  in which all Member States exercise their equal rights.  Aggression and interference in the internal affairs of sovereign States and acts committed under the cover of human rights protection should be completely rejected. Today  the worst peace-breaker and human rights violator in the world is none other than the United States  as evidenced by its armed invasion of sovereign countries and its unhesitating massacre of innocent civilians.  Human rights are sovereign and independent rights. We urge Member States to remain vigilant in the face of the constant clamouring by the United States and other Western countries on the subject of human rights protection and not to accept the politicization of  or selectivity and double standards in human rights.  The main reason that the question of relations between the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and Japan has been unresolved for over half a century lies in Japan’s failure to liquidate its past  which is stained with large-scale crimes. Japan is the only war criminal State that whitewashes the history of aggression and massacre of millions of innocent people in Korea and other Asian countries and today attempts to grab the sacred Tok Islet of Korea. Such a country    08-53129 38  should never be permitted to become a permanent member of the Security Council.  No one aspires to peace more than the Korean people  who suffered under Japanese military occupation for almost half a century and since have been in confrontation with the United States for over 60 years. Even now  a series of reckless military manoeuvres destabilizing the region  including through the strengthening of strategic military alliances  massive shipments of state-of-the-art war equipment and annual large-scale military exercises  are being conducted in and around the Korean peninsula.  The Ulji Freedom Guardian joint military exercise  staged by the United States and the Republic of Korea this past August  under the pretext of what they called “Preparation for an emergency on the Korean peninsula”  was nothing more than a war drill  for all intents and purposes mounting a pre-emptive nuclear strike on the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.  Double-faced approaches  such as talking about dialogue and resorting to war exercises against a dialogue partner behind the scenes  are a clear indication of the persistently hostile policy of the United States against the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and the confrontational policy of the present South Korean regime.  In the face of such military threats and danger of war  the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea has been strengthening in every possible way its self-defence capability in order to safeguard its national sovereignty and peace. That choice and right of ours is just and legitimate and cannot be subject to criticism and blame by others. If the powerful deterrent to war secured by the Songun policy of the respected General Kim Jong Il had not existed  the Korean peninsula would have already suffered catastrophes several times over  which would certainly have led to the complete disruption of regional peace and stability as a whole.  The denuclearization of the Korean peninsula is the lifetime instruction of President Kim Il Sung  the great leader of our people  and the Government of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea remains consistent in its position of resolving the nuclear issue peacefully through dialogue and negotiations. The adoption of the North-South Joint Declaration on the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula in 1992 and of the Agreed Framework between the United States of America and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea in 1994 are a demonstration of the firm political will of our Government to denuclearize the Korean peninsula.  Thanks to our sincere endeavours  several rounds of the Six-Party Talks have been held to date  enabling the adoption of the Joint Statement of 19 September 2005  followed by the agreements on and implementation of phased actions aimed at resolving the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula.   The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea honoured its commitments to the agreements of the Six-Party Talks in good faith. Nuclear facilities were disabled at the final stage  a nuclear declaration was submitted and those measures envisaged for the destruction phase were even implemented in advance.   That notwithstanding  the United States has laid an artificial obstacle to implementing the 3 October agreement by refusing to implement its obligations and put forward such an unjust demand as verification of an international standard never agreed on among the six parties or between the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and the United States.   The international standard asserted by the United States is nothing but the special inspection that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) called for in the 1990s to infringe upon the sovereignty of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea  causing it ultimately to pull out of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.  The United States has now put on hold the implementation of the procedure for de-listing the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea as a State sponsor of terrorism under the pretext of verification  even after having officially declared that the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is not a State sponsor of terrorism. That is little short of admitting that the list is not actually related to terrorism.   As far as verification is concerned  it is a commitment to be fulfilled by the six parties during the final phase of the denuclearization of the entire Korean peninsula  in accordance with the 19 September Joint Statement. The United States insistence on unilateral inspection of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is a brigand-like demand to unilaterally disarm the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea  the other warring party  by discarding its commitment to the   39 08-53129  denuclearization of the entire Korean peninsula  the core of which is the removal of the United States nuclear threat  in accordance with the 19 September Joint Statement.  Now that the United States has broken the agreement  the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is inevitably taking relevant countermeasures based on the principle of action for action. If the six parties are not true to their word in carrying out their respective obligations because of their great lack of trust in one another  no progress will be made at all. That is a lesson drawn from the process of previous Six-Party Talks. The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea will continue to make every sincere effort to achieve the denuclearization of the entire Korean peninsula  but we will not be indifferent to an attempt to offend our dignity and self-respect and to violate our sovereignty.  As members are well aware  inter-Korean relations have been worsening ever since the installation of the new regime in South Korea  which rejects the North-South joint declaration of 15 June 2000 and the declaration of 4 October 2007. Resolutions were adopted by consensus at previous General Assembly sessions supporting the historic North-South summits held in Pyongyang in 2000 and 2007 and the 15 June 2000 joint declaration and the 4 October 2007 declaration resulting from them. As stipulated in those resolutions  the 15 June joint declaration and programme of action and the 4 October declaration constitute major milestones that could shorten the process of improving inter-Korean relations and achieving independent national reunification in the new century  as well as a grand programme for Korean reunification that clearly reflects the demands of the times and the aspirations of the nation.  Those declarations enjoy the unanimous support not only of the entire Korean people  but also of the international community as a whole  as they are most comprehensive and realistic in their content and include all previous inter-Korean agreements  including the joint statement of 4 July 1972  which clarifies the three principles of independence  peaceful reunification and great national unity.  It is intolerable that the declarations agreed upon and adopted at the highest level in the North and the South and supported unanimously by the international community are now being disregarded simply because of the changed regime in South Korea. The Government of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea will continue to seek national reconciliation and unity by fully implementing the 15 June joint declaration and the 4 October declaration  launching a new era of independent reunification  peace and prosperity and doing its utmost to ensure durable peace and stability on the Korean peninsula.

"142",5769,"PRT",63,2008,"Mr. President  I wish you all success for your tenure in office.   Guaranteeing international peace and security as well as the sustainable development of our peoples is our shared responsibility. The way we carry it out will determine our common destiny. The centrality of the United Nations has never been so clear. The United Nations will be what we  as sovereign and equal Member States  want it to be.  We live in a time of historic acceleration  a time of great opportunities but also of challenges on a global scale. Global challenges imply a collective responsibility. The United Nations is the forum that best embodies that collective responsibility. That is also why I strongly support the statement made by the President of the French Republic  current President of the Council of the European Union.  In a globalized and interdependent world  only strong multilateral institutions can promote the fundamental values of peace  democracy  human rights and sustainable development. Portugal is committed to supporting effective multilateralism based on a cohesive and efficient United Nations.  Our words cannot be empty rhetoric. Therefore we must be consistent and put into practice the values and principles we defend. Our actions must be based on very clear assumptions. First  we must make every effort to ensure that the United Nations has the means necessary to fulfil its mission  and we must contribute to the achievement of the mandates with which we entrust it.  Secondly  we must ensure broader representation in the United Nations bodies and make their actions more transparent. Is it reasonable to continue having a Security Council without reforming its working methods  when countries such as Brazil and India have no permanent seat and when Africa is not permanently represented? We surely do not think so and are open to the possibility of broader solutions.    11 08-51749   Thirdly  we must guarantee the fulfilment of the declarations on human rights approved by all of us. The Organization must bear in mind that the ultimate beneficiaries of its actions are not States as such  but the citizens and peoples that compose them.  Portugal has been committed to this common effort — first  by participating in peacekeeping operations. I would like to commend the many thousands of Portuguese who have participated in over 20 missions led by the United Nations and those who currently are taking part in missions in Afghanistan  the Central African Republic  Chad  Kosovo  Lebanon and Timor-Leste.  This year we celebrate the sixtieth anniversary of United Nations peacekeeping operations  and I would like to pay tribute to all of the Blue Helmets. In particular I pay tribute to the memory of all of those  including Portuguese nationals  who have made the ultimate sacrifice for the ideals of the United Nations Charter.  Africa must remain a priority. That belief led us  together with our African partners  to hold the Cairo and Lisbon summits between the European Union (EU) and Africa  which began to further the dialogue between the two continents. The shared principles  the commitments undertaken and the EU-Africa Joint Strategy illustrate a renewed partnership based on cooperation in areas such as peace and security  development  good governance and human rights  trade and regional integration. Peace  sustainable development  access to education and health care and the integration of African economies in the international markets are essential objectives in building a more just  peaceful and balanced international order. Accordingly  we must support the efforts of the African nations to achieve those objectives.  In that context  I would like to congratulate the Angolan people for the civic-minded manner in which they conducted their recent electoral process. The legislative elections had a profound bearing on the consolidation of democracy in Angola  with important regional political repercussions.  I also welcome the political agreement in Zimbabwe  which we hope will mark a new period of national reconciliation as well as political and economic development.  I wish also to congratulate Guinea-Bissau on the anniversary of its independence. Guinea-Bissau is one of the States Members of the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries (CPLP)  from which it has received strong political support. The CPLP has undertaken increasing responsibilities as an operational partner of the regional organizations to which its member States belong  such as the European Union and the African Union  and of global organizations such as the United Nations.  The recent Lisbon summit of the CPLP  at which Portugal took over the presidency of the Community  confirmed its members’ determination to promote peace  democracy  human rights and development. It also led to the definition of a common strategy of international assertiveness based on our shared asset: the Portuguese language — the fifth most spoken language in the world  connecting nations and peoples in five continents. This assertiveness should lead to the increased use of Portuguese as an official or working language of international organizations.  Recently  Portugal also assumed the presidency of the Community of Democracies. Very soon  we will be presiding over the Ibero-American Summit — a genuine reference point for political cooperation based on shared cultures and values. We are honoured by those mandates  which we intend to exercise with determination and confidence.  Portugal believes that the natural vocation of the Alliance of Civilizations to bring together peoples  cultures and religions will be instrumental in establishing a world where dialogue prevails over conflict and where tolerance  respect for cultural diversity and individual identity  and mutual understanding overcome built-up tensions. We therefore resolutely support the Implementation Plan of the High Representative of the Secretary-General.  Seven years have passed since New York suffered one of the most infamous acts the world has witnessed in our time. Although much has been done since then  terrorism continues to be a threat. The implementation of the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy is fundamental to success in combating that common enemy. In that regard  it is crucial to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms  the promotion of which contributes to preventing terrorism.  Hunger and extreme poverty are other  more insidious but equally destructive common enemies.    08-51749 12  Much has also been said in that connection  and some measures have been taken. However  much more is required. We reiterate our unwavering support for the Millennium Development Goals. Portugal  which is contributing to the limit of its capabilities  is directing most of its development aid to Africa  where the levels of poverty are most striking.   We are pleased to note the establishment of the High-level Task Force on the Global Food Crisis. Combating hunger and poverty requires a strengthened global partnership in which the United Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions have a central role to play.   Ensuring sustainable development requires that we confront the challenges posed by climate change together. Failure to act now will result in an irreversible legacy for future generations  as shown by the last progress report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. In that common effort  we must support those who are most vulnerable to the effects of climate change  such as small island developing States and least developed countries.   Oceans  seas  islands and coastal areas  which are vital for human life and economic prosperity  deserve our utmost attention. It is therefore important that we join efforts to ensure that negotiations are completed by December next year on a global and transparent agreement on a post-2012 climate regime.  Economic development is not an end in itself; it is a means towards the progress of humankind and the affirmation of human rights. Portugal has been the driving force behind the draft optional protocol to the International Covenant on Economic  Social and Cultural Rights  which the Assembly will be called upon to adopt. It is our opinion that the draft protocol represents a landmark in the promotion of democracy that will enable us to properly celebrate the sixtieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Let us always bear in mind that the dignity of human beings is not negotiable.  I would now like to refer to the humanitarian situation of refugees. Portugal acknowledges the remarkable work carried out by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. We must continue our collective efforts. In that regard  my country has responded to the need by tripling its refugee quota.  We are the United Nations. Its destiny is in our hands. The success of the Organization is closely linked to its capacity for regeneration and increased democratization  representation and effectiveness. I therefore wish to commend the consensus in the General Assembly as regards the Security Council reform process  which should enable intergovernmental negotiations to begin shortly. Portugal is honoured to be directly associated with that outcome.   In 2000  Portugal submitted its candidacy for a non-permanent seat in the Security Council for the biennium 2011-2012. Our candidacy must be considered in the light of the principles and values of the United Nations that we have long defended and which are enshrined in the Portuguese Constitution. We stand for service to peace and stability  sustainable development and human rights. We also believe in the central role of the Organization in pursuing those goals. We stand for equal representation for those States that constitute the majority in this house because we believe that that is the best way to guarantee a sense of justice  which is essential if decisions are to be accepted by all. "
"143",5815,"PRY",63,2008,"On behalf of the nation of Paraguay  I wish to express to you  Mr. President  my most sincere congratulations on your election to preside over the General Assembly at its sixty-third session. I wish you every success.  This is a place where every year the Powers of the world write history that should transcend mere lofty political prose and be a tool for verse — the poetry of eliminating hunger  embracing equity among nations and building a better world for all. I believe that  one day  these enormous buildings — which were built with the aim of preventing war — will be increasingly dedicated to providing bread  eradicating hunger and malnutrition throughout the world and saving millions of lives from disease and violence of all kinds.  After 61 years of single-party Government and for the first time in my country’s political history  a party has come to power via the ballot — the appropriate means under the democratic code. Paraguay is soaring on the winds of democratic change that are blowing through the region. The new Government that I represent is an unequivocal response to the many needs that have arisen and opportunities that have been lost in recent decades. This year  citizens voted for greater social justice  to halt the   7 08-51749  massive destruction of the environment  and to combat the corruption  shady dealings and favouritism of a weakened and opportunistic State that delayed the implementation of a sustainable and inclusive development strategy for years.  The new administration represents the end of our 19-year transition to democracy and has embarked on reform of the State and the economy. It has encouraged citizens to participate in the political decision-making process. We understand that political and economic stability is not more important than social stability. That is why we are committed to applying social policies to combat extreme poverty. We cannot hope for sustainable development when the market and the State deny opportunities to the weakest  nor is it possible to sustain democracy when the vast majority are excluded from enjoying economic benefits. We therefore believe in economic growth with social equity and in environmental responsibility as the very heart of our public policies.   Paraguay has opened a door of opportunity to the world. Two weeks ago  before we had come to the end of our first month in power  my Government launched a major assault on illicit Government management. The mafias that enjoyed shameful and excessive wealth through their influence on public power are enduring the worst moment of their history in Paraguay. We do not rule out the possibility of stripping the ill-gotten gains from those whom scandalous wealth made millionaires overnight and are now digging in their heels and even hatching specific plots to foment political and economic instability. The political holdovers in Paraguay still cling to a fascistic style of patronage  to which my Government has responded firmly but calmly. We will show zero tolerance for any anti-democratic activity and close our doors to all blackmail and any attempt to revive outdated models of access to power.   The new Government  which came to power on 15 August  has been proactive in a historic show of solidarity with the democratic peoples of Latin America and in its rapid response in defence of democratically elected Governments  such as in the sister Republic of Bolivia  in the context of the Union of South American Nations. We also thank those brotherly countries that stood with us in the face of potential instability and have expressed their concern for and solidarity with the Paraguayan process.   The only way to build economic relations has been through a market mechanism which sold Latin America on the financial speculation of the 1980s that sunk our continent in debt  sidelined the role of the State and widened the gap between rich and poor. That mechanism  which was forced upon us  has proven to be wrong-headed and very costly for our peoples on the social level.  Today  we are seeing a financial crisis in developed economies as a result of immoral speculation that also affects the well-being of peoples. The sole motive behind such speculation is the desire for greater wealth that privatizes benefits and socializes the costs of unregulated market economies.   Paraguay is in favour of strengthening the General Assembly and restoring its mandated attributes and functions under the United Nations Charter. As the most representative body of the Organization  the Assembly must become a true world parliament in which the major issues affecting humankind can be discussed and are not relegated to other bodies whose decision-making process is confined to a small number of countries that often fail to take the opinion of the majority of the membership into account.  Paraguay believes that the problems that have led to climate change call for short- and long-term world responses in line with the most recent scientific advances and applied in a fashion that is compatible with the economic and social development of each country affected. Countries with economies in development suffer in particular from vulnerability and isolation as they attempt to enter the globalized market.   Ironically  it is the poorest — those who are the least responsible for climate change — who suffer most from its consequences. When it comes to major responsibility  we often note the irony of conservation measures imposed on areas of the world that are already suffering from poverty and exclusion. At the same time  we note the sustained indifference and limited capacities for self-criticism in the political realms that manage the fate of the world. That is precisely where the principal industrial and consumption phenomena arise  creating societies that  due to the irresponsibility of their leaders  persist in depleting their own resources  their own lands  their own dreams and their own lives.   Paraguay therefore calls on countries to recognize their shared but differentiated responsibilities. We    08-51749 8  stress the need for all members of the international community to act on their pledges. The same is true in determining political and economic responsibility for the deterioration of the world — the irreplaceable home of humankind.   At the same high level as our concern for the structural and immediate causes of poverty is our concern for the situation of indigenous peoples. Not only are they poor and excluded  but in many regions of the continent they have not reached a level of civic inclusion that permits them to be involved in decision-making processes. In many cases  those who uphold a discourse of inclusion are intolerant when our indigenous brothers take on political leadership roles.   The indigenous nations of Latin America are not the ancient creation of our continent  but the most vital potential for political action  which we must respect  promote and include. If we did not  that would be an intolerable attack against our own civilization. America must wake up in the face of all of that.   We need to account for the old debt  which began to accrue in the filthy bowels of the slave ships and continued to grow with every gesture of disdain towards any indigenous attempt to have their say  their vote  their dreams and their plans for the land that at one time was theirs alone. Recognizing indigenous peoples as participants in the political and participatory processes of the State is still a pending issue  and it is a sad expression of intolerance in many regions.   In Paraguay  we have begun a process of transparency that has no precedents. The media are playing a fundamental role in this process. They were very proactive in combating corruption in Paraguay  and today  because of their questioning of our management  they are working at a high standard to generate ongoing self-criticism. As we guarantee the most unconditional support for enlightened management in journalism  self-expression and the right to access information  we seek to open up better horizons for the communications and education media  which had always been persecuted or dismissed as of no importance in our country.   We must work to build a more just world through social engineering. It is time to go beyond statements that are incapable of showing clear signs of progress in the fight against poverty and exclusion. The world’s forums for debate and reflection cause strain and risk losing credibility if they do not lead to actions that can draw a smile on the faces of unemployed youths who have no future. It is sad to see migrants who wander in an incessant exodus of biblical proportions  or to see women who are relegated to a secondary position by a culture and a civilization unable to recover the original dignity that belongs to them  who give life  affection  creativity and courage to change the world.   We need to highlight food security by ensuring not only space and opportunities for self-managed production  but also its cultural  sovereign and national identity dimensions. We are calling for greater  better and more timely international assistance for agricultural and fishing production in order to ensure increasing food production without destroying the environment and avoiding the current rise in food prices. Those costs end up punishing primarily the most vulnerable groups. On the global scale  we call upon nations that are heading huge agricultural projects to recognize the tribulations of small local producers  who often are crushed by new models that are arrogantly imposed on them.   The question of landlocked developing countries is a fundamental issue in Paraguay’s foreign policy. The disadvantages and asymmetries that that geographic situation has generated and continues to generate can be remedied only through international recognition and the granting of special  differentiated treatment in the country’s insertion into a globalized world.   Paraguay believes that the upcoming midterm review meeting of the Almaty Programme of Action is extremely important. It is an opportunity to consolidate achievements made so far and to ensure greater commitment from international bodies and from more developed countries. Working together in a coordinated matter will help landlocked developing countries overcome their limitations.   In Paraguay  large corporations — the Itaipu with Brazil and the Yasyreta with Argentina — offer abundant and available electric energy. Our Government is committed to prioritizing and using these renewable resources for economic and social development of the country in such a manner as to complement our efforts to create better sources of work  more production and a reduction of poverty. We are operating in a framework of increasingly fluid dialogue with our brotherly countries  with which we share those power stations  so that the benefits can   9 08-51749  repair the social debts deserving our attention and become true factors for economic growth.  Taking into account the upcoming review of the financing for development process  which will take place in Doha at the end of the year  Paraguay calls for the international community to mobilize its external resources to provide decisive support for the development of small economies. That is a priority both for both international financial bodies and  developed economies. We would like the call for just international trade to become a true impetus for development.   Many of our countries have communities in various places in the world. Just like Europeans who in the past century came to America  today many friends and families from our regions seek better prospects in the countries of Europe and in North America. We call upon the humanitarian  brotherly  hospitable sense — the same that our continent showed in the past in sharing its scarce resources — in nations that today take in our migrants  who are dreaming of having a job and the right to a dignified life  far from their countries. The human dimension of that drama calls for a frank dialogue with receiving countries to find a solution to this new drama of globalization.  The Republic of Paraguay believes that  although progress has been made towards the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  we cannot deny the existence of the inequalities that persist in the developed world. Millions of people continue to live in extreme poverty  a situation that is worsened by the sudden increase in the cost of food and fuel and the consequences of climate change.  In order to achieve the MDGs by 2015  we are calling for strengthening the combined efforts of Governments  civil society organizations and the private sector in the context of a global alliance for stronger and more effective development  increasing official development assistance for the most vulnerable economies in particular.   We must not forget the thousands of millions of human beings worldwide who live below the poverty line. In our Latin American subcontinent  poverty has risen to 44 per cent of the population. In Paraguay  35.6 per cent of our citizens suffer from this scourge  and of those almost 20 per cent live below the line of extreme poverty. Malnutrition now affects four out of every 100 Paraguayan children. This situation is unacceptable and demands a radical change in the approach taken to combat this state of affairs. The most disadvantaged  those who remain in the sidelines of development are the ones we must listen to  and alleviating their suffering must be our priority.   Today more than ever  Paraguay requires international cooperation in achieving its socio-economic priorities  in developing and strengthening its institutions and in providing preferential attention to the most vulnerable sectors. We hope that the opening of developing countries will favour the most disadvantaged and that the same restrictions demanded in the development of more developed economies will not be applied.   We believe that this will be a vital tool for strengthening developing countries. That is why Paraguay signed the constitution of the Bank of the South and will continue to support the strengthening of that institution so that it can meet its objectives of financing the balanced and stable economic and social development of its member States  promoting macroeconomic stability and strengthening integration in order to set the foundation for regional and financial autonomy. However  that does not mean that we no longer require the support  resources and cooperation of the most developed countries for the two modes of cooperation are complementary for development.   Paraguay believes that the international community should ensure that the mobilization of external resources becomes a priority for international financial bodies and the developed economies. To that end  we must regain the level of expansion of official development assistance  which in recent years has been shrinking in a disturbing fashion.  Terrorism must be eradicated from the face of the Earth. There is nothing more dangerous to the unity of civilization than terrorism as a fact of daily life: the terrorism that kills children through hunger; the terrorism of weapons anywhere; the terrorism that affects children in my country who die because of toxic produce; the terrorism that killed our brothers in the Twin Towers  which will continue to kill as long as war remains a business for a few and fanaticism continues to cloud our hearts.  I know that love is a word not frequently used in political discourse  but there is no other way to rebuild a world so disfigured by hate. We must not forget individuals who  for various physical and mental    08-51749 10  reasons  have special capacities. Those are our dearest brothers and sisters in a world that often excludes those who cannot compete in terms of physical strength or thought. We must create conditions to enable them to share in our everyday lives without suffering the burden of exclusion or indifference. Our efforts to support that sector of the population need not be extraordinary but should be carried out in daily actions  rich in sharing and informed by an awareness of brotherhood and nature.   In this globalized world where things happen so quickly and communication is immediate  we see clearly its greatest technological advancements  its powerful financial architecture and its scientific plans to colonize the universe  but  we have to ask ourselves  where has the human being been left in all of this?   Men and women must always remain at the centre of that scenario. The only thing that will save us from post-modern savagery is if they recover their place from which no one should ever have been exiled. Humanity is the only value shared  without a single difference  by a child dying of hunger in a developing country and a child who eats breakfast every day in a developed country.   Paraguay is a small country in the world  but it believes in friendship. That is why we have set 30 July as the Day of Friendship. We hope that this initiative will resonate in various regions of the world and that friendship  with its values and its principles  sooner rather than later will replace the hostility which is so present in our times."
"144",5834,"PSE",63,2008,"At the outset  I congratulate you  Sir  on your election as President of the General Assembly for this session. We wish you every success and express our confidence that you will continue to pursue the great mission undertaken by the United Nations  which constitutes a monumental achievement in the history of humankind towards the promotion of dialogue and understanding and the resolution of issues and conflicts. That mission continues to be carried out in accordance with the rules and principles of international law  including humanitarian law  and on the basis of covenants that are consistent with the spirit of the times and the needs of the Organization in resolving problems and conflicts and confronting the enormous challenges before us  including poverty  hunger  the environment and climate change.  On this occasion  I also wish to commend the role and positive contributions of your predecessor  Mr. Srgjan Kerim  during the sixty-second session of the General Assembly. I would also like to express our deep appreciation for the efforts  positions and initiatives of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. They reflect his foresight and pragmatism regarding the various issues before us and in all regions that are suffering crises and that pose threats to world peace  including in particular in the Middle East region.    37 08-52272   I highly value the Secretary-General’s understanding of the need to address the political and humanitarian issues concerning the Palestinian people and our region  along with the important role that continues to be played by various United Nations agencies  including the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA)  which continues to shoulder great burdens  especially in the Gaza Strip and in the refugee camps in the West Bank  Lebanon  Jordan and Syria. In the absence of such a continuous  outstanding role  we would have suffered even more severe and perilous crises than we have experienced to date.  This year  I should have liked to bear news of the achievement of a comprehensive agreement between us and our Israeli neighbours  bringing an end to the Israeli occupation of our land since 1967 and to the suffering of the millions of our people living as refugees and displaced persons in exile from their homeland. I believe that the entire world  with its differing alliances and trends  shares that desire with me  especially following the Annapolis conference late last year and the relaunching of the political process. That set the necessary guidelines for the advancement of negotiations towards the conclusion of a comprehensive and complete agreement on all final status issues. Such an agreement would lead to the realization of peace within our region and allow it to enter a qualitatively new era of relations characterized by good-neighbourliness  mutual recognition  security and open borders  and not by walls and barriers.  I am certain that never in the history of the conflict in our region have so many countries gathered as those that attended the Annapolis conference or participated in the consensus that arose there. Those who met not only demanded vigorous action to accelerate and advance negotiations towards the achievement of a final peace agreement  but also explicitly emphasized the need to remove all of the obstacles that have continuously impeded the negotiating process and cast doubt on its credibility  usefulness and ability to actually resolve all aspects of the conflict. The main obstacle I refer to is that of the Israeli settlement campaign and its continuation throughout the occupied Palestinian territory  particularly in East Jerusalem.  All of the participants in Annapolis took a united  firm and unprecedented stand calling for the immediate cessation of illegal settlement activities. It was recognized that this was a prerequisite for allowing the negotiations to resolve the conflict to lead to an end to the occupation and the grave  historical injustices inflicted on our people over the long decades.  The participation of most brotherly Arab countries in the Annapolis conference was not merely a symbolic gesture. On the contrary  their participation  in terms of both the level of attendance and the substance of positions  was a reflection of their genuine desire to embrace and support the political process and to address it in real earnest on the basis of the Arab peace initiative adopted at the Arab summit in Beirut in 2002.  Allow me  from this rostrum to recall once again the special importance of the Arab peace initiative. I do this personally in order to draw attention to the significance of each of its platforms  because it represents a major joint Arab undertaking and offers a historic opportunity for us to achieve peace  security and mutual recognition for all.  Indeed  it is strange to hear comments  which we do not understand or accept  that are used to justify the continuing settlements in East Jerusalem and the rest of the occupied Palestinian territory and refer to the land as if it were not occupied territory or as if peace were possible without an end to the occupation of all of the Arab territories occupied since 1967  including the occupied Syrian Golan and the Lebanese Sheba’a Farms  and without an end to the occupation of East Jerusalem  the capital of our future Palestinian State and a city holy to hundreds of millions of the faithful of the monotheistic religions.   For the purpose of the noble and peaceful objectives of building of a new Middle East free of destructive mindsets and irrational tendencies that run counter to the highest human values preached by all religions and creeds — a new Middle East free of weapons of mass destruction — we have been and remain committed to international legitimacy. We extend our hands for dialogue and negotiation to resolve the conflict in a way that provides all that is required for coexistence and openness to the future so we can build our societies and nations in accordance with the aspirations of our peoples to progress and in the spirit of the times.  In that context  we express our full support for the continuation of the indirect talks currently taking place between Syria and Israel with the help of sisterly    08-52272 38  Turkey. We hope that the process will culminate in the achievement of justice  the implementation of international resolutions and the affirmation of international legitimacy.  For our part  we will continue to strive to achieve the maximum possible progress in the current negotiations between us and Israel through this year  benefiting from past experience and relying on the desire of all our peoples to realize a genuine and comprehensive peace that will end decades of occupation and hostilities and result in the attainment of the two-State solution — the State of Palestine living alongside the State of Israel on the basis of the 1967 borders — and a just and agreed solution to the plight of the Palestinian refugees in accordance with resolution 194 (III). In referring to the benefits of past experience  I wish to convey clearly that partial or interim solutions or the dropping or deferral of those core issues are unacceptable and unviable and will maintain the roots of the conflict  thus undermining any achievement on the road to peace. The solution must be comprehensive  complete  detailed and wholehearted.  The solution we aspire to must include a mechanism to ensure its full and faithful implementation pursuant to the timetable agreed upon. All that inevitably requires international supervision of the implementation of the solution  as well as a more effective role for the international Quartet in safeguarding the solution we will reach and an effective guarantor role for the Security Council and various other United Nations bodies.  At this juncture  I would like to express our appreciation for the role played by the United States Administration  President George Bush and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice in advancing the negotiations and the peace process  as well as their efforts to remove the obstacles that stand in its way. I also wish to commend the positions taken by the Arab  Islamic and non-aligned countries  which have always taken firm stances in support of a just peace. I would like to express our appreciation for the role played by the European Union  which has supported our efforts in every possible way  and the role and positions of the Russian Federation  the People’s Republic of China and Japan  as well as of our friends and colleagues in Latin America and Africa who have always supported the advancement and continuity of the political process.  As humankind celebrates the sixtieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  the conditions being endured by our people are increasingly severe and complex. Our nation  which possesses only a small area of land  continues to suffer the fragmentation and discontiguity of its cities and villages as a result of more than 600 checkpoints and roadblocks on all main and secondary roads. There is no precedent for that in modern history. The harshest and most painful of those barriers are those that have surrounded occupied East Jerusalem  severing the link between it and its Palestinian surroundings  not to mention changing the Islamic and Christian character of our city.  Attacks by Israeli settlers on Palestinian civilians have become daily occurrences. At the same time  ongoing tragedies strike every Palestinian family with the continuing detention and imprisonment of over 11 000 Palestinians in Israeli jails. I know of no situation in today’s world comparable to ours  where a people is subject to the detention of such large numbers of its civilians and where prisons continue to be filled with more and more accused who are guilty only of wanting to be free and of envisioning a future that is different from the reality of occupation  siege and the loss of hope.  Despite those harsh circumstances  our National Authority and governing institutions have exerted every possible effort to improve our conditions in all fields  including the security  economic  education  health and cultural sectors.  I wish to express our gratitude to our brothers in the Arab countries  to the General Secretariat of the League of Arab States  and to the whole international community for all the important assistance extended to our people and our Authority in all aspects of the endeavour to restore the Palestinian economy  provide real opportunities for its advancement  and rebuild the Palestinian security apparatus and the various institutions and agencies of the Palestinian Authority.  In that regard  I wish to convey special thanks and appreciation to all the envoys from other countries who have provided assistance in several fields  particularly Mr. Tony Blair  the Quartet Special Envoy. It is with pride that I can say that  even under those most difficult conditions we have been able to achieve security  the rule of law and public order for most of   39 08-52272  our towns and districts  despite all the remaining obstacles we have to confront.  However  we will continue to follow that same path with firm determination and resolve. In that connection  the Paris Donor’s Conference  followed by the Bethlehem economic conference  were two special occasions in support of our national economy  our financial and economic institutions and treasury  and assistance to the Palestinian private sector  which has unwaveringly borne heavy burdens over the past years and has not failed to develop and progress.  There is no doubt that the ongoing siege of the Gaza Strip  where unemployment is endemic  is compounding the tragic humanitarian crisis there. It is unprecedented in scope and scale  and the opportunities for education and medical care are scarce  punishing and causing the malnutrition of an entire generation with all the consequent risks for the future of the entire people.  All of that is in addition to the transformation of the Gaza Strip into a huge virtual prison holding nearly 1.5 million Palestinians. We have exerted all efforts to get the siege on Gaza lifted  this dear part of our homeland. In that regard  we express our deep appreciation for the role played by the brotherly Arab countries  especially Egypt  to alleviate the suffering and to help us save our people from the extremely difficult situation they find themselves in  including in particular their efforts to end the division resulting from the bloody coup led by Hamas against Palestinian legitimacy more than a year ago.  As I have on more than one occasion  I would like to reaffirm once again from this rostrum that we will spare no effort to achieve Palestinian national reconciliation. We have already announced a preliminary plan that opens the door for this reconciliation to be realized and the formation of an independent  impartial Government that is acceptable to all  but that will not place us back under siege again. This Government will prepare for the holding of legislative and presidential elections. We will continue building a security apparatus based on professional tenets  with the support of Arab security. After the completion of those steps  it will be possible for us to proceed further towards strengthening our reconciliation and deepening the participation of all. If that is not actualized  whoever rejects those principles and does not conform with them must bear the responsibility before our entire people and before the Arab and international positions that reject this disintegration and division.  In concluding my statement  I recall the words of our great Palestinian poet  Mahmoud Darwish  whom we recently lost and whose loss was that of a great cultural and humanitarian symbol and icon. Mahmoud Darwish glorified life and cherished his homeland  calling on our new generations to love life on their land and to preserve its continuity and to keep the torch always lit. Mahmoud Darwish said   “On this land there is something that deserves life  on this land there was first the beginning and the end — a land called Palestine — a name that was and is and will endure”.

"145",5880,"QAT",63,2008,"I should like at the outset to congratulate you  Su  on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session. I wish you every success in your mission.  I should like also to thank your predecessor  Mr. Srgjan Kerim  for all of his efforts in the previous session. I should further like to thank the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  for his efforts to promote and revitalize the role of the United Nations.  I need not remind anyone in this Hall  which holds such a high-level assembly  that the primary goal of this Organization and the fundamental purpose of its Charter is to achieve and maintain world peace.  The human experience replete with hopes and horrors reminds us all that world peace can only be achieved by a conscious  positive act and not through mere wishful thinking. We have sought to achieve peace through war in which the powerful tried to impose their will  as in the two notorious world wars of the twentieth century.  We have sought to find peace through entente between empires  as between Britain and France in 1904. We sought peace through coexistence between the United States and the Soviet Union in 1971. In all those attempts  either by war or by entente between Powers  by agreement between empires or by coexistence between blocs and doctrines  peace has remained elusive.  We have all come to realize through those long and exhausting experiences that achieving peace is a positive act that means more than just eliminating the threat of weapons. While it is true that humanity has not suffered a global war in the past 60 years  it is also true that peace in those last six decades has remained elusive. It has been a peace beset by conflicts on all continents and in all territories. We have also come to the conclusion that in a world where barriers of distance and time have come to evaporate  achieving peace means establishing and promoting economic and social justice among peoples. That is what constitutes positive peace.  If the purposes and principles of the Charter have established the political rights of nations on the basis of international law  the right of peoples to social   17 08-51570  justice must be based on the idea of development. In the past  the first generation of advocates and supporters of national liberation movements demanded what they called “positive neutrality”  believing that they could thus distance themselves from the wars of the major powers. However  the realities of today’s world require a different approach  for peace cannot be achieved through conflict between powers  agreement between empires  or coexistence among blocs  and not even through positive neutrality.  The alternative to those three options is our new choice  namely positive peace  an era of international law that ensures political rights and an era of development offering parallel and equal opportunities in one world  which cannot go into the future burdened by the injustices of politics or blinded by the darkness of underdevelopment.  Qatar is getting ready to host the follow-up International Conference on Financing for Development. My country looks forward to an international cooperation that offers the broadest base possible for political as well as social peace. We hope that participation the conference will be at the highest possible level. The goal is ambitious and the purpose is vital for the safety and peace of the one human global village. "
"146",5926,"ROU",63,2008,"Romania fully associates itself with the statement made on behalf of the European Union by President Nicolas Sarkozy. I should simply like to make a few remarks with regard to issues of particular interest to my Government. I should like to frame my statement around two words: responsibility and solidarity.  The basic purpose of the high-level meeting that took place on 25 September was to review the progress made in the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals and evaluate the feasibility of achieving them. It was a matter not of whether they were appropriate or reasonable  which they obviously are  but rather of determining the viability of implementing them in the face of new challenges. The conclusion was that international cooperation and determination could provide a solution  provided that responsibilities were met and solidarity forthcoming. In doing so  we would be making the idea of community concrete.  With regard to climate change  the world energy crisis and food security  I should simply like to say that the vulnerability of nature is inevitably linked to our increased technological capacity to influence the climate — sometimes irreversibly — through the cumulative effects of human activity; hence the moral imperative of responsibility to the future. We cannot separately or individually find solutions to the problems that affect us all  in particular global warming and the energy crisis.  In the face of all those interconnected challenges  it is our responsibility to better equip the United Nations with the necessary means to coordinate effective joint efforts. The revitalization of the General Assembly  system-wide coherence  Security Council reform and  not least  the reform of the Department of Political Affairs are all areas in which we have a responsibility to make significant progress. It is encouraging that there has been an effort to find common denominators in many projects and initiatives.  Any reform of the Security Council must take into account the legitimate aspirations of the regional groups  with the ultimate goal of ensuring a more representative  legitimate  transparent and effective Council.  If we expect results from the United Nations  we must provide it with the appropriate resources. Following the reform of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations  it is only logical to strengthen the capacity for analysis  political mediation  foresight and preventive diplomacy of the Department of Political Affairs. My country is ready once again support the initiative for institutional consolidation  in particular as regards a European regional office charged with expanding its reach to the Western Balkans and the Black Sea region.   United Nations regional political offices could also increase their cooperation with regional and subregional organizations  whose resources should be in synergy with those of the global Organization. The cooperation between the United Nations  the African Union and other subregional organizations during the recent crises in the Darfur region of the Sudan  in Kenya and in Zimbabwe are all encouraging examples. We also welcome the ongoing cooperation between the United Nations and the International Organization of la Francophonie.  I should now like to say a few words on democratization. Romania welcomes the substantial expansion and improvement of cooperation in the Conference of New or Restored Democracies  including the unprecedented efforts of Qatar in that regard.  A/63/PV.13   08-53122 34   The current challenges should give rise to renewed international cooperation. The network of democratic solidarity that provides support to countries emerging from conflict or from autocratic regimes is founded on a philosophy of freedom that repudiates threats from international terrorism or radicalism  which have developed their own network as a sort of parallel globalization based on fear. However  the international network of cooperation should not have anxiety and fragility as its common denominators  but instead the natural propensity of States and organizations that share the same values  principles and objectives  namely  freedom and respect for the law and the dignity of the human being. Allow me to recall that  on Romania’s initiative  in 2000 the General Assembly adopted its comprehensive resolution 55/96  which set out the defining characteristics of democracy.  Peacekeeping missions remain the backbone of the international role of the United Nations. Post-conflict normalization and rebuilding should be an integral part of the international strategy to deal with potential breaches of peace or the reignition of conflicts. My country acknowledges and praises the endeavours of United Nations personnel in Kenya  Iraq  Myanmar  northern Uganda  Somalia  Cyprus  the Central African Republic and Nepal.  The progress made in Iraq and Afghanistan should trigger renewed solidarity with the peoples of those countries. The efforts of the international community to stabilize and ensure the success of the ongoing deep transformations in Iraq and Afghanistan should be matched by renewed commitment on the part of the Iraqi and Afghan political leadership to reach compromises and comprehensive agreements allowing for political reconciliation and economic development.  Romania remains committed to the democratic future of both countries. Romania was first among the countries that are not members of the Paris Club to agree  in 2005  to the terms of debt relief for Iraq. The NATO summit held this year in Bucharest reconfirmed solidarity and engagement with Afghanistan. Any security agreements to complement or replace the current security arrangements in Iraq have to take into account the need to ensure the protection of United Nations personnel in order that the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq and the Organization’s specialized agencies  funds and programmes can properly fulfil their extended mandates in Iraq.  I should now like to say a few words about the Human Rights Council. Romania has encouraging expectations following the start of the activities of the Council’s Universal Periodic Review mechanism. Under the Romanian presidency  the Council examined 32 national reports  including my country’s own report. The debates generated valuable recommendations and entailed remarkable commitments with regard to the universal application of recognized international standards for human rights and fundamental freedoms. We should not weaken our support for the Human Rights Council or for the Office of the High Commissioner.  The widespread impact of humanitarian crises resulting from conflicts and natural disasters requires  again and again  our solidarity with the people in need. The tragedy of 7 million Sudanese  almost 5 million Palestinian refugees  5 million Iraqi internally displaced persons and refugees  3 million Afghan refugees and 1.4 million Congolese and 1 million Somali internally displaced persons should catalyse concrete actions of assistance. The recent Georgian crisis also added to the international statistics on internally displaced persons and refugees. Yet  numbers as such should not obscure in our conscience the terrible individual tragedies implied by these humanitarian catastrophes.  Aware of that plight  Romania is preparing to host a special evacuation transit centre for persons in urgent need of international protection and onward resettlement. The centre would provide temporary shelter for refugees facing immediate danger in their countries of origin  pending final resettlement in third countries.  The appalling humanitarian crises of recent decades should prompt a renewed effort to define ways to prevent and adequately react to such situations and  furthermore  to rebuild for durable conflict resolution. Further efforts should be made to forge a common understanding of the conditions and application of the principle of the responsibility to protect.   Romania resolutely promotes international cooperation in the areas of crime prevention and believes that prosecutorial services represent one of the main pillars of the criminal justice system. My country is preparing to host  in March 2009  the third world  A/63/PV.13 35 08-53122  summit of attorneys general  prosecutors general and chief prosecutors. The meeting is to be organized with the support of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and will focus on prosecutorial independence for effectiveness  integrity and public confidence. We look forward to welcoming the international community’s representatives in Bucharest next spring.  Allow me now to turn to the issue of protracted conflicts. It has always been striking to hear the recurrent references to frozen conflicts. Let us be honest: no conflict stays frozen indefinitely without consequences. The recent crisis in Georgia proved that the international community cannot hide or shy away from dealing with uncertain situations under the assumption that they will simply disappear eventually. On the contrary  uncertain situations and grey zones gradually produce effects  effect changes in the status quo and can  from apparent tranquillity  spew forth the magma of delayed — and thus amplified — conflicts. A dormant volcano can still be an active one. Unsolved issues carrying latent threats are not socially or politically neutral  since they generate new realities and risks to stability and security.  Deferring the solution of a crisis is not a suitable answer. Only a negotiated formula  with the support of bona fide international and regional mediation and assistance  can provide long-term and enduring solutions. The crisis in South Ossetia  with its reverberations in Abkhazia and the entire State of Georgia and beyond  should focus the attention of the international community on all protracted conflicts in the area  including Transdniestria and Nagorny Karabakh.  We have to have a new energetic and comprehensive approach to the so-called protracted conflicts. It is time to jointly understand the danger and take action. The United Nations and its Security Council should play their parts and accordingly assume their responsibility. Hesitation is not helping. Full observance of all principles and norms of international law  including the territorial integrity of States  is a must for all of us if we want peace  security  stability and prosperity to prevail.  One of the main objectives of the international community should be to consolidate stabilization and a democratic future across the entire Black Sea region. Romania promotes a wide range of cooperation ideas in the Black Sea area. If we take a closer look  we can see a region with a large population  an important hub for energy and transport flows and great economic potential. The United Nations should be there to assist the region  not only in unfreezing conflicts but also in helping coastal countries to cooperate to solve problems related to pollution  illegal migration  organized crime and drug trafficking  so as to project stability and to support development.  I now turn to disarmament  non-proliferation and the fight against terrorism. I should like to underline that responsibility and solidarity are also basic pillars of the international norms in that regard. That leads me to say  as many before me have done  that statements such as the one made a few days ago in the Assembly about Israel are unacceptable.  First  every State has an essential responsibility to effectively and comprehensively implement its commitments by promoting the necessary legal framework and establishing appropriate mechanisms for verification and control.  Secondly  there is a need for solidarity and cooperation at the regional and multilateral levels so that national measures and actions are recognized and implemented. Romania has always demonstrated its interest and readiness to work together with all States members of the international community in that respect. The most recent proof of that is the contribution of my country to the seven-nation initiative on nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation launched by Norway in 2005. Concrete examples of our involvement include the international seminar on how the Black Sea region can contribute to improved global security  which was hosted in Bucharest in 2007  and other activities aimed at promoting the objectives of that cross-regional initiative.  Allow me to conclude by calling for effective multilateralism and the strengthening of the United Nations. After all  some questioned the relevance of the United Nations after the end of the cold war. The Organization has never lacked for criticism or scepticism. We do not believe the issue to be one of trying to regain a sense of lost purpose. The United Nations continues to be the broadest and most inclusive Organization in the world and enjoys a special reputation and legitimacy. The United Nations provides a forum for all Member States — large or A/63/PV.13   08-53122 36  small  rich or poor  developed or developing — to have their voices heard and heeded.   Instead  the question for all Member States is how to make the world Organization and its specialized agencies  funds and programmes more effective  responsible and coherent in the face of new and ongoing challenges. If the moral imperative that should lead us to carry out our responsibilities and demonstrate solidarity in order to advance the cause of humankind is not enough  then what we need is to look towards the pragmatic aspect  namely  the utility and sense implied in the fact that the world’s well-being contributes to the well-being of our own countries and citizens.  History is a good teacher  provided we learn from its lessons. History shows us the virtues of joint efforts and the benefits of cooperation. We are still far from the Kantian dream of a stable world order that is democratic and prosperous. But we can move ever closer to it through multilateralism and the strengthening of the United Nations. "
"147",5972,"RUS",63,2008,"On 11 September 2001  the world changed  and it rallied together in the fight against the threat of terror  a threat that was common for all and knew no boundaries. I am referring to threat of terrorism. The world displayed an unprecedented level of solidarity by rejecting old phobias and stereotypes. It seemed that the global counter-terrorism coalition became a new reality that from then on would define the development of a system of international relations free from double standards and beneficial to all.  The cohesion in the face of the deadly threats emerging from Al-Qaida and other elements of international terrorism made it possible to achieve tangible success during the initial stage. But later  problems began to appear. A painful blow to the unity of the anti-terrorism coalition was delivered by the war in Iraq  when — as it turned out later  under the false pretext of the fight against terror and nuclear arms proliferation — international law was violated. The deepest crisis was thus created in a completely artificial way and even today it is far from being resolved.  Ever more questions are being raised about what is going on in Afghanistan. First and foremost  what is the acceptable price to pay in terms of the loss of civilians’ lives in the ongoing counter-terrorism operation? Who decides on criteria for determining proportionality in the use of force? And why are the international contingents that are present unwilling to engage in the fight against the proliferating drug threat that causes increasing suffering in the countries of Central Asia and Europe? These and other factors give us reason to believe that the counter-terrorism coalition is faced with a crisis.   Looking at the core of the problem  it seems that this coalition lacks the requisite collective arrangements: equality among all its members in deciding on strategy and  especially  operational tactics. But in order to control the entirely new situation that evolved after 9/11  which required genuine cooperative effort  including joint analysis and coordination of practical steps  mechanisms designed for a unipolar world began to be used; decisions were taken in a single centre of power  while the rest merely had to follow.  We ended up with a privatization of the international community’s efforts in the fight against terrorism. The inertia of the unipolar world also revealed itself in other spheres of international life  including unilateral steps taken in anti-missile defence and the militarization of outer space as well as in attempts to bypass parity in arms control regimes  expansion of political-military blocs  and politicization    08-53129 2  of the issues of access to and transport of energy resources.  The illusion of the existence of a unipolar world confused many. For some people  it generated a desire to place all of their eggs in one basket. In exchange for absolute loyalty  there was an expectation of carte blanche to resolve all problems  using any means. The emerging syndrome of complete permissiveness that developed led to a rampage on the night of 8 August  when aggression was unleashed on South Ossetia. The bombing of the sleeping city of Tskhinvali and the killing of civilians and peacekeepers trampled under foot all existing settlement agreements  thus putting an end to the territorial integrity of Georgia.  Russia helped South Ossetia to repel that aggression  and carried out its duty to protect its citizens and fulfil its peacekeeping commitments. Russia’s recognition of the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia was the only possible step to ensure not only their security  but also the very survival of their peoples  considering the previous record of chauvinism of the Georgian leaders — starting with the Georgian leader Zviad Gamsakhurdia who  in 1991  under the slogan of “Georgia for Georgians”  ordered the deportation of Ossetians to Russia  abolished the autonomous status of South Ossetia and Abkhazia and later unleashed a bloody war against them.   That war was brought to an end at the cost of innumerable human lives  and peacekeeping and negotiation mechanisms were established with the approval of the United Nations and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). However  the current Georgian leadership has pursued a persistent policy of undermining those mechanisms through relentless provocation  and finally nullified the peace process by launching a new murderous war on the night of 8 August.  This problem is now closed. The future of the peoples of Abkhazia and South Ossetia has been reliably secured by the treaties between Moscow and Tskhinvali and Sukhumi. With the implementation of the Medvedev-Sarkozy plan  to which we are strongly committed  the situation around the two republics will finally be stabilized. It is important that this plan should be strictly and unswervingly implemented by all parties. We are concerned  however  by the attempts to rewrite it after the fact.  I believe that everyone here has tired of playing the role of extras for the Georgian regime  whose words contain not a shred of truth and whose foreign policy is aimed exclusively at provoking confrontation throughout the world in the pursuit of their own objectives which invariably run counter to the objectives of the Georgian people and to the goal of ensuring security in the Caucasus.  Today  it is necessary to analyse the crisis in the Caucasus from the viewpoint of its impact on the region and the international community as a whole. The world has changed yet again. It has become absolutely clear that the solidarity demonstrated after 9/11 must be revived through approaches untainted by geopolitical expediency and built on the rejection of double standards when fighting against any violations or breaches of international law — whether on the part of terrorists  political extremists or any others.  The crisis in the Caucasus has proved again that it is impossible to resolve the problems we face when blinded by the mirage of a unipolar world. The price we will have to pay in terms of human lives and destinies is too high. We cannot tolerate any attempts to resolve conflict situations by violating international agreements or by the unlawful use of force. If we allow that to occur once  then we run the risk of unleashing it in the future.  One cannot invoke the duty to defend in the abstract  and then be outraged when that principle is used in practice — and in strict conformity with Article 51 of the United Nations Charter and other norms of international law. In South Ossetia  Russia defended the highest of our common values  the most essential human right: the right to live.   The existing security architecture in Europe did not pass the test of recent events. Attempts to adjust it to the rules of a unipolar world led to a situation where that architecture proved incapable of containing an aggressor or  preventing the supply of offensive weapons to it  contrary to all existing relevant codes of conduct.  We propose that this issue should be addressed in a comprehensive manner. President Dmitry A. Medvedev  of Russia  speaking in Berlin on 5 June  proposed an initiative on developing a Euro-Atlantic security treaty  a type of “Helsinki II”. This work could have been started at the Pan-European summit with the   3 08-53129  participation of all States as well as all organizations working in the region.  The treaty which we are proposing is meant to create a reliable collective security system that would ensure equal security for all States and set out  in legally binding form  the bases of relations among all participants  with a view to strengthening peace  ensuring stability and promoting integrated and manageable development efforts across the vast Euro-Atlantic region. This would be a process in which all parties would reaffirm their commitment to fundamental principles of international law  such as the non-use of force; peaceful settlement of disputes; sovereignty; territorial integrity; non-interference in internal affairs; and the inadmissibility of strengthening one’s own security by infringing upon or endangering the security of others. We also need to consider together new mechanisms to ensure compliance with those fundamental principles. Naturally  such a treaty should organically fit into the legal framework of the United Nations Charter and its principles of collective security.  The cold war distorted the nature of international relations and turned them into an arena for ideological confrontation. Only now  after the cold war has ended  can the United Nations  created on the basis of a polycentric vision of the world  fully realize its potential. Today as never before  it is important that all States reaffirm their commitment to the United Nations as a global forum  to which there is no alternative and which possesses a universal mandate and generally recognized legitimacy  and as a centre for open  candid and frank debate and coordination of world policies on a just and equitable basis free from double standards. This is an essential requirement to ensure that the world regains its equilibrium.  The multitude of challenges that humanity is facing require comprehensive strengthening of the United Nations. In order to keep up with the times  the United Nations requires further rational reform to be able to gradually adapt itself to existing political and economic realities. On the whole  we are satisfied by the progress of the reform  including the initial results of the activities of the recently established Peacebuilding Commission and the Human Rights Council.   With regard to expansion of the membership of the Security Council  we will  of course  welcome proposals that do not divide United Nations Member States but rather facilitate the search for mutually acceptable compromises and lead to a broad-based agreement.  Of increasing importance in the reform process is the promotion of dialogue and partnership among civilizations. Russia supports the Alliance of Civilizations and other initiatives in that regard. We reiterate our proposal that a consultative council of religions be established under United Nations auspices  taking into account the increasing role of the religious aspect in international life. That would assist in strengthening moral principles and incorporating them into international affairs.   Among the priorities of United Nations activities  a number of urgent issues have recently appeared on the Organization’s agenda  including climate change and food and energy security. Those problems are global and interrelated  and they can be addressed and resolved only through a global partnership at a qualitatively new level  with active involvement by Governments  the scientific and business communities and civil society.  In particular  the current financial crisis requires urgent attention and synergy of efforts. From this rostrum  the President of France has put forward important initiatives aimed at a cooperative search for ways to revitalize the international financial system that involve the world’s leading economies. In that context  we support the further development of partnerships between the members of the Group of Eight and key States in all developing regions. The Economic and Social Council could also play a role here. Russia will continue to participate responsibly in the work of various bodies of the United Nations system and in other contexts to help find an equitable solution to all those problems.  The international development assistance mechanisms being established in Russia will help us to increase the extent and effectiveness of our participation in international efforts to fight hunger and disease  to promote broader access to education and to overcome energy shortages  which will be our additional contribution to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. It is only natural that  in so doing  we should pay particular attention to assisting nearby countries. All countries have partners with which they share traditional friendly relations    08-53129 4  based on a common history and geography. It is wrong to artificially undermine such relationships for the benefit of geopolitical schemes and against the will of the people.   We will continue to work together with all our neighbours. First and foremost  along with the other countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States  we will continue to develop the integration processes within the Collective Security Treaty Organization and the Eurasian Economic Community in order to preserve and promote our common heritage of culture and civilization  which  in a globalizing world  is a major resource of the Commonwealth and of each of its member States. That is why we have a particular interest in cooperating with those countries  and it is also why they view Russia as an area of special interest. We will therefore base our relations on the principles of equality  mutual benefit  respect for and consideration of one another’s interests and compliance with existing agreements  in particular those on the peaceful settlement of disputes. That is also the way in which we intend to develop our relations in other regions of the world: openly  on the basis of international law and without any zero-sum games. Those principles were set out in the foreign policy concept approved by President Medvedev in July this year.   Russia is consistently implementing its network diplomacy and promoting cooperation in various formats: the Shanghai Cooperation Organization  the BRIC countries — Brazil  Russia  India and China — partnership mechanisms with the European Union  the Association of Southeast Asian Nations  the Organization of the Islamic Conference  the League of Arab States and regional organizations in Latin America.  The developments that occurred in August gave us yet another occasion to think about the responsibility to report events accurately. Distortions of reality hamper international efforts to settle conflicts and crises and revive the worst practices of the cold-war era. If we wish to prevent the truth from becoming the first casualty of war  we must draw the appropriate conclusions  in particular in the light of a provision of the 1970 Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations  which states that States have the duty to refrain from propaganda for wars of aggression. That is in line with the Guidelines on protecting freedom of expression and information in times of crisis  recently adopted by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe. I propose that the United Nations also issue a statement on that issue  this time in a universal context.   The obvious global effects of the crisis in the Caucasus show that the world has changed for everyone. There are now fewer illusions and fewer pretexts for refusing to respond to the most urgent challenges of modern times. That is precisely why we hope that the international community will  on the basis of common sense  finally manage to develop a programme of collective action for the twenty-first century. "
"148",6019,"RWA",63,2008,"We are gathered here once again to reflect on major national  regional and global challenges — and on how together  as the United Nations  we can renew our commitment to finding solutions. It gives me great pleasure to share with the General Assembly some insights on how some of those global developments affect Rwanda  as well as our region  as we continue to strengthen our social  economic and democratic institutions for improving the lives of our citizens.   In the context of fighting poverty and achieving the Millennium Development Goals  our second-generation poverty-reduction strategy is gathering momentum in Africa  East Africa and Rwanda  and is being implemented in the context of greater stability and peace. In Rwanda we are registering a healthy economic growth rate  which is currently averaging 7 per cent annually  in an increasingly open and conducive environment that encourages domestic and foreign investors. We also continue to deepen our regional integration in the East African community. That is essential for a bigger and more dynamic market  which should become a far more effective and efficient gateway to global business.  With regard to empowering women and promoting their socio-economic and political participation  we continue to make significant progress. In the just-concluded Rwandan parliamentary elections for the lower chamber  women candidates performed exceptionally well  increasing their presence in the new Parliament from 49 to 55 seats. We believe that  besides improving gender status in our country  that marks healthy progress towards realizing a vision of a united  democratic and prosperous Rwanda.    08-51606 6   Allow me to raise another issue that may have wider implications  namely  that of justice and  more specifically  of universal jurisdiction and its abuse. It is important that those who consider themselves powerful nations do not misuse that tool of international justice to extend their laws and jurisdiction over those they perceive to be weaker countries. If unchecked  one can only imagine the legal chaos that would ensue should any judge in any country decide to apply local laws to other sovereign States. The United Nations has a duty to ensure that universal jurisdiction serves its original goals of delivering international justice and fairness  as opposed to abuse.  There is no doubt that climate change is among the critical challenges of our time. Africa is being gravely affected. Deserts and dry zones continue to claim more territory. Over-reliance on wood for energy by our populations is leading to severe deforestation. Furthermore  unpredictable weather and rainfall patterns  combined with limited scientific and technological capacities  are already undermining our continent’s ability to effectively manage water resources.   We take those challenges very seriously in Rwanda. Earlier this month  in Kigali  the Africa Climate Change Forum brought together policymakers  business leaders and academic and scientific communities from different parts of the world. They reaffirmed that the world community urgently needs to think globally  but also to act locally  in translating resolutions into actions. Towards that end  we are determined to intensify efforts in the areas of reforestation  terracing and irrigation for more effective use of water and land resources  as well as to prevent soil erosion. It is indispensable that we partner together as a global community to urgently act to protect our planet in the context of the Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol.  Rwanda is committed to regional and global peace and stability. Let us not forget that the process of comprehensively resolving the issue of those who committed genocide in Rwanda has yet to be completed. We stand ready to play our part in addressing that matter in the context of broader objectives to consolidate stability and peace on our continent. Once again  I assure the Assembly of our determination and commitment to creating a safer and better world. "
"149",6101,"SDN",63,2008,"It is indeed my pleasure  on behalf of the leadership  people and Government of the Sudan  to greet the General Assembly as it meets in its sixty-third session. We wish its deliberations every success and hope to witness tangible progress on all the issues and challenges that must be given priority by this Organization. We refer  of course  to the maintenance of international peace and security; realizing the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs); containing the food crisis  poverty  hunger  climate change and water shortages; and reactivating the role of the United Nations in a changing world.   We are indeed delighted to see Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann chairing this session. We are confident that  with his wisdom  experience and perspicacity  we may indeed be hopeful and optimistic that the international community will realize its ambitions for global development  reconstruction and prosperity.  I also wish to strongly commend and thank Ambassador Srgjan Kerim for the competence with which he conducted the work of the sixty-second session. We also thank the Secretary-General and his staff for the efforts that they continue to deploy in the service of the mandate of this Organization.  This session of the General Assembly falls amid some very important and particular developments in the international and regional spheres. Millions are looking forward to a world of peace  stability and prosperity that respects the common values and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations  notably respect for the sovereignty of States  their choices  the peaceful settlement of disputes and joint cooperation in all fields.  Although we continue to hope for and work towards a capable and efficient United Nations and a complete framework for multilateral cooperation that takes into consideration the wealth and diversity of the international community  we in the developing    08-51851 20  countries  especially in the African continent  remain profoundly convinced of the need to maintain those objectives and principles. We recall that our African continent has had a long and difficult journey as a result of its backwardness since it broke the yoke of colonialism and fought its post-independence wars  during which the objectives and aspirations of Africans to lead a dignified life were forever thwarted by the so-called lost decades of development and the unfavourable economic and trade atmosphere. The political and security situation of the African continent has made it vulnerable to foreign interventions and conspiracies that have undermined its stability and rendered peace a more distant prospect.   In addition to discussing the various and well-known threats and dangers facing the African continent and all developing nations  I should like to draw attention to and warn about the danger of the abuse of what is called “universal jurisdiction”. That concept that was condemned in July 2008 at the Sharm el-Sheikh summit  which called on the Security Council and the General Assembly to seriously examine the issue and to cancel it. The politicization and abuse of the aforementioned principle clearly shows that disregard for and non-compliance with political and professional norms that are guided by the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and of international law  together with the application of double standards  pose grave dangers for the region and beyond  threatening the stability and prestige of the institutions of the international order.  Achieving peace and stability in the Sudan has been a firm priority objective of our Government  which has demonstrated its commitment to the option of peace  as reflected in the historic milestone achieved when we signed the Comprehensive Peace Agreement on 9 January 2005 in Nairobi. The Agreement  which ended the longest-running conflict on the African continent since the colonial era  was reinforced by the Darfur Peace Agreement  signed at Abuja  and the Eastern Sudan Peace Agreement  signed at Asmara  Eritrea.  Our efforts to achieve peace have proceeded from our conviction that peace will create a favourable environment for the development of the Sudan’s vast agricultural resources and wealth  which in turn will ensure the sustainability of peace. Furthermore  peace in the Sudan is a strategic goal aimed at reinforcing stability in neighbouring countries  the region and the continent. Thus  we appeal to all members of the international community  through the Assembly  to support the efforts to achieve peace and stability in the Sudan. By so doing  they will promote  enhance and guarantee peace and stability in the region and on the African continent. We must avoid doing anything that could negatively affect or jeopardize those efforts.  While our country is firmly committed to implementing the provisions of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement  in particular by holding general elections during the first half of next year and by completing our national programmes for disarmament  demobilization and reintegration and de-mining  we hope that the international community will honour its financial commitments  including those pledges announced in Oslo in 2005 and in Norway in May 2008.  Here  in view of the difficulties and obstacles that we have encountered in implementing the Agreement  I should like to recall a principle of Western thought regarding the difference between words and deeds. We in the Sudan believe that our desire for the cancellation of our foreign debt is in accordance with the spirit and requirements of peace agreements  since that debt is hampering our reconstruction efforts. We also call for the lifting of the unilateral sanctions imposed against our country  which defeat the true purpose of a comprehensive peace. In that way  the citizens of the Sudan could benefit from the dividends of peace.  The problem of Darfur has been the chief concern of the people and the Government of the Sudan. No one is more eager than our people to achieve peace and stability in Darfur  which  after all  is their problem and their responsibility. From this rostrum  we reaffirm our full commitment to achieving a peaceful political settlement of the crisis in Darfur  one that will enhance the ongoing peace process through positive actions. These include the implementation of the People of the Sudan initiative  aimed at developing a national consensus as to the best way to resolve the issue  as stated by the President of the Republic during his recent important visit to Darfur; the appointment of Mr. Jebreel Basoli  Joint Chief Negotiator  whom we fully support; the establishment of an Arab-African committee  co-chaired by the Prime Minister of Qatar  the Chairperson of the Commission of the African Union and the Secretary-General of the League of Arab States  to mediate peace negotiations between the Government of the Sudan and the armed movements in   21 08-51851  Darfur  in close cooperation and coordination with the representatives of the African Union and the United Nations; and the implementation of the initiative that was supported and welcomed by the African Union  the League of Arab States and the Secretary-General of the United Nations. The Sudanese Government of National Unity sincerely hopes that those efforts will promptly lead to comprehensive peace and stability in Darfur.  We had hoped that the signing of the Darfur Peace Agreement on 5 May 2006 as a result of the generous mediation of the African Union would encourage the movements that had not signed the Comprehensive Peace Agreement to do so. In particular  in order to ensure full implementation of the Agreement  power-sharing and the establishment of the Transitional Darfur Regional Authority  male and female citizens of Darfur have been appointed to executive and legislative positions and various arrangements have been put in place to ensure wealth- and power-sharing and security.  However  as members are all aware  the movements that oppose peace have continued to boycott all the negotiations  undermining the efforts of Mr. Jan Eliasson and Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim. The movements have continued to reject the peace option and to choose the military option  not to serve the interests of the people of Darfur but to pursue a policy aimed at regime change in the Sudan  as demonstrated in the military aggression carried out on 10 May 2008 against the Sudanese capital itself. Those movements would not have been able to do what they did had they not been receiving mixed or wrong messages from some circles  since they saw that the non-signatories were not being pressured to join the organ of peace  while those who signed the treaty were. That increased the intransigence of the non-signatories  threatening the chances for peace and the humanitarian conditions.  With regard to peacekeeping — and in accordance with the principles of positive cooperation with the United Nations and the African Union under the agreement reached at the high-level understandings in Addis Ababa on 16 November 2006  which led to the adoption of Security Council resolution 1769 (2007) establishing the mandate of the joint African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID) — the Government of the Sudan has fulfilled its commitments with regard to its role in the peace process in Darfur and indeed has fulfilled many other steps. The status of forces agreement has been concluded. The mandate was transferred from the African Union Mission in the Sudan to UNAMID on 31 December of last year. The headquarters have been built and operational capacities have been established in the three states of Darfur. Periodic coordination meetings between the Government of the Sudan and the command of the joint operation have been deliberating on all the problems and resolving them.   On the humanitarian level  the Government of the Sudan remains committed to executing the humanitarian communiqué concluded with the United Nations on 28 March 2007  which is being implemented in an exemplary manner as a result of the matchless follow-up mechanism to track the implementation of the humanitarian communiqué and the special efforts of the Government to open humanitarian corridors in Darfur and to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid. Once again we renew our commitment to that effort.  At a time when the Government of National Unity has taken giant strides to implement the peace agreement  with the full support of the President of the Republic  the electoral law has been passed and approved by parliament to usher the Sudan to yet another phase of democratic transformation and peaceful transfer of power through general elections to be held in 2009.   The country is fully mobilized and engaged in turning over the page of violence and war in Darfur  and amid those developments came the request of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) to the Pre-Trial Chamber to issue an arrest warrant. An arrest warrant against whom? Against a man who ended the longest war in Africa  a man who brought peace to eastern Sudan and laid the foundations for peace in Darfur. That request targeted the leadership of the State  the symbol of its sovereignty and dignity  in a failed attempt at political and moral assassination  as well as causing delay or erosion of the peace process for ulterior motives unrelated to justice or to the realization of peace and stability in Darfur  and in a State that is not a signatory to the Rome Statute.   Moreover  the actions of the Prosecutor disregard the road map agreed upon by the Sudan  the United Nations and the African Union on the basis of the Addis Ababa understanding in November 2006 and the international conference on Darfur held alongside the last session of the General Assembly. The road map    08-51851 22  was further reiterated and endorsed by the Security Council in its resolution 1769 (2007). The road map was based on four tracks: rehabilitation and development  the peace process as a priority  the peacekeeping operation and the humanitarian track. Thus the Prosecutor is turning upside down the issue of accountability  which the Government of the Sudan supports and which is already being handled by a competent and effective Sudanese judiciary  and giving it a completely different character by introducing it into the International Criminal Court and destabilizing justice and peace in the Sudan and the region. It is an open invitation to the rebel movements that oppose peace to stay away from the peace option. The actions of the Prosecutor seek to influence negatively the elections to be held in 2009  through which the Government will enter into a new phase of peace and democratic transformation.  From this rostrum  in the name of the Government and the people of the Sudan  who were unanimous in rejecting that step  I thank and commend all the active forces of more than two thirds of the international community  which through their regional  geographic and political institutions and organizations have condemned the measures taken by the ICC Prosecutor and called on the Security Council to rectify the situation arising from that action. Here I specifically mean the member States of the African Union  the League of Arab States  the Non-Aligned Movement  the Organization of the Islamic Conference  the member States of the African  Caribbean and Pacific Group of States and other countries that have expressed their disapproval and their complete rejection of that step taken by the ICC Prosecutor.   I would like to assure the Assembly that the Government of the Sudan is making progress in its resolute and principled goal of achieving lasting peace and removing the bitterness of war and its legacy in accordance with the values and principles of the people of the Sudan and their mores  customs and traditions  which are based on peaceful coexistence  reconciliation and tolerance. The establishment of peace in Darfur and in the Sudan and the steps taken by the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court are two parallel lines that can never meet  hence such situations must be rectified as soon as possible and there must be a return to the commitment to the political process.  Since the issue of more democratic international relations was one of the subjects proposed for the general debate of this session  our country  like all other African countries  has been following the efforts to reform this Organization — especially the Security Council  which is charged with the maintenance of international peace and security and which has remained as it is since its inception while the entire international arena has been changing. That made reforming that Council an urgent priority  so that it can be more responsive to the aspirations of the developing nations.   I am referring specifically to Africa  which has no permanent representation in the Security Council  whose agenda is beset with African issues. Here I would like to reiterate that the Sudan is in accord with the African position included in the Ezulwini document on the issue of reforming the modus operandi and rules of procedure of the United Nations so that it can be more democratic  transparent  express equitable geographic representation of the world’s continents and reflect the developments that the world has seen since 1945.  Economic and trade developments compete with each other. The failure of economic structures in many developing and least developed countries constitutes a problem that raises obstacles for the movement to realize the MDGs as soon as possible. The current structure of the international economy  with its restrictive  unfair trade practices and restrictions on the exports of developing nations  is a negative impact of globalization  in addition to the heavy external debt burden that paralyzes the region’s national economic development. Those obstacles are very serious and retard development  especially in the African continent.   The United Nations Millennium Summit emphasized the special position of Africa as a priority with regard to international assistance and channels of cooperation and support through relevant initiatives like the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) and other regional  subregional and national initiatives.   Here  let me mention that the Sudan has implemented several quick-income projects and several short-term projects to benefit vulnerable groups. Regarding the attainment of MDGs — especially the alleviation of poverty  the development and support of education  health and the fight against diseases like   23 08-51851  malaria — the State is still directing its efforts to attain those objectives and to realize sustainable development. We must take into consideration the potential of the country and its vast resources  which  according to reports of relevant international organizations  make it capable of helping to solve the global food crisis by providing food for millions around the world.  National efforts in the Sudan can currently be seen in the context of efforts to develop and revitalize the agricultural sector and to realize a comprehensive green revolution. Here I must emphasize the serious negative impact of phenomena like climate change and environmental deterioration  which have constituted reasons for war and conflict in Africa. The conflict in Darfur is one practical example of the impact of those phenomena and how they directly affect the daily lives and needs of individuals.   The Sudan  as a party to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) since 1999  emphasizes the need to put more effort and coordination into intensifying multilateral action to face those phenomena and to achieve a more efficient system for the post-2012 era. Developing nations must also participate in dealing with the causes and effects of climate change.  The Sudan is of the view that developed nations should fulfil their commitments to capacity-building and should provide the financial and technical resources to support developing nations in facing those problems.  The Sudan emphasizes the fact that the maintenance of international peace and security requires  first and foremost  an urgent solution to the problem in Palestine and that the situation be dealt with in a decisive and serious manner  especially in view of the tragic situation that the Palestinian people in the occupied territories are facing. The international community is called upon today more than any other time to put pressure on the occupying authorities to abide by resolutions of international legitimacy so that the Palestinian people may realize their full right to self-determination and the establishment of an independent State with Jerusalem as its capital.   In conclusion  I would like to emphasize that for the United Nations to continue playing its important role imposes on us a collective responsibility to find the solid will and determination to make the Organization a truly collective framework for multilateral  international efforts to deal effectively and justly with international issues and problems. The United Nations must establish clear and transparent partnerships according to the Charter with regional organizations in order to realize regional and international peace and security. The Sudan  as a committed and active member of this Organization  will remain faithful to the objectives that constitute our collective effort.  "
"150",6146,"SEN",63,2008,"Mr. Miguel d’Escoto  in electing you to the presidency of the Assembly  Member States wished to show their confidence in your wealth of experience  as former Minister for Foreign Affairs  to successfully guide its work. The Senegalese delegation congratulates you through me. At the same time I wish to thank and congratulate our Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  who has taken many initiatives since he was elected as the leader of our Organization  as demonstrated by the recent meetings dealing with Africa.   Many heads of State have referred to the dizzying increase in the price of oil  including  just now  the President of the Dominican Republic. That is not by chance  because many of us have denounced the policy of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)  which establishes the price of oil as it wishes and tries to blame it on the increase in demand — as if we had never studied economics.   The assessments of our association have not been very optimistic  but it should be noted that the objectives set by the founding Members have not been achieved. I quote from the birth certificate of our Organization that one of the purposes was “to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom”. I believe that the United Nations has served humanity considerably by resolving some conflicts and by establishing lasting peace  but we must also recognize its shortcomings in many areas  including peace and in the economic field.   Today  populations throughout the world have great expectations of our meeting  because humanity  fortunately  still hopes  and that hope remains alive in the countries that are called poor  and indeed they are. But I usually say with regard to Africa that it is not poor  but rather that Africa is a continent that has been impoverished over five centuries of slavery and one century of colonization and exploitation. However  despite all of that  Africa has engaged itself in international cooperation — bilateral and multilateral.    08-51749 26  We also strive to contribute within the United Nations  for example to peace  which is one of the objectives of our Organization.   Experience teaches us that there are limits to our international system. As you  Mr. President  and the Secretary-General have both mentioned  we should look directly at the issues and undertake reforms. Above all  we must demonstrate imagination and a capacity for innovation.  The first issue of concern to us is to feed Africa. We must substitute this idea of food aid  which was at the origin of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)  and replace it with the concept of assistance to agriculture  because we have demonstrated that we are able to carry out agriculture just like developed countries. Unfortunately  we suffer from certain shortages  including seeds  fertilizer and equipment  as I will show in a moment. In place of traditional financing  we need to imagine what is referred to now as innovative financing.   In June 2008  we raised an alarm over the increase in the price of basic commodities and especially of food products. The Secretary-General asked FAO to meet in Rome with heads of State. We dropped everything in order to go to Rome and respond to that appeal  believing that real solutions would be proposed. Solutions were proposed  but we are still waiting for them to be implemented. At the same time  I drew attention to the fact that the countries of the Sahel region have three to four months of rain each year  during which time one could grow whatever one wanted if one had the means to do so. That is followed by eight or nine months of drought.  We launched that appeal  but like the doctor who arrives after the death  no one responded. Fortunately for Senegal  we foresaw difficulties due to the weighty global mechanisms and launched a programme called the Great Agricultural Offensive for Agriculture and Abundance. We were told it was too ambitious because it amounted to $800 million.  The project  which began at the end of May  will be completed in a month. I have the pleasure to inform the Assembly that  beyond meeting its food needs  Senegal has met the challenge of achieving a surplus. Six months ago  Senegal was among the most food-dependent countries  importing all its food  including more than 600 000 tons of rice annually. But a look at Senegal today reveals that there is green everywhere. I called on all Senegalese everywhere  including in the Senegalese diaspora  to farm as much as they wanted — on 10  20 or 1 000 hectares — so long as it was food. That great offensive  as I have said  has unquestionably been a great success. The world will not see Senegal launching an appeal for food assistance. We have solved the problem and hope that we have solved it once and for all.   Admittedly  we could not have done it without God’s help. The programme required $100 million  a third of which was to be devoted to fertilizer. Fortunately  our country is endowed with phosphate deposits that can be directly used as fertilizer for crops  thus enabling us to save one third of the cost of our investment in the programme. This has been possible because of the belief I have adhered to for more than 50 years. I have said for a long time that we could find phosphate. We have now gone out to find that hidden wealth. As I said in jest about the previous regimes  God had hidden it from them  but we managed to find it.  Africa has responded to the call to protect the environment. President Obasanjo and I launched the Great Green Wall Initiative  whereby a band of trees 15 kilometres wide and 7 000 kilometres long will stretch from Dakar to Djibouti. Once again  we were told that it was a dream. No  as I speak  since  in the words of the philosopher  we believe in going forward by walking  Senegal is in the process of building 587 kilometres of the Great Green Wall. Everyone has supported us in this endeavour — France  the United States  the European Union — at least in words. We are looking forward to your support  especially from the scientists  who we hope will help us to choose drought-resistant plants. It is possible. I contacted scientists through the Internet. They came from all over the world — Europe  the United States  American universities and Australia. I accordingly called for the help now of the Science Without Borders association. I invited scientists to Senegal because their knowledge comes free of charge  and they are always willing to make it available for the benefit of humankind.   The Great Green Wall will be backed by what we call retention basins. Billions of tons of water that fall during the rainy season are lost to runoff or the sea. We are trying to capture that water  as is being done so well in countries such as Burkina Faso. We in Senegal are making that a systematic effort. The World Bank   27 08-51749  has labelled our effort conclusive  and we also want to build a green strip from Dakar to Djibouti.  Africa is therefore responding to the call of the international community to protect the environment. However  I cannot fail to point out that the African coast is in the process of disappearing  with several centimetres being lost from Morocco to the Gulf of Guinea each year. In that connection  a first meeting was held in Cotonou a few days ago to address the issue of coastal erosion.   As the Assembly is aware  the Secretary-General has issued a challenge to Africa. Not long ago  the World Bank indicated that five African countries were capable of achieving the Millennium Development Goals  including Senegal. The Secretary-General has said that no African country would achieve the Millennium Development Goals. I  for my part  respond to challenges. I shall meet that challenge for Senegal  I shall take it up  and that is not a dream. Not long ago  Senegal was very far down on the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business Index. Just a few days ago  thanks to our targeted efforts to overcome our shortcomings  Senegal was classified as the first country in Africa for doing business  and the fifth in the world.   Child and maternal mortality is one of the obstacles to overcoming our shortcomings. After giving thought to the problem  we decided a week ago in Senegal that  so long as the problem is left up to the State  we will not make progress. We have instituted a new approach that entails putting in charge a woman in each neighbourhood of the affected areas to monitor pregnancies and help pregnant women to visit doctors  as well as to immediately inform the authorities of any problems. We hope that will enable us to reduce child and maternal mortality. We are even going so far as to provide cell phones to women in the interior of Senegal so that they can report cases to health-care centres.  There is also a need to establish a new mechanism to mobilize resources. That was our goal in setting up a pilot group for solidarity levies to fund development. We have also launched a digital solidarity fund. We Africans have done that  with the support of the entire world. We are therefore on our way to bridging the digital divide identified by the Secretary-General.  As we begin our work here  more than 1 billion Muslims throughout the world are fasting in accordance with one of Islam’s five pillars. Apart from religion  for every Muslim the fast is a code of behaviour inspired by the lofty values of peace  sharing  forgiveness  respect and brotherly love  irrespective of religion. On the basis of the letter and spirit of the message of Islam  which are being celebrated during this Holy month of Ramadan  and in my capacity as Chairman-in-Office of the Organization of the Islamic Conference  I should like here to reiterate the adherence of the Islamic Umma to the principles of the culture of peace and dialogue among civilizations. We affirm that we condemn extremism  violence  intolerance and discrimination  which are contrary to the teachings of Islam and which our religion condemns as a source of unhappiness and discord. It is for that reason that we are willing to engage in a dialogue with all civilizations.   The United Nations ideal of peace continues to be tested by the reality of conflicts in the world. Although we have certainly seen fewer trouble spots in Africa  conflict still rages in Chad  the Sudan and Darfur. We  for our part  will always continue to give our active support to peace and the United Nations.  Quite sincerely  however  I believe that there will be no solution in Darfur until we disarm all armed groups  which have been clearly identified. As for Zimbabwe  we welcome the progress that is being made. In Mauritania  we  as a neighbouring country  are very concerned about what is taking place. But I should like to reiterate here that we very much believe in the rule of law of the Republic  in accordance with the position outlined by the African Union.   We are also continuing our efforts in the Middle East  as we have been called on to give our support to intra-Palestinian dialogue and to dialogue between Israel and Palestine.  For many years now  I have consistently bemoaned the ineffectiveness of economic thinking. The failure from which we are suffering today is the failure of economists and financiers and  more generally  of the intelligentsia. I greatly appreciate the appeal just made to the intelligentsia made by the President of the Dominican Republic.   I continue to believe that the solution to the crisis is not to be found in the North; crises begin in the North  but we will not find their solutions in the North.    08-51749 28   The global economy moved from Europe to the United States where it created a new centre of development that has underpinned the global economy for almost 200 years. Now that economy is running out of steam because of crises like the one we are facing today.   President Bush has told us about a solution advocated by his financiers  but I am sorry: the solution to the North’s crisis lies in the South; the solution lies in Africa.  Rather than allowing capital to roam in every direction to create inflationary situations  I think it better  as a Keynesian thinker  to call on Members to invest in the creation of wealth and jobs in Africa  a continent possessed of great material and human resources and capable of taking its turn as the engine of the exhausted global economy. That economy  which left Europe for the United States  will finally be developed in Africa.  That is why we call on the entire world to invest in Africa because it is there that I sincerely believe that the last advances will be achieved. It is true that some trouble spots remain — as in every country — but with the support of the General Assembly and the Secretary-General  and with all people of goodwill  we are sure that Africa will be able to play that role  provided of course that Africans are trained as soon as possible to assume that historic mission.  It is on this note of hope and as Vice-President of the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) and President-in-Office of the Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) that I make an appeal to all countries to continue supporting efforts for peace and continue supporting investment efforts in Africa."
"151",6193,"SGP",63,2008,"The collapse of the recent Doha talks is deeply troubling. The Doha Development Round was the first round of talks to be launched after the end of the cold war.  Two years after the failed start at Seattle  it was launched again two months after 11 September 2001  when member countries of the World Trade Organization (WTO) felt a strong sense of common cause. Since then  however  progress has been painfully difficult. I remember WTO Director-General Pascal Lamy telling me that not enough countries felt a sense of responsibility for the global trading system. The recent setback in Geneva means that it will be some time before the Doha Development Round can be concluded.  During the Cold War  the United States and the European Union effectively led the global trading system of the non-communist world. In 1994  the Uruguay Round was finally concluded after United States and European negotiators struck a bargain at Blair House  much to the unhappiness of many countries that felt excluded but went along nonetheless. For the Doha Development Agenda  however  a number of developing country members were determined that this should not happen again.     08-53135 10   Brazil played a leading role in forming the Group of Twenty (G-20) coalition of countries  including India and China. At the Cancún talks in September 2003  the G-20 became a grouping whose position could not be ignored  altering the traditional dynamics of multilateral trade negotiations. When the talks failed in July  it was apparently over the issues of agricultural safeguards for China and India  but even if a compromise over safeguards had been possible  United States cotton subsidies  which were next on the agenda  would still have been a major sticking point.  The failure of the Geneva talks comes at a time when the global economy is rapidly slowing down. Many of us worry that the downturn will be severe because of the collapse of huge asset bubbles inflated over many years by loose monetary policies. Protectionist pressures will now build up in many countries. A rise in trade protectionism could reduce global welfare by many billions of dollars. Our collective efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) have become much harder.  Who takes responsibility for the global trading system? Who takes responsibility for the global system? While on paper the 153 WTO members make decisions by consensus  the reality is that a small group of countries has to take the lead to keep the multilateral trading system moving in the right direction. On no major issue confronting the human family can decisions be taken without the major countries taking the lead. The challenge of climate change  for example  cannot be tackled without the major emitters coming to some broad agreement on the way forward. If the Doha Round  despite being a positive-sum game  is so difficult to conclude  it is hard to be optimistic that a United Nations agreement on climate change can be negotiated quickly without the exercise of strong leadership by the United States  Europe  Russia  China  India  Japan and Brazil. If they could not or would not exercise such leadership on global trade  can we expect them to do so on climate change?  The emerging multipolar reality of the twenty-first century is a fact that we have to face squarely. International institutions like the United Nations can only function well when we accept that reality and work with it. As a small country  Singapore accepts that while all countries  big or small  have a single vote each  we do not all carry the same weight. Small countries need the United Nations and other international institutions to protect our interests  and we therefore have every interest in making sure that those institutions are effective. They can work well only if the world’s multipolar reality is taken into account. The Forum of Small States  which is an informal grouping of more than half the United Nations membership  takes a realistic view of global politics because that is the only way to secure our own interests.  Recent developments in the Balkans and Caucasus do not bode well for the future. After the crimes committed against the Kosovar people in the 1990s  many countries expressed sympathy and supported some form of autonomy for them. However  Kosovo’s unilateral declaration of independence in February was greeted with a certain discomfort because of the precedent it set for other parts of the world. I remember Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) foreign ministers discussing Kosovo at our retreat in Singapore in February. While we supported autonomy for the Kosovar people  we felt it premature to recognize Kosovo’s independence at that point in time. There was strong preference for the issue to be resolved by the United Nations.  Russia’s recent recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia as independent States is also unsettling. Some analysts see it as Russia’s response to western support for Kosovo’s independence. While the issue of Kosovo and the disputes in South Ossetia and Abkhazia are different and should not be directly linked  we do have a common concern  which is the role of the United Nations in conferring legitimacy on new States. If this century is to be peaceful  it is crucial that all countries  big and small  abjure violence and adhere to the Charter of the United Nations and to the international rule of law.  The relaxation of tensions across the Taiwan Straits in the past few months serves as a positive example of how intractable problems from the past can be creatively transcended with wisdom  goodwill and patience. Sometimes impatience is its own worst enemy. After 90 years  the collapse of the Ottoman Empire has left some problems still unresolved in parts of its former domain. We cannot expect all the issues thrown up by the end of the cold war and the break-up of the Soviet Union to be quickly overcome. What we know is that  without the United Nations setting acceptable norms of behaviour  there will be many more problems in the world and some of the problems   11 08-53135  we now face will become far worse. Universally agreed human rights are important precisely because they underpin those norms of good behaviour.  However  the realpolitik of big Power rivalry cannot simply be wished away; indeed  it has been part of the human condition for most of our history. However  we can confine that rivalry and  by a combination of pressures  prevent any Power from pushing its claim excessively. International institutions like the United Nations play a civilizing role in such efforts. International institutions cannot stop big Power rivalry  but they can channel it and ensure that the common interests of the human family are not completely disregarded.  For that reason  the smaller countries have a strong vested interest in seeing international institutions strengthened. The reform of the United Nations to take into account the changes in the world since the end of the Second World War is an absolute necessity; so  too  is reform of the other Bretton Woods institutions. Either we reform them to forestall crises or we wait for crises to force change upon us. For example  if the present global economic downturn is the once-in-a-century event Alan Greenspan talked about  then bringing China and India into the Group of Eight and making the International Monetary Fund and World Bank more representative of the global economy today become matters of urgency.  We can also make international institutions more effective by partnership with regional institutions. Every region has its own distinctive characteristics which must be taken into account.  When Cyclone Nargis hit Myanmar in May  there was for many precious days a stand-off between the Myanmar Government and the international community over the provision of assistance. Western warships bearing relief supplies were viewed with suspicion by a Government that saw not the supplies but a military threat. It was absurd that such suspicions got in the way of soldiers helping cyclone victims in the Irrawaddy Delta. ASEAN had to step in and build a bridge of trust between the Myanmar Government and the international community. A tripartite organization involving the United Nations  ASEAN and the Myanmar Government worked effectively day by day to overcome problems on the ground and ensure that international aid reached the furthest corners of the affected area. That prevented a second wave of deaths from hunger or disease. ASEAN on its own did not have the capabilities to help Myanmar in a major way  but ASEAN working together with the United Nations and other international agencies was able to make a huge difference.   With globalization  there has been a mushrooming of regional institutions around the world. Some have come to play useful roles in fostering regional peace and development. The United Nations and other international agencies can multiply their effectiveness by working closely with such regional institutions.  While international and regional institutions can provide a more conducive environment  the key to a country’s development is its own good governance. Because every country has its own unique history  there is no universal model of development applicable to all countries. Every country must find its own road to the future.  At the closing of the Olympic Games in Beijing  the President of the International Olympic Committee  Jacques Rogge  described China’s hosting of the Games as truly exceptional. Indeed  from beginning to end  the organization was superb — from the spectacular opening ceremony to the hospitality extended to individual delegations. Everyone was impressed  and rightly so. That was a Chinese dream come true  and the world doffed its hat to the achievement of the Chinese people. Thirty years ago  all that would have been inconceivable  even to the Chinese themselves. What has changed? Good governance and the right policies in place have unleashed the natural talents of over a billion people.   India  with a different history and political system  is also making remarkable progress. Here again  the right policies  introduced less than 20 years ago  have made a profound difference. Indeed  across all of Asia  from the Bering Straits to the Gulf  an ancient continent  encompassing more than half the world’s population  is stirring again. Although highly diverse  the countries of Asia are being reconnected by a new East-West trade in a new age of globalization. To be sure  not all are doing well. Among those that are  and they are many  a recent report by the Commission on Growth and Development  chaired by Nobel laureate Michael Spence  identified effective government as a critical factor. In a surprising departure from Western conventional wisdom  the    08-53135 12  report did not see democracy as either a necessary or a sufficient condition  at least not in the initial phase of economic take-off.  That is an important insight which can help the work of international and regional institutions in promoting national development. If we set as our objective the promotion of democracy  the reaction among many countries will instinctively be negative. However  if we set as our objective the promotion of effective government  our task will be much easier. Let each country  after having achieved a certain level of development  then evolve the form of democracy best suited to its culture and history. In a recent speech  President of the World Bank Robert Zoellick hit it on the head when he emphasized that the strategic centre of gravity is to build legitimacy through good and effective governance.  However  for development to take place  there must be peace. Without continuing peace in Asia  we will not be able to realize the promise of this century. The thoughtful manner in which the United States is managing its strategic relationship with a rising China and India is of decisive importance. It is rare in history for new Powers to emerge without conflict. China and India are becoming responsible stakeholders in the global system. That many of the sons and daughters of Chinese and Indian leaders choose to study in American universities gives us reason to be cautiously optimistic about the future of Asia.  We cannot stop rivalry among the big Powers  but we can limit the harm that rivalry does to smaller countries. In fact  smaller countries can turn the emerging multipolarity to advantage if we combine our strengths in regional and international institutions. Among those  the most important is  of course  the United Nations.  We still need global leadership  but it has to be by a new concert of big Powers going beyond the United States  Europe and Japan. It has to be a new kind of leadership exercised in a transparent manner through both hard and soft power  and preferably through regional and international institutions. Writing about the Beijing Olympics in The Wall Street Journal on 26 August  Tony Blair said: “The truth is that nothing in the twenty-first century will work well without China’s full engagement”. The same can be said of Russia  India and Brazil. While the United States will long remain dominant  a more inclusive global arrangement will make this a better and safer world for all of us. "
"152",6226,"SLB",63,2008,"At the outset  Sir  allow me to offer the warm and sincere congratulations of Solomon Islands on your election as President of the Assembly at its sixty-third session. I am confident that with your vast experience and able leadership you will guide this session to a fruitful outcome. You can rest assured of Solomon Islands unwavering support and cooperation during your tenure of office.  Through you  I acknowledge the good work of your predecessor  Mr. Srgjan Kerim  who has shown great leadership on issues of global concern  in particular on climate change  financing for development  United Nations reform and the Millennium Development Goals.   My delegation is pleased to see you  Mr. President  take such issues head on  presiding over the high-level event on the Millennium Development Goals as we arrive at the midpoint of our time-bound commitments. Unfortunately  many countries  including my own  are off track in terms of achieving the Goals.  My delegation also wishes to join others in conveying its gratitude and appreciation to our Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  who has worked tirelessly and diligently to protect and preserve the principles and purposes of the Charter during his first year in office. We wish him well as he carries on the good work he has begun — in particular  his regular briefings of the membership  making his office accountable and transparent in carrying out its activities.  This year our multilateral institution is being revisited by history and challenged by the changing international system. Unilateralism and changing postures by big Powers are creating a new global order. The creation of new fronts in Asia  the Pacific and Eastern Europe is coupled with the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and parts of Africa. Above all  the arms race is no longer a threat  but a reality.  The structural imbalances of the international financial architecture have exposed the inability of the major developed markets to respond to the volatility of the international financial system  resulting in State interventions. The world economy is looking more precarious and unequal. For small open economies the results are catastrophic. Hence  we must be cautious in using the free market approach and recognize its limitations.  The increasing cost of food and energy is causing macroeconomic instability throughout the world today. This speaks of the complexity and weakness of the international system. It reflects the uneven distribution of wealth that continues to fail the developing countries  generating instability across the world. This can only be corrected by having an open rule-based  non-discriminatory and equitable trading system.   Furthermore  market speculation and agricultural subsidies continue to pose major risks to the global economy. The failure of the recent Doha Round is of concern to my delegation  as it further marginalizes the small economies from globalization. The issue of the food crisis now deserves our immediate and most serious consideration at this session.  My delegation deeply regrets that the recently discussed United Nations food crisis Comprehensive Action Plan is not matched by the required resources.   5 08-52265  Countries will therefore need to look at their own resources for solutions. To this end  Solomon Islands is working on short-  medium- and long-term solutions. The population is encouraged to eat locally produced food and to undertake community-based rice growing programmes. Solomon Islands hopes to further strengthen its relations with rice-growing countries. My Government commends the Republic of China on Taiwan for supporting Solomon Islands rice-growing programmes.  Dependency on imported fossil fuel and food is reversing Millennium Development Goals gains  painstakingly achieved over the last decades. Solomon Islands is no exception. Thus  cleaner energy to power the world economy is the way forward. In this connection  we look to both the North and the South for solutions. I wish to thank the Republic of China on Taiwan  Turkey  Italy and Austria for coming forward with community-based renewable energy programmes. Such cooperation preserves the indispensable character of our noble institution and translates into action the Solomon Islands rural electrification policy of bringing affordable electricity to 80 per cent of its population in the rural areas.   We are also exploring bulk purchasing arrangements with Venezuela  using the models of the Petro Carribe arrangement. We hope  having spent a third of our national budget on fuel alone  that this will provide Solomon Islands with some breathing space.  Climate change and natural disasters continue to create anxiety and cast a dark cloud over the future and survival of humanity  in particular of the 50 million people of small island developing States. The magnitude of climate change has outgrown the existing capacity of the United Nations system. Our multilateral institution is heavy on providing technical support and analytical data and less weighty with regard to on-the-ground activities. Regional and subregional intergovernmental organizations are also going in the same direction  leaving countries to fend for themselves. Solomon Islands hopes that the Small Island Developing States Unit within the United Nations will be strengthened to effectively coordinate implementation of meeting the special needs of small island developing States.  Today there is already within Solomon Islands a steady migratory pattern of movements of indigenous populations from their ancestral low islands to larger islands as sea levels rise. This has placed much stress on the diverse fragile land tenure system  causing friction between ethnic groups. Climate change is for Solomon Islands a sustainable development  security and poverty issue — all are interlinked. It is about preserving our forests  about our reforestation programme and about providing environment-friendly opportunities for the resources owners in our rural areas.  On this note  Solomon Islands is embarking on an ambitious programme of scaling down logging  which is the country’s major export income-earner. My Government has earmarked funds for community-based reafforestation and reforestation programmes. It is hoped that over time the agriculture  tourism and fisheries industries will fill the forestry vacuum within the country’s economy  and that sustainable harvest of forests will become the norm.  The increased frequency and magnitude of natural disasters remind us that no country will be spared. Solomon Islands is still recovering from last year’s tsunami. We feel the pain and suffering of the Governments and peoples of Myanmar and the People’s Republic of China  hit by Cyclone Nargis and earthquake respectively.   More recently the three hurricanes that battered our fellow islanders in the Caribbean speak of our common vulnerability to natural disasters.   My delegation hopes that a more committed outcome will emerge from the Bali Action Plan.   Solomon Islands further notes with concern the proliferation of climate change financial mechanisms outside the multilateral process. This will once again disadvantage the most vulnerable countries — small island developing States and least developed countries. Climate change for us requires new and additional resources. Accessibility to the Adaptation Fund and funds for mitigation and technology transfer are at the heart of the solutions to climate change challenges.  In this light  Solomon Islands fully associates itself with the Alliance of Small Island States Declaration on the issue  as well as the recently adopted Pacific Islands Forum Leaders’ Niue Declaration on Climate Change. We further call on the United Nations membership to support the draft resolution on climate change and security.    08-52265 6   On the issue of terrorism  Solomon Islands is concerned about the lack of progress on the draft comprehensive terrorism convention. The absence of a legal definition of terrorism is creating gaps in our global fight against terror. We continue to condemn terrorism in whatever form and manifestation. We urge the international community to weed out the evils that breed terrorism. Our fight against terrorism must be responsible and humane.  I take this opportunity to sincerely congratulate the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands  commonly referred to as RAMSI. The Government and people of Solomon Islands value its partnership with the Regional Mission  and I thank all participating Pacific Islands Forum Countries for their ongoing contribution and commitment. RAMSI continues to enjoy popular support  as it provides a unique opportunity and an enabling environment to rebuild Solomon Islands. Since assuming office nine months ago  my Government  the Coalition for National Unity and Rural Advancement  has defined its relationship with RAMSI and the Pacific Islands Forum through consultation and dialogue. This is done through regional and national processes.  Solomon Islands and RAMSI will soon commence negotiations on a proposed Government-RAMSI partnership framework  which will form the basis of future cooperation. The guiding principles of the framework are that it should be people-centred  nationally owned and driven and aligned to Government priorities and policies. This should guarantee its sustainability and long-term success.  Meanwhile  our Parliamentary Foreign Relations Committee has been mandated by our National Parliament to review RAMSI. The Committee is expected to report its findings to Parliament next year.  Solomon Islands is establishing a Truth and Reconciliation Commission  modelled on South Africa’s experience  to address people’s traumatic experience during the three years of ethnic conflict. It is our hope that the process will rebuild confidence  trust and unity among the diverse cultural communities in Solomon Islands.  More than 80 per cent of the country’s resources and land are traditionally owned. Last month the Solomon Islands National Parliament passed a Secured Transactions Bill  which will make traditional assets bankable to allow more investment in the informal sector. Solomon Islands is also considering putting in place a Political Parties Integrity Bill to instil national stability and nurture its growing democracy.  On the issue of achieving the Millennium Development Goals  as a small island developing State with least developed country status  we find that much of our achievement rests on partnership with all stakeholders at all levels. Solomon Islands is one of the highest foreign aid recipient countries. This unfortunately has overstretched and crowded our national policy space in strengthening and maintaining good relations with all donors. Meanwhile  the Government welcomes new approaches by non-traditional donors of providing direct assistance using existing national institutional frameworks. This strengthens governance and democracy  as provided for under the Paris Declaration  allowing the State to increase its legitimacy and reach out to its population more meaningfully.  My delegation remains concerned that much of the debate on the Millennium Development Goals is centred on social commitments  from health to gender and from HIV/AIDS to education. Economic issues are given no attention  placing countries with huge youth and unemployed populations in an awkward and fragile situation. We consider such a gap as a time bomb that will explode and trigger more instability in the future if it remains unaddressed.   Educating our youth is the way forward. We are therefore grateful to those countries that continue to train our young people. This year a new partner  Cuba  is offering medical training opportunities for more than 60 students. Solomon Islands will make every effort to utilize these training opportunities.  Within my subregion of the Pacific  the Melanesian Spearhead Group  after some 20 years of informal existence  has established a secretariat  located in Vanuatu. This should further strengthen relations among the subregion’s countries and its wider neighbours  as we continue to address our collective development aspirations.  We have only eight months left to register our continental shelf  as required by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. We are working diligently on the matter  having just accessed the Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea Trust Fund four months ago. Solomon Islands welcomes the recent decision by the eighteenth   7 08-52265  Meeting of States Parties to the Convention recognizing the technical and resources constraints on many developing countries in meeting the required time frame of May 2009. We are determined to keep working on this very important issue  which will redefine our territorial waters.  I turn to sustainable development issues. Hailing from the world’s largest ocean  countries of the Pacific have relied on the ocean for their livelihood and economic sustenance. This has prompted certain countries of the Pacific  including Solomon Islands  to initiate sustainable management arrangements to protect our juvenile tuna stocks by closing pockets of high seas adjacent to our respective exclusive economic zones.  The review of the implementation of the Monterrey Consensus scheduled for late this year should promote global growth and better international development support  especially for the least developed countries which remain on the periphery of the international system. Solomon Islands hopes the review will also reinvigorate the operations and governance of the Bretton Woods institutions  to make them more responsive to the changing character of the international financial system and become an effective part of the multilateral system.  As one of the least developed countries  Solomon Islands looks forward to the Fourth United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries  scheduled for 2010  which will provide an opportunity to address the special challenges of the least developed countries. My delegation joins other least developed countries in looking to you  Mr. President  for leadership to work on the modalities of the conference during this session.  On the issue of democratization of the United Nations  Solomon Islands believes that our Organization must play a prominent role in influencing and shaping the dynamics of the international system. This can be achieved only by increasing the legitimacy of our premier Organization through wider participation of its membership. This means that strengthening the General Assembly is crucial. Ensuring that the Secretariat is representative of the membership is a must.   We also call for a genuine attempt by the Secretariat to undertake a universal recruitment drive  in particular among those that remain underrepresented in the Organization. This could be achieved through annual country competitive recruitment exams. Solomon Islands welcomes the recent recruitment exams held in Honiara  and would like to see them held annually.  On the issue of system-wide coherence  Solomon Islands notes the establishment five months ago of the joint office arrangement between the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)  the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF). Having one of the largest UNDP country programmes in the subregion of the Pacific  we note with concern that more than 70 per cent to 80 per cent of the programmes are spent on consultancy  making country-United Nations relations distant.   In this regard  my delegation welcomes the appointment of an in-country UNDP Deputy Resident Representative. However  we renew our call for a fully fledged in-country Resident Representative.  Security Council reform continues to elude the Organization. It is like a process that has never started and takes the longest to finish. We have over the years identified elements for negotiations  yet remain reluctant to move into intergovernmental negotiations. I am confident that you will give us leadership  Mr. President  and plough deep in facilitating an intergovernmental process on Security Council reform by February 2009. In this connection  Solomon Islands reiterates its support for Japan  Brazil and India as permanent members in an enlarged Security Council.  On the issue of Taiwan  Solomon Islands congratulates the Government and people of Taiwan on the successful free and fair election of President Ma Ying-jeou in March this year. My delegation acknowledges the goodwill shown by Taiwan in developing an atmosphere of trust  flexibility  pragmatism and a positive spirit to reduce tension across the Taiwan Strait with greater economic engagement through trade  tourism and cultural exchange.   We also note the intention to replace armed confrontation with negotiation  and isolation with engagement. Resumption of direct flights between the two countries  increased dialogue  and people-to-people interaction are all positive developments that should be encouraged. Above all  much has happened since the March election.    08-52265 8   Solomon Islands calls on the international community to recognize the Republic of China on Taiwan’s good faith and build on the positive momentum. The international community must provide the Republic of China on Taiwan with the necessary and appropriate international space if we are to be responsible and contribute to the maintenance of international peace  stability and security along the Taiwan Strait.  Solomon Islands welcomes the 47-day Annapolis talks held from December 2007 into January this year. My delegation shares the Quartet’s support for ongoing Palestine and Israel negotiations to realize the shared goal of establishing a Palestine State by December 2008 as a just  permanent and long-lasting solution to the Middle East conflict.   Solomon Islands further salutes Turkey for mediating talks between Israel and Syria in April  and salutes the courage of the two countries in discussing issues that are difficult and sensitive.  In conclusion  as we reflect on the range of the global agenda before us  we must honour and act on our collective commitments. We must also define a path that offers our people human security guaranteeing freedom from want  freedom from fear and freedom to live in human dignity. "
"153",6272,"SLE",63,2008,"It is an honour for me  as President of the Republic of Sierra Leone  to deliver my first speech to this Assembly. I wish to congratulate Mr. D’Escoto Brockmann on his assumption of the high office of President of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session  and to assure him of Sierra Leone’s support and cooperation as he undertakes the challenging responsibility of presiding over our deliberations during this session. I should also like to express my gratitude to his predecessor for the efficient way in which he guided the Assembly during its last session.  The sacred duty of this Organization to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war was tested in fire in Sierra Leone  but today my country demonstrates what the United Nations can achieve when its Members work closely together. The people of Sierra Leone know the value and relevance of the United Nations and appreciate its continuing support as we reconstruct our society from war to peace and work with determination to build a better future.   25 08-51845   The theme for this general debate  “The impact of the global food crisis on poverty and hunger in the world as well as the need to democratize the United Nations”  is important and timely. Africa has a disproportionate share of the world’s poor and hungry  and the need for urgent and concerted action is compelling. The rising cost of food has had a negative impact on our resources and poses a threat to our national stability and the stability of other countries in West Africa. It is vital that Africa increase food productivity and achieve food self-sufficiency. African farmers need to adopt higher-yielding land practices  with increased use of seeds  fertilizers and irrigation.  In that connection  we welcome the work of the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa  chaired by former Secretary-General Kofi Annan. The Alliance recognizes that massive investment in agriculture is the key to a long-term solution to the continent’s food crisis. That will enable Africans to grow enough of their own food and become less dependent on handouts from donors. Sierra Leone  like many other countries in Africa  is suitably positioned to benefit from such investment because of its vast arable land  abundant water resources and the fact that over 70 per cent of its population is engaged in farming or farming-related activities. If that problem is going to be resolved  it is essential to end the agricultural subsidies and trade barriers that impoverish African farmers.  I have had the privilege to coordinate the African Union committee of 10 heads of State and Government charged with the mandate to promote the African Common Position on the Reform of the United Nations. In that capacity  and as Head of State of Sierra Leone  I welcome the theme “the need to democratize the United Nations” as part of this year’s work of the General Assembly.  The need to democratize and reform the Organization is of vital importance. However  reform is not an end in itself but a means to an end. We support a strong and effective United Nations that can meet the ever-increasing and complex array of challenges in the twenty-first century. We are convinced that a more representative and effective United Nations will strengthen the loyalty and commitment of Member States and make the Organization more responsive to the needs of our time.  It should be recognized that reform efforts have achieved some modest successes. However  one of the most critical and urgent issues on our current reform agenda — reform of the Security Council — remains unresolved. We need to make the Security Council more representative of today’s realities. The current composition of the Security Council contradicts basic principles of democratic representation. Africa has outlined its collective position in the Ezulwini Consensus. Africa will negotiate in good faith  and we expect others to do the same in the best interest of the Organization. The status quo is not an option. Africa  with 53 countries constituting about a quarter of the United Nations membership  deserves permanent representation in the Security Council. We believe that the Security Council should be enlarged sooner rather than later.  The United Nations has had an important role in global peace and the development of justice. Sierra Leone’s peace and stability are due largely to United Nations peacekeeping  a visible and an important aspect of the Organization’s work. The Peacebuilding Commission  the Peacebuilding Fund and other United Nations agencies are helping us in critical ways to achieve our development priorities and to meet the challenges of post-conflict reconstruction.  The United Nations-backed Special Court for Sierra Leone and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission have made extraordinary contributions to establishing the rule of law and fighting against impunity so that the people of Sierra Leone can put their tragic past behind them and look forward to the future. Without reconciliation  tolerance and the rule of law  there will be no true and lasting peace.  The Special Court has established legal principles that will endure beyond its anticipated closure in 2010. I want to commend the efforts of the Special Court to engage both my Government and the international justice community in making preparations for any residual issues that might remain following its closure. The facilities of the Special Court in the heart of our historic capital  Freetown  will be inherited by Sierra Leone  and we will explore the best possible use for them.  In recent years  Sierra Leone has made real progress in consolidating democracy and good governance by conducting successive free  fair and non-violent presidential  parliamentary and local Government elections. We are on the right path. On behalf of all Sierra Leoneans  I would like to thank    08-51845 26  members of the international community for their invaluable contribution to our electoral process  and particularly for their logistical and technical support that enabled the various institutions to perform their respective tasks.  But we are the first to acknowledge that much more needs to be done to achieve sustainable peace and development. War and deadly conflicts have social and economic consequences long after the fighting has ended. A peaceful country requires more than the absence of war. Development remains the foremost need of all Sierra Leoneans. Moreover  it is the foundation of security  and it makes political rights meaningful.   One can be secure only if one has food  shelter  clean water and protection from disease. That is why the monumental task of poverty eradication is one of the national priorities of my Government. My Government is completing a second-generation poverty reduction strategy to guide us in the process. We have also developed a comprehensive strategy for the nation’s development over the next five years  called the Agenda for Change. The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) are also central to our work. Despite the enormous difficulties on the development front and in achieving the MDGs  we are resolved to improve the lives of our people and to respond constructively to their needs and aspirations. International support remains crucial  however  if we are to consolidate hard-won gains. It is our hope that the United Nations and other development partners will continue to be our steadfast allies in our ongoing struggle for economic progress and development.  The mission of the United Nations — to serve the cause of peace  to advance development and to protect the human rights of all — is more important than ever. The United Nations is a unique forum where the weak and the strong  the poor and the prosperous can have their voices heard. Sierra Leone reaffirms its commitment to the ideals and principles of the United Nations and will continue to be a constructive partner and member of this Organization. "
"154",6319,"SLV",63,2008,"First of all  I have the pleasure of congratulating you  Sir  on being elected to preside over this session  an honour falling to a Central American for the second time in the history of the United Nations. I wish you every success and commend you once again. I would also like to express our gratitude for the work done by Mr. Kerim as President of the previous session. On behalf of El Salvador  I would also like to congratulate the Secretary-General for the dynamism and determination with which he is leading the Organization.   It seems to me very timely that the central focus of debate for this session is the impact of the global food crisis on the issue of poverty and hunger throughout the world  including the need to democratize the United Nations. It is increasingly evident every day that the world is facing a global crisis that has a negative impact on development efforts  especially in the poorest countries. Food  climate  energy and financial problems are aggravating the already difficult situation of developing countries.    08-51839 22  We are gathered here because we have a duty to assume the political and moral responsibility to respond to the problems currently facing the international community. The world must learn from both its successes and its failures. We must learn to face crises collectively and turn them into opportunities  for no one can solve them alone any longer.   In order to preserve the progress made in the area of development  we need to strengthen global leadership to make it both decisive and accountable. In the current crisis  there is a danger that we could lose ground.   The economic and financial system cannot be at the mercy of markets that operate on speculation. Together  we must rebuild a wise capitalist system that provides financing for economic development  rather than one that rewards speculation.   We must help to prevent and mitigate serious financial fluctuations. We must balance accounts and stabilize credit. I agree with the President of the French Republic that  in order to achieve this  countries directly affected by the situation must meet as soon as possible to find joint solutions to what is the most acute financial crisis the world has experienced in 75 years.   It is undeniable the rise — and above all the instability — in the price of oil continues to have a negative impact on development efforts in most countries in the world  in particular the smallest and most vulnerable among them.  Here  I would like to reiterate the call I made from this very rostrum last year (see A/62/PV.6)  for oil-producing countries to seek and implement flexible mechanisms aimed at ensuring that hydrocarbon prices do not continue to drastically affect developing countries. Such mechanisms  of course  should not ignore the harmful effects of speculation by intermediaries in the world markets.   If we do not act jointly and immediately  and if  in this forum  we are not able to come up with a balanced solution to this problem  we will effectively condemn oil-importing countries to bankruptcy for years to come. We have invested in development  and we have worked as hard as possible to achieve the MDGs; those successes will be swept aside by the excessive and crippling prices of oil. We cannot continue to wait. We must take immediate political decisions to shore up development and prevent a deeper crisis in order to preserve global peace  security and stability.   Faced with the food crisis  which is directly affecting us all  we support the implementation of the measures agreed upon during the June 2008 High-Level Conference on World Food Security: the Challenges of Climate Change and Bioenergy. We call for action and assistance  particularly for affected developing countries.   We would like to congratulate the Group of Eight (G8) on its decision to support  in the framework of the United Nations system  the establishment of a world agriculture and food association  and the identification of a range of actions to address the food crisis  including through the participation of major institutions.  In the face of this tangle of problems that require creative responses  the countries of the Central American Integration System (SICA) advocate the initiative on action under the Staple Grains Plan  which concentrates in particular on strengthening technical assistance and public and private assistance and a programme for financing  land leasing and a temporary worker programme.  The countries of SICA and Brazil  during El Salvador’s pro tempore presidency of that organization  supported the holding of a special session of the General Assembly on the world food and energy crisis. As a result  a high-level meeting on food security was held  beginning on 18 July  in this very Hall  during which El Salvador explained the actions that we have undertaken in order to deal with the crisis in Central America  particularly in the most vulnerable areas.   In our country  El Salvador  we are responding with social programmes aimed at reducing extreme poverty  fighting hunger and infant malnutrition  and attaining other MDGs. At the next Ibero-American summit of heads of State or Government  which will be held in El Salvador  the subject of children under the age of five will be a matter of priority.  In order to counter the impact of the economic crisis on Salvadoranian households  we have created a multidisciplinary commission with broad participation  which has proposed a series of measures to address   23 08-51839  current effects and promote a social pact of national solidarity for productivity and employment. Those solutions involve business people  workers  political parties and civil society bodies  and the creation of a committee for the implementation of viable priority actions.  One of the most successful measures that we have implemented in El Salvador to prevent a food crisis is the promotion of improved seed varieties for staple grains  which has enabled us to achieve record production this year.   However  I have to tell the Assembly that all the efforts of solidarity we make as a global forum or as individual countries require broad participation  democratic stability  the enjoyment of full individual liberties  and a genuine sense of social responsibility on the part of Governments  irrespective of their ideologies. International cooperation is also important for strengthening national and regional efforts. That is why El Salvador has insisted on the issue of cooperation with middle-income countries.   In October 2007  at San Salvador  we held the second International Conference on Development Cooperation with Middle-Income Countries. In August 2008  in Namibia  my country co-chaired the third Conference on that subject. At that meeting  we agreed on measures including improving access to markets  reducing poverty  fulfilling the MDGs  increasing the competitiveness of our economies and improving our physical and financial infrastructures.   The problems we face require decisive measures to be taken. In that respect  I would ask all Member States to support the fulfilment and implementation of the commitments agreed upon in the El Salvador Consensus and the Namibia Declaration  as well as the consideration of this topic at the Global Conference on Financing for Development in Doha. Those efforts should lead to a General Assembly resolution with the objective of reviewing current practices in the area of international cooperation.  For middle-income countries  injustice is clearly to be seen in international cooperation. The commitment I propose should lead us to swiftly prepare a multidisciplinary plan of action  global in its scope  in order to strengthen development cooperation for middle-income countries. We believe that new types of development cooperation must also be included  such as South-South cooperation  triangular cooperation  the exchange of debt for investment in social areas  such as health  education and the environment  as we are already doing with Spain  France and Germany. All of this could help us to attain all of the MDGs and to meet other parameters established by the United Nations.   In my view  it is important that as we seek solutions to all of those problems  we never abandon our ongoing efforts to achieve the MDGs. In that respect  I am very happy to describe some of the achievements we made during the period from 2001 to 2007.   Extreme poverty at the national level was reduced from 32.6 per cent in 2001 to 12.8 per cent in 2007. With regard to education  the net rate of school enrolment increased from 78 to 93 per cent during that same period. The percentage of schoolchildren who enter the first grade of primary school and complete the fifth grade has increased from 58 to 80 per cent  and the literacy rate for young people between the ages of 15 and 24 has increased from 85 to 95 per cent. I would also like to inform you that the Constitution of El Salvador stipulates that primary education must be free. With tremendous effort  our Government has achieved and established free secondary education in all El Salvador’s public education institutions.  With regard to environmental sustainability  the percentage of the population without access to drinking water dropped from 23.9 to 12.1 per cent and without access to sanitation from 21.9 to 8.1 per cent.   In the fight against HIV/AIDS  I am very pleased to report on the major efforts that we have undertaken in El Salvador to help those suffering from HIV/AIDS — first and foremost  universal free antiretroviral drugs for all those who need them  with a great number of decentralized hospitals providing that treatment. In the last four years  we have managed to reduce the mortality rate of those with HIV/AIDS by 35 per cent and the number of children born with HIV/AIDS by 89.14 per cent  falling from 150 to 15 children annually.   With regard to implementing the goals of the Special Session of the General Assembly on Children in 2002  contained in the Plan of Action Creating a World Fit for Children (A/S-27/19/Rev.1)  I am pleased to report the progress El Salvador has made. We have achieved 15 of the 35 goals  particularly in the reduction of extreme poverty  immunization  infant and    08-51839 24  maternal mortality and education of children and adolescents.  Programmes such as the Solidarity Network  which maps poverty in order to identify extreme poverty  Alliance with the Family with 19 measures to help the family purse  Solidarity Fund for Health and healthy schools have been key to those successes. I must underline that we have achieved some of the targets established under the Millennium Development Goals before the 2015 deadline  in particular concerning poverty reduction  gender equality and access to drinking water. That is why we support the initiative of the Secretary-General to hold a summit in 2010 to review the progress made in implementing the Goals.   With regard to existing regional asymmetries  and even more those between developed and underdeveloped countries  and the role the United Nations should play regarding sustainable development  the Member States need a modern  strong global Organization with institutions able effectively to face the new challenges of the current international situation.  To that end  El Salvador would like to reiterate its resolute support for the United Nations reform process  so that the purposes and principles for which the Organization was created in 1945 can be fulfilled  particularly today when we are facing global threats against peace  security  human rights and international cooperation — fundamental pillars of development.  Security Council reform is particularly important as part of that effort  and in that respect  we would like to stress the need to bring changes to make that institution more representative  democratic and transparent  so as to adapt it to the current international situation.  From this rostrum  I should like to reiterate once again our profound appreciation to the United Nations system for supporting the process of coordinating and reinforcing the peace agreements in El Salvador. Today  El Salvador is a model. We are living witnesses of the fundamental role of the United Nations in guaranteeing peace and stability.   Mindful of our experience  El Salvador is participating actively as Vice-Chair of the Peacebuilding Commission. Similarly  we have become a troop-contributing country within the United Nations system  a role that we are proud to assume to defend world peace and security in times of need. On that basis  we have participated and continue to take part in operations in Côte d’Ivoire  Western Sahara  Liberia  Iraq and Haiti  and recently  we joined the Spanish contingent in the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon.  Migration  particularly when undocumented  has increasingly become a source of differences  instability and conflict. As a country of origin  transit and destination for migratory flows  we appeal for the continued strengthening of actions to combat and prevent the illegal trafficking of migrants and trade in persons in all their forms and for guaranteeing full protection and support for the victims of those crimes  particularly women and children.  While respecting the sovereign rights of States with regard to their immigration policies  we call for a comprehensive approach to international migration that values the positive contributions made by immigrants to the economy and culture of the communities where they live  and favours schemes in support of controlled migration  including temporary work programmes. I should like to point out that  in the United States alone  around 12 million undocumented migrants reside  awaiting humane and comprehensive immigration reform. They are good  hard-working people  who have sacrificed their lives to support their families.  Another subject on which we must try to achieve consensus is climate change and global warming. I would like to stress that our country is meeting its commitment to support international efforts to address the effects of climate change.  In that regard  El Salvador is actively participating in the international negotiations aimed at creating an instrument that will complement the Kyoto Protocol on the emission of greenhouse gases after 2012  and awaits the and successful conclusion of those negotiations in 2009 at the conference in Copenhagen  Denmark.   In the context of Central America  on 28 May 2008  the Presidents of the countries in the region adopted  at the invitation of my colleague and friend President Manuel José Zelaya Rosales of Honduras  the Declaration of San Pedro Sula on climate change and the environment  which set out guidelines for tackling the serious problems arising from climate change. In El Salvador  recently we launched the innovative   25 08-51839  project Green Network  which seeks to involve Government and private institutions and the Ministries of the Environment and of Education in the protection of the environment through the implementation of programmes to improve social and environmental conditions for the most vulnerable.  That initiative has encouraged participation in areas such as water security  judicious use of timber to protect the forests  recycling in schools  energy saving and responsible environmental business policies.  As the emissary of a nation that lives in democracy and peace  respecting human rights and fundamental freedoms  I should like to reiterate once again  on behalf of El Salvador  our firm support for the aspirations of the people of the Republic of China in Taiwan to participate in the international institutional structure  particularly in the United Nations system. We support the initiative to examine the participation of that country in the specialized agencies of the United Nations  with particular emphasis on the fact that the people of that country cannot and should not remain isolated from the international community and could contribute experience  resources and knowledge to deal with the challenges that we all face.  I also wish to refer to the case of Palestine. Palestine should have its own State  as does Israel  with secure borders. I think that the United Nations should play a greater and more active role in ensuring that the Palestinian people have their own territory and that the territory of Israel is also respected through secure borders.  This is the fifth time during my administration that the Government of El Salvador has been represented at the highest level in this important forum  which is the universal and most democratic body in our Organization. My presence in the General Assembly and in other high-level meetings to discuss matters of global interest constitutes an unequivocal demonstration of the importance and relevance we all attach to the work of the United Nations.  I would like to finalize my intervention as the President of El Salvador in this forum. I hope that the Organization will be strengthened on the basis of understanding  solidarity and the political will of all of its Members. I am absolutely convinced that if we combine our wills  our abilities and our resources  we will be able to steer the United Nations so that it may effectively fulfil its role of promoting peace  security  justice and sustainable development.  Despite the problems in the world  I am an eternal optimist. Problems always have solutions  and it is easier to find those solutions together. We must promote tolerance and human dignity. There is no greater bastion for peace and brotherhood than understanding and respect for our diversity  our beliefs and our fundamental values  if we are to live together peacefully and with solidarity between nations.   I also wish to state today  within this global forum  that the Central America of 20 years ago has disappeared  that the world’s image of it is mistaken. The Central American countries and the Central American Integration System — SICA — are working well. Integration is accelerating. Over the last three years we have made more progress in Central American integration than we have made over the last fifty years.   Central America has taken valiant  bold decisions  among them the customs union. Guatemala  El Salvador and Honduras will be making progress in the next few weeks in the area of customs — free movement of people and goods in a Central America of 40 million people living in an atmosphere of peace and tranquility  with the normal problems of any country  but with many exchanges and closer contacts between leaders.  Thanks to all  and may the supreme Creator guide us towards those great goals. May God bless our Organization  the whole world and Central America  and may God bless the Earth to which El Salvador belongs. "
"155",6344,"SMR",63,2008,"On behalf of the Government and the people of the Republic of San Marino  I wish to congratulate Mr. d’Escoto Brockmann on his appointment as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session. Please rest assured that the Republic of San Marino is eager to offer all its support for the success of this session.    08-51851 42   I would like to express our appreciation for the excellent work carried out during the sixty-second session of the General Assembly by the outgoing President  Mr. Srgjan Kerim  in particular for the commitment and determination he demonstrated while presiding over the Assembly and promoting the United Nations reform agenda.  I would also like to give special thanks to the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  for the great energy and dedication he has displayed in leading this Organization and  in particular  for his admirable commitment to the United Nations reform agenda and his continuing vigilance and determination in the face of emergencies and events of international political importance.  Furthermore  I would like to express San Marino’s appreciation for the consideration the Secretary-General has shown to all United Nations Member States  without distinction  including small States  and for the attention he has paid to particularly delicate and urgent issues  such as climate change and the global food crisis.  The United Nations reform process is of fundamental importance to world equilibrium and must remain the focus of our efforts. We must not allow our failure to reach agreement on United Nations reform to lead to the decentralization and weakening of the Organization’s pivotal role.  The key role played by the United Nations is of the essence in present international conditions  marked by wars and national conflict. In these early stages of the twenty-first century  we are witnessing a series of new conflicts ever more driven by economic interests and clashes of civilizations  both ethnic and religious  often within the same country.  More than 60 years ago  the signatory States of the Charter of the United Nations assumed the shared responsibility of maintaining international peace and security. They undertook to work together to prevent and remove threats to international security  to suppress acts of aggression and to resolve  through peaceful means  disputes within and between States that could lead to war.  On the sixtieth anniversary of the creation of the United Nations peacekeeping bodies  it is important to remember the men and women who believe in those ideals  who have dedicated themselves to the people of the world  working tirelessly to promote peace and stability worldwide in dangerous war-torn zones with resolve  dedication and professionalism while always remaining impartial and neutral.  However  in spite of all their work  we are still far from attaining those goals and the United Nations has not had a full impact on many international crises. The reform of the United Nations in this context has thus become even more essential. Reform would enable the United Nations to have the necessary strength to act  fully respecting the ideals and objectives that it set itself at its founding.  The Republic of San Marino has always supported the United Nations reform process and  in particular  believes the process of the revitalization of the General Assembly to be fundamental. Those reforms are necessary to reaffirm the role of the General Assembly as the most representative body of the United Nations.   The Republic of San Marino believes that the strengthening of the General Assembly is of even greater significance for  as a profoundly democratic body of the United Nations  it currently represents the most important forum in which a small State can be heard and bring its own contribution at the international level.  Greater efficiency would make the General Assembly more complementary in its relations with the other main bodies of the United Nations  thus avoiding any duplication of activities and establishing mechanisms that would effectively implement the provisions of resolutions adopted by the Assembly.  The process of democratization within the bodies of the United Nations assumes fundamental importance for a small State such as the Republic of San Marino. Greater representation and democratization of the Organization’s main bodies can guarantee States with small territories and populations the possibility of participating and having a larger role in the decision-making process within multilateral bodies.  I am convinced that smaller States like San Marino can contribute in a fundamental way to the Organization precisely because they do not have macroeconomic  military or geopolitical interests.  It is of parallel importance that small States establish efficient forms of collaboration and consultation in order to coordinate their actions so that   43 08-51851  their voices can be adequately heard within international organizations.   In the framework of contacts with other small European States  which are frequently renewed  including on the occasion of our participation in the work of the General Assembly  San Marino has promoted a meeting with other small European States with which it is already collaborating on specific humanitarian projects  to consider other forms of multilateral collaboration.  Having participated with a group of small States in the financing of a UNICEF project for children affected by HIV in Gabon  this year the Republic of San Marino  in concert with the private sector  is taking part in other UNICEF projects aimed  in particular  at protecting the rights of disabled children.  Strong involvement in the protection of children’s rights has characterized relations between San Marino and UNICEF for many years. That commitment was further expressed last December through the participation of Their Excellencies the Captains Regent at the commemorative plenary meeting of the General Assembly on the follow-up to the outcome of the special session on children  an event that lent further impetus to the States’ activities and underscored the need for their cooperation.  Population growth  climate change and the spread of new diseases  as well as economic and financial instability and armed conflicts  are seriously threatening the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). In particular  the subject of climate change has become a priority in the United Nations agenda over the last two years because of its impact on our habits and the future needs of all countries without distinction. Those regions that are most vulnerable due to their geographic position  as well as developing countries  and small islands in particular  are facing an even graver emergency situation.  In addition  the global food crisis and rising prices present a trend that is increasingly distressing. The United Nations and the specialized agencies play a central role in confronting those emergencies. In particular  the Republic of San Marino would like to express its full support to the High-Level Task Force on the Global Food Security Crisis  established by the Secretary-General last April with the precise objective of coordinating all ongoing activities aimed at stemming the crisis.  On the occasion of the opening of the fifty-second session of the Commission on the Status of Women  the Secretary-General announced the launch of the campaign “Unite to End Violence Against Women”. San Marino intends to work in support of that campaign to protect the rights of women  which parallels a commitment undertaken during its chairmanship of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe.  I would like to add that the campaign to combat violence against women was also carried out at the national level  where we tried to raise public awareness of an issue too often ignored or underestimated. Following that initiative  the Parliament of San Marino recently adopted a new law: the Prevention and Repression of Violence against Women and of Gender-Based Violence. It is a decisive and innovative legal instrument for our country that provides for  inter alia  the introduction of preventive measures addressing violence against women and gender-based violence  as well as the protection of victims during criminal proceedings.  The Republic of San Marino also pays particular attention to the problems faced by persons with disabilities and the protection of their rights. San Marino has in fact already ratified the International Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Rights and Dignity of Persons with Disabilities and its Optional Protocol.   The Republic of San Marino is pleased to celebrate the sixtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.   The Republic of San Marino has always been committed to the promotion of the principles of peaceful coexistence and the mutual respect between individuals and peoples  in the knowledge that the understanding of others and mutual respect are the fundamental prerequisites of justice and peace. The promotion of intercultural dialogue is a concrete tool for attaining those values and for affirming one of the guiding principles of the United Nations: peace founded on justice and international cooperation.  San Marino is committed to and continues to work towards the promotion of intercultural dialogue  in particular in its religious dimension. At the regional    08-51851 44  level  in the context of its activities in the Council of Europe  San Marino this year coordinated the Council’s first meeting on the religious dimension of intercultural dialogue  which was held on an experimental basis. Representatives of member States of the Council of Europe  religious leaders  experts and representatives of civil society participated in the meeting. The development of dialogue among and with religions at all levels of society makes a fundamental contribution to preventing tensions which may endanger the peaceful coexistence of peoples  as stressed at the high-level meeting on that subject promoted by the United Nations.  In conclusion  I would like to wish the President great success in his important task and to assure him of our full support during the sixty-third session of the General Assembly. "
"156",6381,"SOM",63,2008,"I take this opportunity to add my voice to those of numerous speakers who extended their warmest congratulations to Mr. d’Escoto Brockmann on his assumption of his responsibilities as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session. I am confident that this world body will benefit from his rich experience and wise guidance.  I also appreciate the Secretary-General’s commitment to putting Africa’s urgent needs at the top of his agenda during his term in office  and particularly his untiring efforts to assist Somalis in finding a lasting solution to their conflict.  In that connection  I propose to confine my remarks first to what I consider to be the most important issues surrounding the development needs of Africa and the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals. Secondly  I will raise some of the major concerns we have about the current situation in Somalia. In recent years  a great deal has been said about Africa and its problems regarding development needs and policy implementation. I would like to dwell briefly on three particular areas: aid  the debt burden and trade.  On the issue of aid to Africa  we are mainly concerned with its quantity  relevance and quality. Of course  we support any measure  be it bilateral or multilateral  likely to increase the effectiveness  coordination and coherence of aid. With regard to the quantity of total official development assistance  most observers would agree that total aid to Africa in the coming years is not likely to increase and may even decrease. Therefore  it would be unrealistic to entertain exaggerated hopes for development through aid. Most donor countries have yet to reach the United Nations-recommended target of dedicating 0.7 per cent of their gross national income to official development assistance.  With regard to the debt burden of many countries in Africa  especially the so-called highly indebted poor countries  we believe that the international community should be doing far more than has been attempted or achieved in recent years. For one thing  the process of reducing debt should be accelerated to give credence to our recognition of the existence of an urgent crisis. We believe that  in respect of the least developed and low-  53 08-52265  income countries  outstanding debts should be totally cancelled. We need to free resources for growth and the achievement of national development goals  including the Millennium Development Goals.  With regard to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals  we need to take a closer look at our development policies and institutions with a view to effecting urgent reforms. Corruption needs to be controlled and better governance given a real boost and not just lip service. Priority attention to agriculture should be reinstated. Africa can and should produce more food.  We are convinced that Africa has enormous potential. We believe that its greatest potential is in the sphere of trade  and less as a recipient of aid or debt relief. In that connection  trade barriers against the agricultural products of Africa should be removed from the markets of the European Union and North America if the developed countries are really serious about aiding the less developed.   As we are all well aware  the Doha Round of negotiations is still at an impasse due to the divergence of interests between the developed and developing members of the World Trade Organization. At the heart of the impasse is the existence of huge subsidies given to farmers in the European Union and North America. Unless those subsidies are totally eliminated or substantially reduced  there is little hope for Africa and developing countries elsewhere to compete in the markets of the developed countries.  I would now like to move from major issues facing development in Africa to the specific problems and prospects of Somalia. We wish first to reaffirm that the Transitional Federal Government of the Somali Republic is fully committed to the implementation of the road map envisaged under the Somali Charter adopted in 2004  despite daunting natural and man-made challenges.  With regard to reconciliation  we wish to point out that a peace and reconciliation agreement was agreed upon and signed between the Transitional Federal Government and the opposition alliance on 19 August 2008 in Djibouti. We are now in the process of implementation  we hope without undue delays. But we are also mindful  after 18 years of conflict  that delays could occur as a result of the tactics of those who have developed a vested interest in anarchy and chaos. It is also important that the leadership  both on the Government side and on the opposition side  show resolve and leadership if the process is to succeed — and succeed it must. We are also determined to ensure that the efforts of saboteurs and spoilers will not keep hostage the whole Somali nation and peace in the region. We hope that we can count on the unambiguous support of the members of this United Nations body and the Security Council.  The situation in Somalia has been on the agenda of the Security Council for a long time. We urge the United Nations and the Security Council to play their part and not to allow opportunities to be lost through a policy of wait and see. Ultimately  history may not be very kind to the way the Security Council has been handling the Somali case when compared to the ways that it has responded to other crises in comparable situations. We urgently need the deployment of a fully fledged United Nations peacekeeping force to restore peace and stability and to create a secure environment for institution-building and socio-economic development.  Let me draw to the Assembly’s attention the increasing acts of piracy and armed robbery against vessels in Somali and adjacent waters  which have resulted in the loss of both human life and property. My Government has strongly condemned those criminal acts  which violate international law and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of l0 December 1982. Those criminal acts of piracy are unacceptable and should be put to an end. Since Somalia has no capacity to interdict vessels or patrol its long coastline to ensure the security of the sea lanes  we call on the international community to cooperate with the Transitional Federal Government in the fight against sea piracy  in conformity with the provisions of paragraph 7 of Security Council resolution 1816 (2008). We stand ready to cooperate with all Member States as well as with the United Nations in implementing that resolution.   We believe that the time has come for the world to take resolute action against the piracy off the coast of Somalia and to put an end to these criminal acts. It is unconscionable that  at the dawn of the twenty-first century  piracy on such a scale has been left unchecked for so long. We applaud the efforts of the Government of France  particularly President Sarkozy  in the fight against the piracy and armed robbery off the coast of Somalia.    08-52265 54   Finally  I would like to touch on the dire humanitarian situation in Somalia  which is the result of conflict  drought and acts of piracy  as well as flooding in some regions. I appeal to the international community to provide more humanitarian aid to the Somali people. I wish to thank the Governments of France  Denmark  the Netherlands and Canada for escorting ships carrying humanitarian aid to Somalia. I would also like to express our profound thanks to all countries that are currently providing humanitarian aid to our country.  Permit me to conclude by emphasizing the importance of conflict prevention  conflict resolution and conflict management  not only in Somalia  but also throughout Africa and the developing world. It is hard to imagine that any meaningful socio-economic development could take place without peace or security. It is not realistic to expect countries in a state of conflict to achieve all or any of the agreed-upon Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Therefore  it is incumbent upon all developing countries  the United Nations and the Security Council to promote the conditions for effective development. Otherwise  the MDGs will appear to be an exercise in wishful thinking. "
"157",6419,"STP",63,2008,"I believe that nearly everything has already been said here since the beginning of the sixty-third session of the General Assembly. Some were things that we Africans wanted to hear and some we could have done without. But I have come to New York once again to join other heads of State who are concerned with the state of the planet  which faces armed conflicts  environmental catastrophes — some naturally occurring and some the result of thoughtless and selfish behaviour and attitudes of some among us — as well as multiple financial crises  including extreme increases in the price of oil and basic food products.   On behalf of the people of the islands of Sao Tome and Principe  I should like to congratulate Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session and to wish him every success. I am certain that the themes he has put forward for discussion at this session are a reflection of his concern about the various international problems currently affecting the world. I would dare say that we are doubly blessed by his qualities as a diplomat  which are well known  and as a priest. Allow me also to take this opportunity to   23 08-51845  thank and commend his predecessor for a job well done.  The report (A/63/1) of the Secretary-General to the Assembly exhaustively describes the world in which we live and reflects the major concerns of Member States while providing guidance on how to resolve them. I believe it to be an important working document that deserves the closest attention from Member States.   The recent upheavals and conflicts that the world has experienced are proof of the fragility of the current system of international relations. That makes it necessary for the world’s main political actors to engage in permanent dialogue to find lasting solutions that will make it possible for nations and peoples to concentrate on social and economic development issues.   With regard to development  I would like to commend the Secretary-General on his selection of themes for the high-level meetings  the first of which took place the day before the opening of the general debate and the second of which is taking place today. We hope that those who  during the first three days of the general debate  have reaffirmed their determination to continue their solidarity towards Africa will translate the intentions expressed here into action.   I need not reiterate my country’s position with regard to chronic unresolved conflicts  especially the situation in the Middle East  including the Palestinian issue  the perennial latent conflict in our subregion that is taking place in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  and the humanitarian situation in Darfur and its impact.   Our attention and available resources are focused on efforts to eradicate poverty  ensure food security and achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Despite the enormous efforts of my people and the hardships they have suffered  my country will not be able to achieve all the Goals by 2015. The food crisis  the financial crisis and the constraints of insufficient aid linked to inadequate processes are all contributing to deteriorating prospects. Paradoxically  the number of poor people is increasing rather than decreasing. We are continuing our efforts to reverse that situation  by example  by greatly increasing microcredit loans in the agriculture and fisheries sectors in an attempt to ensure some measure of food security.   However  despite the relatively unfavourable overall environment  there have been some success stories. For example  in recent years  Sao Tome and Principe has made great progress with regard to child mortality indicators; we are certain that we will achieve the targets established in the MDGs. We have also made progress in the area of education. With adequate support from our partners and the international community  we will be able to achieve the relevant targets set out in the MDGs.   According to data published in 2007  the incidence of HIV/AIDS infection has increased in my country. We have attempted to provide free or subsidized antiretroviral treatment for all  with help from the Federative Republic of Brazil. We are also carrying out an aggressive policy to educate people in order to prevent the disease and promote safe sexual practices.   Sao Tome and Principe is an archipelago that includes three mountainous islands. Despite our mountainous terrain  however  our people are increasingly concerned about the advancing sea at high tide. According to records  no waves higher than three metres have broken on our shores in the past 110 years. However  giant waves have begun to wash over our coastal highways in the past 10 years  temporarily cutting off certain regions of our country. I cannot overemphasize the strong appeal I made from this rostrum in the past to those who are primarily responsible for the global warming that afflicts the planet  namely  that they address this phenomenon and the means to mitigate its effects with much greater seriousness.   In his statement at the opening of the sixty-third session of the General Assembly (see A/63/PV.1)  the Assembly President said that love was the greatest need in today’s world and that the selfishness of some has led to the current situation. This may perhaps be considered overly simplistic coming from the mouth of a head of State  but I believe that that is precisely the core of the problem. Our Governments  diplomats and politicians rarely think in such terms. No people chooses to be poor. Being poor does not imply that we are less intelligent or lazier than others. It all has to do with the opportunities available at the time of birth  as well as to the solidarity and compassion one encounters thereafter — when these are not empty words. Yes  we must re-establish generosity and solidarity among human beings.     08-51845 24   An example of that is the fact that there was a decrease of more than 95 per cent in the number of cases of malaria recorded in Sao Tome and Principe in 2007. As a result  we expect that the disease will soon be eradicated from our country through an ongoing control programme. For the first time in centuries  as confirmed by the most recent report of the World Health Organization on the state of the world’s health  malaria is not the main cause of child mortality and morbidity among the people of my country. That has been possible thanks to the Republic of China on Taiwan.   Speaking of solidarity and Taiwan  once again from this rostrum  I would like to appeal to the conscience of each and every member to consider the fate to which 23 million Taiwanese have been relegated. Will the community of nations represented here continue to ignore the existence of a population comprising more than 23 million people? I must remind the Assembly that the Republic of China on Taiwan is a country with a vibrant democracy and an enviable economic and technological record that has served as a development model for the global economy. On 20 May 2008  we were pleased to see the inauguration of the new President of that friendly country. We paid close attention to his inaugural address  which was a genuine call for peace and good relations in the Taiwan Strait.  Also regarding the lack of solidarity in the world  the embargo against Cuba is another cause for concern that requires our urgent attention. That relic from the past must be lifted on an urgent basis  especially in the aftermath of the destruction caused by the two successive hurricanes that recently struck that friendly nation. The United States Administration has a golden opportunity to demonstrate to the world that the statements of its leaders are not just rhetorical exercises.   At the same time  I would like to make it very clear that Sao Tome and Principe is a tenacious defender of the measures to combat international terrorism and to prevent the further loss of innocent life.   Development strengthens diplomacy and security  reduces threats against our collective security and produces peaceful  stable and prosperous societies. That must be the focus of our efforts. I should therefore  in conclusion  reiterate what I said at the outset: we must all be less selfish and care more about each other  rather than just ourselves.  "
"158",6460,"SUR",63,2008,"Allow me to congratulate you  Sir  on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session. I am pleased to see a member of our regional group of Latin America and the Caribbean in that high office. I am convinced that your longstanding diplomatic experience and in-depth knowledge of current international issues will enable you to successfully discharge the high responsibility of your office. I would also like to recognize the able stewardship and valuable work of your predecessor  Mr. Srgjan Kerim  during the Assembly’s sixty-second session.  To the Secretary-General of the Organization  His Excellency Ban Ki-moon  I pledge Suriname’s full support in implementing the resolutions of the United Nations to achieve the objectives of the United Nations Charter for sustainable development  international peace and security and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.  We are commemorating the sixtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights this year  while many of these rights are still under serious pressure. New threats  such as global warming and climate change and most recently the global food and energy crises  are an infringement on people’s rights to food  health  education  security and the overall freedom to live in dignity. Those tribulations are intertwined and universal and thus beyond the control of any single nation. Millions of vulnerable people are therefore looking to the international community  with the United Nations at the helm  for effective measures to bring some kind of relief.  The Economic and Social Council recently recognized the seriousness and complexity of the global food crisis and reiterated that its consequences require a comprehensive response by national Governments and the international community. It is essential for us to intensify our combined efforts  and we therefore support the emergency global partnership plan for food  called for by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in his address to the General Assembly high-level event on the global food and climate change crises.  The financial and monetary implications of the global crisis require substantial political and financial commitments from us all  from national Governments  from multilateral organizations  including international financial institutions  and from the private sector. We will have to change the way that we  human beings  behave towards Mother Nature and we will have to find a solution to policies and regulations that are detrimental to our progress  such as protectionist agricultural policies in developed countries that are causing low production in the agricultural sector of many developing countries. If we do not find lasting solutions now  the cost of our inaction will be unacceptably high  and the threats that we will most likely pass on to the next generation will be devastating.  My country  Suriname  was on the right track towards achieving some of the Millennium Development Goals  including poverty reduction sustained by economic growth rates of over 5 per cent annually in the past three years  with predictions by renowned international financial institutions of approximately 8 per cent growth for the coming years. As a result of the current food and energy crises  as well as the recent volatility of financial markets  it has now become a challenge for us to keep up the pace and quality of our development.  My Government has taken action and has already put some measures in place to respond to the new difficulties we are facing because of those external developments. We have expanded social security to cover the most needy  such as children  the elderly and people with disabilities  we have put in place food programmes for schoolchildren  and we have increased salaries and Government pensions  which had weakened as a result of years of inflation. The Government has now called upon the private sector to follow its lead and restore eroded salaries and pensions.  Africa  the cradle of humanity  is a continent with immense capability  endowed with indispensable human and natural potential. Paradoxically  in many parts of the continent  development is lagging behind or even absent  and development perspectives are bleak.   27 08-51839   My country commends Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for holding the important high-level meeting on “Africa’s development needs: state of implementation of various commitments  challenges and the way forward”  which took place just two days ago. It is our genuine expectation that the outcome of that meeting will lead to new and unique opportunities for impacting positively on and contributing to the development of Africa.  Suriname remains committed to the promotion and protection of human rights. My country underscores the principle of equality before the law and emphasizes that everyone should be held accountable for their actions. Against that backdrop  Suriname acceded to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court on 15 July of this year. We thus expressed our commitment to fighting the impunity of the perpetrators of gross human rights violations. However  providing the Court with its full potential to meet its mandate depends on a collective commitment at the global level.  Environmental disturbances today are of such magnitude that we can no longer ignore their negative impact on the world’s resources. As a country with 90 per cent of its territory covered by forests within which lies one of the largest stretches of pristine tropical rainforests on earth  Suriname is aware of its value and potential to contribute to the global mitigation of climate change  the conservation of biodiversity and the protection of water resources.  However  the contribution of the international community to the preservation and protection of such globally valuable resources is not proportionate to the sacrifice made by the forested countries. Moreover  forested countries like Suriname with very low deforestation rates are forgotten in mechanisms devised to compensate for deforestation.  Suriname recently hosted the Paramaribo Dialogue  a country-led initiative on financing for sustainable forest management in support of the United Nations Forum on Forests. During that international dialogue  multiple stakeholders from all over the world came together to develop substantive proposals for the establishment of an international financial framework to assist in future sustainable forest management.  We stress the importance of new financing mechanisms  since good management of forests and other natural resources cannot and should not be at the expense of the development of our own peoples  the peoples of countries with high forest coverage and low deforestation rates. We therefore look forward to substantial investments to support the sustainable development of such countries.  Suriname has supported the restructuring process of the United Nations from the start  with the aim of achieving a more effective and efficient Organization that would be better equipped to adequately address old and new challenges. In that process  we expect that the role of the United Nations as a partner in development will gain further relevance and achieve a more coherent and enhanced presence in support of capacity-building and sustainable development.  Suriname is also currently engaged in a “One UN” policy process  through which it responds to the need for coherent involvement of the United Nations in its development efforts. To that end  Suriname and the United Nations agencies signed the Country Programme Action Plan for the period 2008-2011  which also addresses the pursuit of the Millennium Development Goals.  We have entered an era of growing anxieties and concerns that go beyond national borders. The contemporary world situation requires harmonization of the United Nations with current international developments. Suriname believes that the United Nations should be given the tools and instruments to enable the Organization to address global challenges in support of a comprehensive and coherent development agenda in the interest of all the nations of the world."
"159",6484,"SVK",63,2008,"The international community is increasingly confronted with old problems coupled with a new set of challenges of a truly global nature. And as Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said at the opening meeting  under these circumstances we face another daunting challenge — the challenge of global leadership.  We  the united nations of the world  must indeed exercise our leadership  authority and responsibility under these increasingly complex circumstances. We need to start here  at the United Nations  notably in the Security Council  but also in the General Assembly  the Economic and Social Council and other bodies. Cooperation among our countries and with international organizations must broaden. Real partnerships with the private sector and civil society must be pursued more vigorously.   51 08-52265   As part of the European Union efforts  we promote coordinated measures to help developing countries increase the food supply and tackle the current crises in a sustainable manner. Furthermore  fairer international trade rules must be adopted to stimulate agriculture production  beginning in developing countries  and to allow access to foodstuffs.  This year we are at the midpoint of assessing the achievements in moving towards reaching the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015. So far  overall progress on the MDGs has been uneven  at best. Moreover  rising food prices  record energy costs  energy and pipeline security challenges  climate change  growing scarcity of water resources and the recent meltdown of financial centres that started here in the United States — all that threatens to reverse the existing advances towards the MDGs. Most  if not all  of the MDG targets can still be reached  but only if we all work towards them with doubled energy and commitment.  As a former recipient country that has successfully navigated the transition process  Slovakia itself now also provides official development assistance to help meet the MDGs  among other goals.  We are pleased that the democratization of the United Nations is among the key priorities of the year. We support democratization in the sense of increased partnership among the key United Nations bodies and of respect for one other’s mandates.  Slovakia would like to place renewed emphasis on the advancement of the agreed United Nations reform measures  including the management reform of the United Nations Secretariat.  Slovakia remains convinced of the need to reform the Security Council. Based on our own recent experience from serving on the Council  we emphasize the need to make it more representative  more open and more transparent. The Council needs to be enlarged in both its categories. Slovakia supports the ambitions of Germany  Japan  Brazil and India to become permanent members of the Security Council  as well as permanent representation of Africa on the Council. The regional group of Eastern European States needs to be allocated at least one additional non-permanent seat. We thus fully support the launching of intergovernmental negotiations on Security Council reform.  This year we mark the sixtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms  as well as cultivation of the culture of inter-religious and inter-ethnic tolerance  remain my country’s priorities for action in the United Nations. Slovakia was elected a member of the Human Rights Council this year. We will promote universal respect for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all  without distinction of any kind and in a fair and equal manner.  Justice is a prerequisite for peace  security and development  not a contradiction to them. Responsibility to protect should be another leading policy and principle for our joint action  both in relation to genocide  war crimes  ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity and in cases of large-scale natural disasters and catastrophes. We can no longer afford another Rwanda in Darfur or elsewhere.  In this context  we would like to especially commend the African Union for its increasingly active role in putting an end to the most serious crises in Africa  especially the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur and the African Union Mission in Somalia. Here  I would like to acknowledge a continuously growing cooperation between the European Union and the United Nations  currently in some 20 operations and cases.  Nationally owned reform of the security sector  particularly in post-conflict environments  is critical to consolidating peace and stability; promoting poverty reduction  rule of law and good governance; extending legitimate State authority; and preventing countries from relapsing into conflict.  Since its membership in the Security Council  Slovakia has been actively engaged in security sector reform-related efforts as it works in support of the recommendations of the Secretary-General. We are committed to continuing our work as coordinator of the group of friends of security sector reform  as well as to further promoting regional and subregional activities in that area  following a successful workshop in South Africa and a later one in Asia and Latin America.  New challenges to global security should not divert our attention from old and more traditional threats. The world is unfortunately full of disputes  conflicts and crises. We consistently support their resolution through negotiations and peaceful means     08-52265 52  with a central role for the United Nations based on full respect for the principles of international law — notably those of sovereignty and territorial integrity — and we reject the use of force and unilateral action.  That is relevant to the recent developments in Georgia and in the Western Balkans  where we underline the importance of the European and transatlantic perspective for all countries as an essential element in promoting peace  stability and economic progress in the region. One lesson that we have learned is that frozen conflicts and unresolved disputes  if left to fester  tend at times to move into a dangerously hot stage  spread instability and fuel extremism. The conflict in the Middle East is telling in that respect. I should like to stress  as others have  that calls from this rostrum for the annihilation of the State of Israel are unacceptable and deplorable.  We all recognize the importance of supporting the Government of Afghanistan in its efforts to ensure stability and development in the country and to prevent Afghanistan from becoming once again a haven for terrorists. This year  Slovakia has decided to double the number of its soldiers serving in southern Afghanistan  but it is obvious that lasting peace and stability in Afghanistan will depend on solid improvements in the living conditions of Afghan citizens and in good governance.  Slovakia supports enhanced United Nations cooperation in implementing the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. To be more effective  we need an agreement on a comprehensive United Nations convention against international terrorism as soon as possible.  The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery continues to pose a serious threat to international peace and security. We are in particular concerned about our inability to close the issue of the Iran nuclear programme in a way that would be considered by all to be in conformity with the non-proliferation regime. We welcome the extension of the mandate of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1540 (2004).   The tasks confronting us in the year ahead are enormous. They can be accomplished only through our strong and sustained political commitment  working through multilateral mechanisms with the United Nations in the lead and at the centre.  "
"160",6509,"SVN",63,2008,"We are starting this sixty-third session of the General Assembly under the wise and inspiring leadership of our President  Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann. We rely on your experience and your political acumen  Sir  and I wish you every success in your work. At the same time  I wish to express our sincere gratitude to your predecessor  Mr. Srgjan Kerim  President of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session  who guided the Assembly with great sensitivity and determination. I also wish to pay tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  whose tireless efforts are guiding the United Nations at this turbulent time.     08-51749 18   Indeed  we live in a turbulent world at a turbulent time. We need real answers to the accumulated global problems. The era of optimism generated by globalization has come to an end. The eruption of the financial crisis in recent weeks has removed the last shred of doubt about that. The world needs real answers to big questions.  If you asked me to identify the key policy requirement for the United Nations today with a single concept — and in one word — my answer would be this: we live at a time requiring transformation. Transformation should be the key idea of policymaking to guide United Nations action. The United Nations should look to policies with a transformational potential and capable of producing transformational effects in the not-too-distant future. Obviously  that ambitious and general proposition begs further questions. Is the United Nations capable of generating social  political and economic transformation? Does the United Nations of today know what is the main area for the necessary strategic transformation? What needs to be done  by way of transformation  in the most sensitive area of the United Nations mandate  in the area of the maintenance of international peace and security? Allow me to address those questions one by one.  First  is the United Nations capable of generating social and political transformation worldwide? The United Nations has demonstrated such an ability in various areas of its work in the past. United Nations action in the field of human rights offers an excellent example. Later this year we will celebrate the sixtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  and it does not take much effort to realize how much the change that has occurred in those 60 years owes to the transformational energy of human rights.   Consider this: at the time of the adoption of the Universal Declaration in 1948  the world had experienced one of its most traumatic moments. The Second World War was barely over  its aftershocks were still strongly felt  and much of the world was physically destroyed. Stalinist oppression was the dominant feature of the Soviet Union and of a large part of Europe. In Asia and Africa  large populations suffered under the yoke of colonialism. The system of apartheid was being introduced in South Africa. Yet  that was the time when the authors of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights outlined an optimistic vision of a just society and a better world. Human rights were the genuinely transformational idea of the time and that idea has guided social change and development ever since.  The world of today  while still far from ideal  is substantially better than the world of 1948. Human rights have triumphed in many parts of the world and are making steady progress in others. Many of the oppressive systems have ended in the dustbin of history. The remaining ones are likely to follow. Democracy has progressed globally and is today the way of life of more people than ever before.  Obviously  violations of human rights still persist  as reported by the United Nations experts and by non-governmental organizations. Some of the causes of violations  such as racial discrimination  are persistent and take place in new forms. New issues of human rights have also arisen. Concerns related to security and counter-terrorism seem to have contributed to a diminished care for human rights in some societies. The abhorrent practice of torture has gained a degree of acceptance  which should be a cause for serious concern for all those who take human rights seriously. Armed conflicts continue to produce atrocities and massive violations of human rights.   Those phenomena must be met with resolute counteraction. Human rights institutions need to be strengthened and supported. Human rights education deserves higher priority. The principle of the responsibility to protect must be given real meaning and real teeth through diplomatic and other action. The International Criminal Court has to be accepted and made effective as the key institution for punishing perpetrators of war crimes  crimes against humanity and genocide. Violations of human rights have to be combated wherever they occur.  But in addition  there is an even more fundamental reality that affects the actual enjoyment of human rights by all. The Universal Declaration proclaimed  in its article 28  that everyone is entitled to a social and international order in which their human rights can be fully realized. The authors of the Declaration realistically envisaged the long-term nature of the effort for human rights. Guided by that spirit  the General Assembly adopted  in 1986  its Declaration on the Right to Development  a right which became recognized as universal at the World Conference on Human Rights held in Vienna in 1993. That was a significant and realistic recognition of the intrinsic link   19 08-51749  between two fundamental human aspirations: the one for human freedom and the other for human development. In subsequent years  the United Nations also developed a comprehensive understanding of what development is and what it means in our era. That understanding was elaborated at a series of global conferences in the 1990s and summarized in the year 2000 in the form of the agreement on global development goals.  The vision exists and practical progress  while still uneven  is visible. The high-level meeting on Africa last Monday strengthened the existing global consensus about the immediate priorities for Africa  including more effective financing for development. The panel discussions on the Millennium Development Goals tomorrow will be an opportunity to discuss the key issues of today  in particular those emerging from the current food crisis. I also hope that the proposal of the Secretary-General for a summit to consider progress in the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals in 2010 will gain wide support.  Those and other discussions also help in answering my second question: does the United Nations know the strategic direction in which the transformational effort must be concentrated today? Yes  the Millennium Development Goals are part of the answer  but it is already clear that global development — now and in the foreseeable future — will vitally depend on the preservation of our natural environment and  in particular  on how we address the problems of energy and global warming. The battle for our common  global future will be won — or lost — on the environmental front  and that is where the main transformational effort has to take place. There is no time to lose.  Earlier this year  the European Union  under the presidency of my country  Slovenia  adopted a plan of activities to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases. Yesterday  President Sarkozy of France  the current President of the European Council  reiterated the European Union commitment to the success of the Bali road map and the Copenhagen conference to be held next year. In the meantime — and I wish to emphasize this — progress must be made at the conference in Poznan  Poland  and in the process leading to the Copenhagen conference and to the final global agreement.  But those efforts will succeed only if an adequate partnership is established among the key economic and political players. Partnership between the European Union  the United States  Japan  China  India and the Group of 77 countries is essential. The existing environmental challenges call for a transformational approach to the way the world consumes energy  the way it develops technology and the way it pursues development. Incremental change will not do. Global cooperation is essential. Obviously — and I would underline this — the responsibilities of the developed and the developing countries are not the same. They are differentiated. But the world as a whole has to move ahead and the United Nations has to get the direction right. Transformation is the order of the day.  My third question relates to the maintenance of international peace and security and the necessary transformation in that area. Allow me to state right at the outset that there is a serious need for transformation of the existing institutions in the field of international security.  The international security landscape today offers a mixed picture. After the end of the cold war  there were moments of high hopes and moments of deep disappointment. There were successes and failures  including the failure to prevent genocide. But we also have to point out that the overall number of armed conflicts has been declining for more than a decade now. That is an encouraging development indeed  and it is in no small measure due to the contribution of the United Nations  which has steadily increased its experience and its capacity in peacekeeping  post-conflict peacebuilding and  to some extent  preventive diplomacy. The role of the Secretary-General has been strengthened in all those areas.  The progress made so far has established a degree of confidence in the capacity of the international security structures and their key players to cooperate and  even more  to work in partnership for the maintenance of international peace and security. However  it appears that the confidence developed thus far is still fragile and that remnants of the cold war mentality are still in existence. Further efforts are therefore needed. Those efforts  in my opinion  involve two basic sets of tasks.   The first set of tasks relates to the development of partnerships to address the key security issues  in particular those in the Middle East  the Caucasus  the    08-51749 20  Balkans and several regions of Africa. In all those areas  there has been a degree of success in establishing cooperation and partnership among the key regional and global players working for peace. Models of concerted diplomacy such as the one established to deal with the issues of North Korea can and should inspire preventive diplomacy and peacemaking in other parts of the world.  The second set of tasks is equally urgent. Immediate consideration has to be given to a transformation of the existing security structures. Reform of the Security Council is long overdue. Incremental improvements of its working methods  while welcome  are far from sufficient. The time is ripe for changes in the Council’s structure. I believe that the membership of the Security Council should be expanded  and that that should be done in three directions. First  there should be six additional permanent members from every region of the world. Secondly  there should be an additional category of non-permanent members with a more frequent rotation  six in any particular composition of the Security Council  and they should be elected in accordance with a formula to be determined by the General Assembly and alternate every second two-year term. Thirdly  the remaining eight non-permanent members would be elected in accordance with the principle of equitable geographic distribution. This three-point idea means that the total size of the reformed Security Council would not exceed 25 members; it would be a 25-member Council. It would be a more representative Council and  I believe  a more effective one.   I offer those ideas on reform of the Security Council to you  Mr. President  to use in the coming efforts for Council reform. It is widely accepted that that work needs to progress towards a successful conclusion. Success in Council reform would represent a key contribution to the transformation of the international security architecture. Together with other major projects of the United Nations  it would constitute a significant contribution to the improvement of the world.  Allow me to conclude. Is all of this new? In a certain sense  yes  because some of the specific tasks and specific projects are new. But more deeply  the answer is that all of this has to do with continuity. The United Nations has  from its inception  represented the hope for and the promise of an improved world. Let us not betray that hope and let us live up to that promise. Let us work for transformation wherever necessary. Let us make this era the finest hour of the United Nations."
"161",6554,"SWE",63,2008,"The United Nations was built on common values and norms. The United Nations Charter  the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other key documents not only express those values and norms  but also constitute international law  the foundation upon which every attempt to build a lasting peace must rest. Rules of international law apply equally to all States  large and small. According to the United Nations Charter  “Members shall settle their international disputes by peaceful means” and “refrain … from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State”. We look to the United Nations  and in particular to the Security Council  to uphold those rules. The five permanent members have a special responsibility in that regard.  Russia’s invasion of Georgia — a sovereign State and a Member of the United Nations — using massive military force  is a clear violation of the United Nations Charter. Russia’s subsequent recognition of parts of Georgia as independent States stands in stark contradiction to international law  including principles and commitments agreed in the context of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe  including the Helsinki Final Act. Sweden unreservedly supports the territorial integrity of Georgia. We call on Russia to fulfil its obligations in accordance with the six-point plan brokered by the European Union and to withdraw all forces to their positions before 7 August.  This year marks the sixtieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. While celebrating the achievements  we recognize the challenges that remain. The Declaration’s historic article 21 on democracy  which reads in part: “Everyone has the right to take part in the government of his country  directly or through freely chosen representatives”  is a perfect illustration of that point. Since 1948  millions of people have gained the freedom of democratic choice  while millions of others are still denied that freedom.  Sweden places a strong emphasis on democracy and human rights in our development cooperation. Our efforts to make the Universal Declaration and other human rights norms a reality everywhere must also include the United Nations itself. Human rights should be an essential part of all United Nations activities  including conflict prevention  peacekeeping and peacebuilding efforts  as well as in the work of the funds and programmes.  To fight terrorism is to defend human rights. Human rights are the key also to countering terrorism. Measures against terrorism will be effective and legitimate only when they are taken within a clear framework of international law. It is essential that the Security Council have fair and clear procedures in matters of listing and delisting when targeted sanctions have been imposed. The fight against impunity has to continue. We must support the International Criminal Court. Bringing to justice those responsible for the most serious crimes is vital to building sustainable peace. At the same time  justice should be pursued in a manner that supports peace processes.  States have a responsibility to protect people within their own borders from massive violations of    08-53141 48  their human rights. If a State is not capable of doing so  it should ask the international community — the United Nations or regional organizations — for help. We must all be ready to assist. Not long ago  the United Nations and the African Union were able to help Kenya to prevent a frightening crisis from turning into the worst possible nightmare. If a State is unwilling to protect people within its borders  the Security Council must assume its responsibility to protect. We need a Security Council that is ready to shoulder that responsibility and to work together  because unilateral action might run the risk of aggravating the problem and undermining international law and legitimacy.  Violence against women and girls is a major obstacle to the full enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms by all people. Efforts to combat such violence must not end with a peace agreement. We must ensure that women have full access to justice  also in the transition from war to peace. Last June  the landmark Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) on women and peace and security was followed up by Security Council resolution 1820 (2008) on sexual violence. It reaffirms that rape and other forms of sexual violence can be war crimes or crimes against humanity. It obliges Governments to combat such behaviour by all necessary means. Although the United Nations has made considerable efforts in that area  more needs to be done  both in the field and at Headquarters.  The European Union and the Council of Europe have established 10 October as the European Day against the Death Penalty. I hope that before too long we shall be able to agree on a United Nations day against that inhumane form of punishment.  We face a growing danger of nuclear proliferation. Iran  though not the only case  is the most worrisome at present. Recent developments in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea also give cause for concern. The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) is the cornerstone of non-proliferation and the foundation for the pursuit of nuclear disarmament. Sweden is strongly committed to upholding and further strengthening existing multilateral disarmament and non-proliferation obligations. The nuclear Powers have taken on special commitments within the NPT process. In order not to undermine the Treaty  they must demonstrate their readiness to substantially reduce their nuclear arsenals.  More efforts are needed  in particular in Africa  to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015. Therefore  Sweden is increasing its support to Africa. We encourage others to do the same  as well as to deliver on the aid commitments already made. In the long run  the rise in the price of energy and food could have a positive effect on development in the agricultural sector. In the short run  however  it could jeopardize the fulfilment of the MDGs and threaten progress already made. Communicable diseases  not least HIV/AIDS  are another obstacle to the achievement of the MDGs that we must address. The Accra meeting on the Paris Declaration took important steps towards better aid effectiveness and reconfirmed the shared responsibility for development. However  much more must be done in areas such as democratic governance and human rights  the role of women in development  and the impact of global climate change.  That is a challenge for developing and developed countries alike. The world economy is facing turbulence and uncertainty. A more open trade regime would bring increased economic growth and interdependence  which in turn would have a significant stabilizing effect. Trade policy is one of the tools to help developing countries become integrated into the world economy and reap the benefits of trade. Trade reforms are fundamental for sustainable economic growth and poverty reduction. We regret the failure to reach a breakthrough in the World Trade Organization Doha Round. We all share a responsibility to resolve the few remaining issues.  The United Nations system — both in the field and at Headquarters — must be reformed in order to ensure coherence and effectiveness. Reforms must also enable the United Nations to work more effectively on gender issues and for the promotion of equal rights and opportunities.  The United Nations needs to bolster its capacity to handle the unprecedented demand for peace operations. Cooperation with regional organizations and arrangements  such as the European Union  NATO and the African Union  is essential.  Sweden strongly supports efforts to bridge crisis management and long-term development in post-conflict situations. By chairing the Burundi configuration of the Peacebuilding Commission  we hope to be able to contribute to further developing the role of the United Nations in peacebuilding.   49 08-53141   Sweden was proud to host the first annual review meeting of the International Compact with Iraq. The partnership between the Government of Iraq and the United Nations is crucial. It is therefore imperative to continue strengthening the role of the United Nations in Iraq.  It is the poorest who are the hardest hit by climate change. Therefore  Sweden is providing additional resources for a special climate initiative in our development cooperation. It aims to contribute effectively to long-term efforts to combat climate change and its effects in developing countries.  Climate change is a crucial challenge facing our planet. We recognize our responsibility to take concrete steps at home and to show the leadership necessary to achieve broad and long-term international consensus. One year from now  Sweden will hold the presidency of the European Union. In that capacity  Sweden will take on a special responsibility regarding efforts to put an international climate agreement in place by 2009 in Copenhagen. The key to a successful conclusion of those negotiations  however  rests with each and every one of us.  It is time to once again remind ourselves of our mutual commitments and to stand up for the universal principles underpinning international cooperation. It is time to muster the political will to reassert our shared values. It is time to show that we are determined to work jointly to foster peace  democracy and development worldwide. "
"162",6592,"SWZ",63,2008,"I am pleased to address this Assembly on behalf of my delegation from the Kingdom of eSwatini. The Assembly gives us the opportunity as Heads of State and Government to share ideas and experiences. It enables us to shape the future of our countries and pave a way for a better world  where we can all live with each other in harmony. Let me extend our appreciation to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and to the entire staff of the United Nations for their efforts in carrying out the vision and programmes of the United Nations.  The world continues to face many challenges  which include the catastrophic effects of climate change  complicated diseases such as tuberculosis  malaria and the HIV/AIDS epidemic  and food shortages. That situation is further compounded by high prices for fuel and food and the instability in international finance  which slow down our efforts to fight poverty and attain sustainable development.  It is encouraging to note that the United Nations  in particular the Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Food Programme  continues to assist developing countries to find lasting solutions to the food crisis. In the light of that  my country has put in place various strategies to ensure food security. The nation continues to hold consultations on those issues. For instance  we had a national agricultural meeting last year and the Sibaya — the people’s parliament — this year  which looked at ways of increasing our food production and other issues of national interest. The nation came up with different suggestions  and we are in the process of implementing them.  We developing countries were looking forward to positive results from the Doha round of negotiations  particularly on agriculture. Developing countries were hoping for secure and increased market access for their agricultural products. Unfortunately  that has not been the case. We hope those talks will be concluded soon for the benefit of the developing countries.  Swaziland fully supports the global dialogue to ensure that the world is rescued from the dangers of global warming and other damage to the environment. It is true that global warming is a major contributor to the many calamities such as earthquakes  flooding and persistent droughts that threaten the very existence of the human race.  Swaziland  like many other countries of the world  continues to be a victim of the devastating effects of climate change. We continue to suffer from a persistent drought. We continue to be hit by strong winds that cause wildfires. Those fires often destroy vast acres of our man-made forests  resulting in economic disruption  the waste of many years of investment and loss of life and property. We fully agree with the United Nations that failure to respond in a timely way and decisively to that threat will undermine national and international efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  which aim to improve the living standards and welfare of all our peoples.  The high-level meeting on Africa’s development needs came at the most opportune time. We are pleased with the adoption of the declaration (resolution 63/1) and we are looking forward to its effective implementation. There is indeed urgency in addressing Africa’s special needs  in particular economic development  poverty reduction and issues of peace and security.  It should be noted that the cooperation and support of the international finance institutions is pivotal  for instance by ensuring improved accessibility to finance for Africa. That should also include making grants and loans available to African countries under preferential rates to fund infrastructure development  technology transfer  tourism and other projects that are meant to create wealth and economic growth.  As we pass the midpoint to the 2015 deadline for the MDGs we still face many challenges. This is more so because many of our people are still living in poverty and we continue to face a high unemployment rate. Notwithstanding  the commitment of the Kingdom of Swaziland to the achievement of the MDGs is unwavering. The MDGs are anchored within our national development strategy and the poverty reduction strategy and action plan  which aspire  among other things  to reduce poverty by more than half by 2015. All Government programmes are geared towards that vision and are being implemented with the guidance of all stakeholders and the nation at large.  Like many other countries  the Kingdom of Swaziland is on track for some of the MDGs. We are   7 08-51851  doing everything possible to achieve universal education and are providing resources for every child to go to school. Efforts are being made to achieve gender equality and the empowerment of women  ensure environmental sustainability  reduce child mortality and to combat HIV/AIDS  tuberculosis and malaria  among other targets.  Peace  stability and security  which form the primary goals of the United Nations  remain key pillars of meaningful development. When those conditions prevail  our peoples can concentrate their energies and resources on the pursuit of productivity and wealth creation.  Members of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) are committed to upholding those pillars for a better life for all. We have put in place structures such as the SADC Organ on Politics  Defence and Security to ensure their preservation and promotion. For that reason  we applaud the recent signing of the power-sharing agreement and the establishment of a Government of national unity in Zimbabwe. We look forward with optimism to the rebuilding process and the removal of all bottlenecks. In that regard  we urge the international community and the developed world to fully support the people of Zimbabwe. In the same spirit  we wish to see peacefully negotiated settlements for all conflicts that prevail in Africa and in different parts of the world.  The Kingdom of eSwatini joins the rest of the world in condemning all forms and acts of terrorism. We support efforts for the full implementation of the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy in order to send a clear message to all perpetrators of terrorism. In line with the United Nations convention on terrorism  our parliament has recently promulgated the anti-terrorism act.  If the United Nations is to have a more effective role  its structure must be reformed to adapt to a world that has been constantly changing since the adoption of the Charter. These reforms should of course take place in a fair  just and balanced manner. It has been observed in the past that one of the most important of the reforms that require urgent attention is that of the Security Council. The widely held view is that the Security Council as constituted at present falls short of proper demographic representation of United Nations Members. The Kingdom of eSwatini looks forward to a speedy conclusion to the discussions on the reform of the United Nations.  We welcome the recent handshake between the senior leadership of the Republic of China on Taiwan and that of mainland China. This handshake gives us hope that the two are now talking to each other. Hopefully  this might lead to an amicable resolution of the cross-Strait relations  such that perhaps one day we might see them sitting next to each other here at the United Nations. It should be noted that the people of Taiwan have expertise and experience  which they are ready to share with the United Nations family. That is why Swaziland requests the United Nations to allow Taiwan to participate in its specialized agencies.  The Kingdom of Swaziland has just held a successful parliamentary election under a new constitution. The voter turnout was most impressive as the people exercised their right to vote for a government of their choice. As the nation continues to appreciate the power of parliamentary representation in a complex globalized world  we note that the electorate understands the importance of choosing candidates of high calibre with the capacity to handle the issues at hand. That gives us confidence that the new Parliament will assist with strategies that will further improve our socio-economic climate for the betterment of the living standards of our people.  The Kingdom of eSwatini reaffirms its commitment to the purpose and preservation of the central role of the United Nations in multilateral affairs. We treasure peace and development and amicable regional and international relations and  together with all nations  will work towards a peaceful and prosperous future for all humankind. "
"163",6621,"SYC",63,2008,"I have come to this gathering of nations as a representative of one of the smallest nations on the planet. Seychelles is but a speck on the globe  home to some 87 000 people — a people that   7 08-51845  believes in justice  freedom and fairness. In this concert of nations  every country great or small has a voice. Our voice comes from the heart of a people that  like countless others  lives in trepidation. I have come here neither to beg nor to accuse  but to reach out to the conscience of all who have gathered here at the United Nations. I ask them to feel the heartbeat of humanity.  When this great institution was founded over six decades ago  its architects were motivated by noble and just ideals: human freedom and dignity  justice  human rights  peace  security  harmony and development. Those ideals are values that we hold dear  timeless values that are the soul of the United Nations. I have faith in those values. So do the people of Seychelles.  Have we lived up to those values? Yes  we have averted many wars. We have resolved many conflicts. But in this age of relative peace and security  new enemies are staring us in the face: hunger  pandemics  underdevelopment  poverty  economic turmoil  environmental degradation and the inequity of the global trading system. Those are the enemies which  if not overcome  will shatter the foundation of civilization. Those are the enemies that we have to battle and conquer to create a better world for our children and their children. Those are the battles that we have to win to save our planet. Those are the issues that the modern United Nations has to grapple with and overcome.  Can it succeed? I believe it can. It can if we endow it with a new vision — a vision in which hope for mankind goes beyond rhetoric; a vision that provides for bold leadership  clear commitments and targets so that we can focus on the greater good for humankind; a vision in which leaders come together  setting aside petty differences and charting a new course for the United Nations  a new road map to resolve the climate crisis and an appropriate framework for the energy and food crisis; a vision in which appropriate institutional reforms are put in place and adequate resources mobilized to achieve the Millennium Development Goals; a vision that encompasses justice and fairness in trade and in which the specificities of small island developing States are not only recognized but accepted as criteria for aid to further development.  I believe in that vision. We can all share it; we can all help to make it a reality. Our deeds have to be governed by firm commitments to and perseverance in finding sustainable  pragmatic and equitable solutions to the complex issues that threaten our very existence.  We should abandon solutions that continue to enrich the rich and impoverish the poor and the vulnerable. When it comes to world trade  for example  it seems acceptable to some that wealthy countries are allowed to give subsidies to their farmers  as a result of which exports from developing countries become uncompetitive  but that developing countries are obliged to follow World Trade Organization rules to the letter  even if they undermine domestic economic policies formulated to protect vulnerable sectors of society.  We offer facilities to foreign investors to exploit our natural resources  which are traded for high profits on the international market  while we receive a pittance in licensing fees. It is like taking a bowl of food from the poor and giving them back a spoonful as a generous donation. For instance  of the total value of tuna — our “blue gold” — caught and trans-shipped in our waters by foreign fishing vessels every year  Seychelles receives only 7 per cent in revenue  comprising licensing and trans-shipment fees. That situation is  to my mind  unacceptable. I ask whether it is unreasonable to fight for a better share of the proceeds.  On a separate but related note  while the prevailing situation of insecurity in international waters off the coast of Somalia is of grave concern to the international community  it is of graver concern to Seychelles  whose exclusive economic zone borders that maritime zone of hazard. A little more than a week ago  some 40 European fishing vessels lay idle in Port Victoria as a result of an act of piracy on one of their own. Such acts can have a serious impact on the lifeline of the second pillar of our economy at a time when we are engaging with the Bretton Woods institutions in a process of economic reforms. I wish to thank all our partners and friends — in particular France — for all the efforts they have deployed against that scourge.  The skewed nature of the global trade regime is not the only impediment to development. I return to the case of my country. The fact that we have a high human development index  ranked fiftieth in the world  and that we fall in the middle-income group of countries excludes us from access to grants and soft loans that would have helped our country to develop    08-51845 8  even further and faster. And that is despite the fact that donor organizations have confirmed that all aid  grants or loans that have been given to Seychelles have been properly and accountably utilized for the benefit of our people. It is as if we were being penalized for our success in raising the standard of living of our people. We have fallen into the so-called middle-income trap.  Furthermore  no account is taken of the fact that Seychelles falls into the category of highly vulnerable countries as defined by the Commonwealth vulnerability index. Why should our relative success be the reason for the denial of access to special development funds  especially those addressing education  water  sanitation and health? Is that the price we have to pay for improving the quality of life of our people? Is that the price we have to pay for dedicating over 50 per cent of our territory to environmental conservation for the benefit of the whole world?  Our natural environment is our future  our treasure trove of biodiversity. We attach the highest importance to its preservation  not only for ourselves  but also for the rest of the world.  Like many other small island States  Seychelles remains vulnerable to the threats posed by global warming  climate change and rising sea levels. These phenomena are linked to human activity on our planet that  collectively  the nations of the world have the power to influence — if only we had the will to do so.  It is not right that small island States should have to run the risk of being submerged by rising sea levels while some nations refuse even to acknowledge their responsibility for the high levels of environmental pollution now threatening the planet’s resources.  Despite our small size  we shall continue to lead. And we shall lead by example. By our example  we have shown and will continue to show to all that sustainable development and the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) are achievable in our present generation.  Through our efforts and with the support of international NGOs  we have started a global movement — the Global Island Partnership — to get all small islands and nations with islands to devote part of their natural resources to environmental resilience and sustainability. And  more recently  Seychelles set up the Sea Level Rise Foundation to galvanize global action to address the devastating impact of climate change on our planet.   Are those worthy causes not deserving of international support  especially in the International Year of Planet Earth? We are running out of time  and we must combine our resources and know-how to avoid the physical damage and social and economic toll that threaten us.  Some of the greatest afflictions of humankind today are hunger  starvation and malnutrition. Today  food security is our foremost concern. The challenge for many Governments is to bring food to ordinary people at affordable prices. The dramatic increase in grain prices has led to huge increases in the price of bread  milk  meat and other commodities. The hungry are getting hungrier  more desperate and angrier. The divide between rich and poor is widening day by day. We are faced with the looming threat of starvation on a global scale and  with it  the prospect of violent upheavals.  We can act to resolve the food crisis. First  there must be political commitment. Secondly  subsidies given to farmers by the industrialized countries have to be removed. Thirdly  the industrialized countries should make available to the South much-needed resources to improve our infrastructure. Give us the resources  technology and infrastructure to produce more food and there will be no need to help us feed ourselves.  Mankind has had a hand in most  if not all  of the crises we face today. We gather here every year in the name of freedom  human rights  democracy and sustainable development to deliver eloquent speeches. In the process  we procrastinate and bury solutions to our problems in reams of resolutions and declarations.  Can we honestly say that we have got our priorities right? Can we say that we live in a just world  where every man  woman and child enjoys the same rights? Are we  as leaders  living up to the noble goals for which the United Nations was set up? Let our conscience provide us with the answers.  A revamped United Nations system is best placed to facilitate progress in all the areas I have mentioned: food security  trade  climate change and energy. I am asking for a clear action plan. Multiple conferences and talk shops are not the solution. We need a fresh and effective approach to global governance and I am   9 08-51845  convinced that with the right level of resources  and with the political will and commitment  we can start to tackle the fundamental flaws in our global governance and trade regimes. I am asking the rich nations to support that endeavour and assume their collective global responsibility.  Let those of us who believe in freedom and dignity show solidarity among ourselves. Let us help each other to overcome the obstacles in our path. Let us focus on a global vision for the betterment of every nation.  In conclusion  I leave members with this note of reflection: “History to the defeated May say Alas but cannot help or pardon ...” W. H. Auden’s words will define the future of humanity  in terms of its history. The time for action is at hand. We must change  or be redefined by history  like many great civilizations of the past. "
"164",6667,"SYR",63,2008,"Allow me to congratulate the President and his friendly country  Nicaragua  on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session. I wish him every success in his mission and express our satisfaction with the message of his introductory remarks at the opening of the general debate. I would also like to thank his predecessor  Srgjan Kerim  for successfully steering the work of the previous session. I extend to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon our best wishes for success in the realization of the purposes and principles of the Charter of our international Organization.  The Middle East region is one of the most volatile regions of the world  and it continues to face mounting challenges. Daunting as those challenges may be  they must not deter us from moving forward towards the light at the end of the tunnel and from seeking better conditions. Syria is an essential part of the solutions sought by the peoples of the region  by virtue of its geographic location and the aspirations of its people.   For that reason  President Bashar Al-Assad took the initiative to convene the Damascus Quartet Summit  attended by President Sarkozy of France  the Emir of the State of Qatar  Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani  and the Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey. All of those States have a stake in the security and stability of the Middle East region. Each and every one has made constructive contributions  despite differing perspectives and positions. The four leaders probed the issue of peace and stability in the Middle East and stressed the need for consultations and coordination and joint pursuit of those objectives. They recognized that inaction  the suffering resulting from the Israeli occupation of Arab territories that has continued since 1967 and disregard for the Palestinian people’s rights have driven the people of the region into a state of despair. Under those circumstances  attaining a just and comprehensive peace becomes untenable and the region becomes a fertile ground for anger and turmoil. In the final analysis  that situation does not serve the best interests of the world or of the countries of the region.  By convening the Quartet Summit  Syria stressed that a just and comprehensive peace is its strategic choice and that it is striving to attain it in cooperation with regional and international partners who share its vision. The realization of peace requires all of those who have a direct stake in the matter  or those who have the power or who can influence the outcome  to evince the necessary political will.  A/63/PV.13   08-53122 18   Years after the will to build peace lost its priority status in the policies that influence the situation in the region  we were asked to go to Annapolis. We all went to Annapolis  despite the ambiguity of the undertaking. We wonder what Annapolis achieved. Where exactly do we stand? Have the Annapolis promises to establish a Palestinian State before the end of the current year been fulfilled? Has Israel stopped building settlements in the occupied Arab territories?  Despite all that  given that the withdrawal of Israel from our occupied Golan to the line of 4 June 1967 and making peace are Syrian national priorities  and notwithstanding the circumstances to which I just referred  we entered into indirect negotiations with Israel  with commendable mediation by Turkey.   As President Al-Assad said  we wanted the negotiations to establish the grounds and pave the way for direct negotiations that would ultimately be sponsored by many international parties. Peacebuilding requires  however  genuine Israeli will that is capable of accommodating the exigencies of peacemaking. It also requires the American will to include peace in the Middle East on its list of priorities after years of deliberately ignoring and dodging the question  which has exacerbated the situation in the region.  Syria stresses once again its firm and consistent support for the Palestinian people’s rights to recover their occupied land and establish their independent State with Jerusalem as its capital. Syria underlines the need to restore Palestinian national unity through national dialogue and is working towards that end in its capacity as the current Chair of the Arab Summit.  The Iraqi situation is a matter of prime concern to Syria because Iraq is an Arab fraternal country and because  as a neighbouring country  we are affected by the negative and positive developments there. We have always stressed the need to preserve the unity of the people of Iraq  its territorial integrity  non-interference in its internal affairs and the need to preserve its sovereignty  independence  its Arab and Islamic identity  and to oppose the calls to divide it. We have repeatedly declared that the solution in Iraq begins with national reconciliation built on the principle of respect for the will of all Iraqis. We have reiterated the need for foreign troops to withdraw from Iraq in line with agreements reached with the Iraqi Government. We have always condemned all terrorist acts committed in Iraq  resulting in the deaths of many innocent civilians. We believe that the stability that Iraq longs for requires an Iraqi consensus to overcome the obstacles barring its realization.  It is regrettable that the abnormal circumstances that prevailed in Iraq as a result of the United States invasion in 2003 have prompted a great number of Iraqis to leave their country in pursuit of safety and security. Syria hosts many Iraqi brothers and sisters. Therefore  we are deeply aware of the humanitarian crisis that has forced Iraqis from their country and exacerbated the situation in their country. We hope that an improved security situation will permit all Iraqis to return to Iraq.  We in Syria are pleased that the situation in Lebanon is being resolved after the conclusion of the Doha Agreement  which enabled the Lebanese to elect a consensual President  establish a Government of national unity and initiate a national dialogue. Despite unfounded claims to the contrary  we have consistently supported all measures that could assist the Lebanese in arriving at consensual solutions built on dialogue and the affirmation of national unity. During the recent visit of the Lebanese President Michel Sleiman to Syria  we declared that we had jointly decided to establish diplomatic relations between our two countries with a view to maintaining and supporting mutual  deep and wide-ranging relations and interests between our two fraternal peoples. We also agreed to resume the work of the joint Lebanese-Syrian border demarcation commission in accordance with mechanisms and priorities to be agreed upon by the two parties. The two countries also agreed to entrust to their respective authorities the task of continuing to work together to control their common borders  fight smuggling  undertake the necessary measures to promote trade  create the conditions for economic integration and establish a common economic market.  Syria supports efforts aimed at guaranteeing the Sudan’s unity and territorial integrity and promoting peace and stability in that country. In that context  we are completely opposed to the decision of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court and call on the Security Council to suspend it with a view to creating favourable conditions for pursuing the initiative endorsed by the Council of Ministers of the League of Arab States on 9 August 2008. The initiative called for establishing an Arab ministerial committee under the chairmanship of Qatar and entrusting it with overseeing comprehensive peace talks between the  A/63/PV.13 19 08-53122  Government of the Sudan and the armed groups in Darfur. The committee would sponsor those negotiations in cooperation and coordination with the international mediator of the African Union and a United Nations representative. It would also seek to improve the humanitarian situation and to promote development in Darfur.   Syria  a member of the committee  calls on all States concerned and on the international community to support the committee in its efforts to fulfil its mandate. In that regard  Syria welcomes the normalization of relations between the Sudan and Chad as a positive contribution to the solution of the Darfur question.  The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) guarantees the right of all States to possess nuclear technologies for peaceful purposes. Much has been said about the Iranian nuclear issue  with some advocating a diplomatic solution while others promote the use of force. Meanwhile  Iran has time and again stressed that it is solely dedicated to the peaceful uses of nuclear power. Deep mistrust between Iran and its interlocutors complicates matters and prevents the stakeholders from reaching an understanding. We seek a political understanding of the Iranian nuclear issue. Any other option is not in the interests of any of the stakeholders and will only inflict catastrophic losses on the region and the world.  In that context  and in line with our principled position  we call for declaring the Middle East a zone free from all weapons of mass destruction. Similarly  we recall the draft resolution that Syria submitted to the Security Council on 29 October 2003. At the same time  we stress the need to compel Israel to dismantle the hundreds of nuclear warheads in its possession  to submit its nuclear facilities to the safeguards regime of the International Atomic Energy Agency and to accede to the NPT.  The crisis that erupted in the Caucasus region was an extremely ominous event. It is impossible to ignore its dimensions and repercussions on international relations. By now  we know who sowed its seeds and are aware of the provocative acts associated with it  prompting Russia to exercise the option it chose. We appreciate Russia’s positive response to the efforts of France in its capacity as President of the European Union to arrive at a settlement of the crisis that will guarantee regional stability and spare the world a revival of the international relations that prevailed in the past.  Much has been said about the war on terror. Years after waging that war  some issues still prompt us to ask: Is terrorism less widespread today than it was before? Can we claim to have prevailed over that extremely dangerous phenomenon? Accusing countries of sponsoring terrorism for ulterior political motives is a desperate attempt by those promoting those claims to justify the failure of their approach.   The right approach requires us to address the root causes of terrorism. How can we overcome terrorism if we continue to conflate terrorism with the right of the individual to live on his land  free from occupation or threat of war and aggression? We call upon all States to cooperate in the fight against terrorism. We particularly stress the need to avoid confusing terrorism with fundamental rights  because doing so gives terrorism an opportunity to strike.  Experience demonstrates that unilaterally dictating the world’s political agenda is wrong. The wars and the financial and food crises raging throughout the world today require us to work together to address that malfunction by seeking to engage all regional and international stakeholders through active diplomacy and dialogue as the means to settle controversial questions.  Closing the door to dialogue and imposing isolation  unilateral sanctions and diktats have never been successful tools in the exercise of sound international relations. Contrary to claims made from this very rostrum a couple of days ago  all attempts at isolation are doomed to failure. Respect for the principle of democracy in international relations that takes into account the vision and interests of all States  large and small  will contribute to the realization of security and stability in the world and help it solve the problems it faces.   The Charter of our international Organization  in which States of different perspectives and interests enjoy equal membership  has set forth formulas that remain valid and could be used to build a world in which justice reigns supreme  based on mutual understanding — a world free from the threat of terror and in which there is no place for inciting hatred among cultures and religions. Promoting those values  principles and objectives and using them as guidelines for our work will serve the interests of peace and A/63/PV.13   08-53122 20  stability in the world and contribute to the good of humanity at large. "
"165",6712,"TCD",63,2008,"On behalf of my delegation and on my own behalf  I would like to most warmly congratulate you  Mr. President  on your election to presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session. The delegation of Chad is convinced that your qualities and experience in the area of international relations will ensure success for our current session  and we would like to assure you of our cooperation as you carry out your mission. I would also like to express our gratitude to your predecessor for having skilfully and insightfully steered the work of the Assembly at its sixty-second session. I also pay a well-deserved tribute to our Secretary-General  His Excellency Ban Ki-moon  for his commitment to upholding and promoting the ideals of our Organization.   The sixty-third session is being held at a time when the world is facing many challenges. The armed conflicts affecting essentially all continents are compounded by the food  energy and financial crises that endanger the most vulnerable populations. Those recurring crises are genuine handicaps to implementing the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  to which the international community has committed itself.   Chad  like many other countries  found itself early on in an adverse political  social and economic situation  despite the implementation of its national growth and poverty reduction strategy. That strategy  which was updated in 2008  is  however  the best framework for cooperation geared towards pooling all national and international efforts that are essentially aimed at achieving the MDGs. To be sure  the Millennium Declaration was welcomed in its time as a    08-53135 24  major step in the international community’s awareness of the considerable lag of many of its members with respect to development.   The Declaration and the MDGs  which we adopted in 2000 to eradicate poverty by 2015  are today still the most appropriate response to the problems of poverty that many countries  including my own  continue to face. Those problems include shortfalls in terms of the resources necessary to fund our programmes  but also  and particularly  the unrest that has resulted from the many attempts at destabilization and that is worsened by incursions of mercenaries and armed militias of all kinds. The most notable of such incidents took place in April 2006 and February 2008.   To be sure  the development of our oil  which began in 2003  has given the country additional resources. But those resources do not  unfortunately  meet our needs. Outside assistance is therefore necessary in a number of areas in order to build our capacities to better meet the challenges of poverty.   Contributions by our partners — although we would like to reiterate our gratitude to them and commend their commitment to us — need to be adapted. Such contributions should  as a priority  be aimed at building the country’s ability to take action  in particular by developing its natural wealth  and should provide more substantial financial and technical support in that context.   More flexible conditions with respect to easing the external debt of poor countries are indispensable. Greater attention should also be given to the economic problems facing developing countries  specifically those in Africa  where the future of some could be threatened by the lack of competitiveness of their export products because of measures taken by their competitors in the North. My country hopes that the outpouring of solidarity that underpinned the launching of the MDGs process will be revived in order to reduce inequalities  which worsen poverty and which are ultimately sources of tension  with unpredictable consequences. At any rate  Chad continues to be determined to do its utmost to improve the living conditions of its people within the framework of the MDGs.  I would like to commend the efforts of our Organization in eradicating hotspots of tension that are major obstacles to the implementation of development goals. The Darfur crisis is an example of that  due to the burden that it has placed on Chad as a result of its economic  social and environmental repercussions. The presence in eastern Chad of 290 000 Sudanese refugees and 180 000 displaced Chadians is a matter of major concern  for both Chad and for the international community. We welcome the international community’s unprecedented mobilization in that regard.   Nevertheless  the fate of the host populations should be given greater attention  in order to restore the balances that were upset by that massive inflow. In that in that part of the world a true tragedy is occurring  and it weighs on our collective conscience. I would like to issue here a heartfelt appeal for a lasting solution to that crisis.   Furthermore  my country welcomes the extension by the Security Council of the mandate of the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID). Chad is persuaded that the international community  having assessed the suffering of the people of Darfur  will strengthen the operational capacities of UNAMID by providing it with all the appropriate resources so that it can effectively carry out its mission and establish the necessary conditions for a comprehensive and lasting settlement to the crisis.   We believe that it is essential to recall here that  since the crisis broke out in Darfur  my country has spared no effort to assist its Sudanese brothers in finding a peaceful settlement to the conflict facing them. In August 2003  His Excellency Idriss Deby Itno was the first foreign head of State personally to travel to El-Fasher to express his solidarity and support for his Sudanese counterpart  Omer Hassan Al-Bashir  while calling on the Sudanese rebels to lay down their arms and agree to a political settlement. We would recall the decisive role he played as mediator to reach many peace agreements between the Sudanese Government and its opposition.   Similarly  aware of the close linkage between stability in Chad and the settlement of the crisis in Darfur  he has always worked for the normalization of relations between the two countries. It is in that spirit that the Government of Chad welcomed the decision of the Sudan to restore diplomatic relations with Chad at the meeting of the Contact Group tasked with implementing the Dakar Agreement  held in Asmara on 12 September.    25 08-53135   At that time  the Government of Chad called the Contact Group to witness the sincere commitment of the two parties towards a lasting normalization of their relations. Here  I reiterate the gratitude of the Government of Chad to the member countries of the Contact Group  institutions and friendly countries for the key positive roles that they continue to play in supporting Chad and the Sudan on that path.  From this rostrum  we would like to commend the close cooperation among the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic and Chad (MINURCAT)  the European Union-led peacekeeping force and the Government of Chad. The strengthening of the mandate of MINURCAT offers new prospects for developing relations between Chad and the United Nations  taking into account the experience accrued during the preceding mandate. The need for greater effectiveness of the international presence in Chad requires dynamic cooperation between the various parties.  Despite the repeated attacks of mercenaries  the repercussions of which on the life of the nation have been devastating  the Government of Chad  under the impetus of His Excellency Idriss Deby Itno  President of the Republic and Head of State  remains committed to pursuing political dialogue with the democratic opposition and with the armed movements in order to bring about national harmony. The tangible results of that policy are the formation on 23 April 2008 of a broad-based Government  led by Youssouf Saleh Abbas  which includes leading personalities from the democratic opposition. We are also pleased to note the return to legality of several members of the armed movements under the Sirte agreement of 25 October 2007.   We confirm that the political dialogue  initiated by the agreement of 13 August 2007 and briefly interrupted by the tragic events of February 2008  has resumed its work. It is taking place in a climate of trust and understanding and naturally will continue  with the assistance of our partners  towards the holding of free and transparent elections. Here  I would like to reiterate very solemnly to those partners the gratitude of the Government and people of Chad for their valuable support in facilitating that dialogue.  After that overview on national political issues  we would like to address some international challenges facing our Organization.   The setback in the recent negotiations in Geneva raises questions with respect to the ability to establish a just and equitable global trade system that takes into account the legitimate aspirations of developing countries  the most vulnerable in the world economy. What is more  despite the efforts of the international community to reduce tensions and spare the world the horrors of armed conflict  unfortunately we continue to see theatres of confrontation emerge on all continents. The unbearable sight of thousands of women  children and elderly people displaced or cast into exile in the wake of those conflicts should persuade the international community to be more responsible.   Armed conflicts and the atrocities they cause are a breeding ground for terrorism. That scourge is another challenge to and major concern for the international community. My country supports the efforts of the United Nations to fight for its complete eradication  but also for greater justice in addressing international issues.   On issues concerning nuclear matters  we reaffirm our country’s unswerving position  which is to respect the sovereign will of States to acquire nuclear power for civilian purposes.  With respect to conflicts on the African continent  we are pleased to note the joint efforts of the African Union and the United Nations to settle them peacefully and enduringly. Thus  we welcome the normalization of the political and military situation in Côte d’Ivoire  Kenya and the Comoros. In the Horn of Africa  Chad supports the efforts of the African Union to restore peace and national harmony in Somalia. In Zimbabwe  we welcome the political agreement reached between the primary Zimbabwean political players thanks to the mediation of President Thabo Mbeke  to whom we pay well-deserved tribute.   In conclusion  within the framework of reform of the bodies of the United Nations  and more particularly the Security Council  I should like to reiterate the urgent appeal of my country to the Assembly and to the members of the Security Council for a just and fair reform that takes into account the legitimate aspirations of the African continent.

"166",6758,"TGO",63,2008,"Allow me first of all to congratulate Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session. He can count on the full cooperation of the Togolese as he carries out his noble task. We would also like to pay tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  for the insight and determination which he has demonstrated in leading the Organization since taking up his post.  At the high-level meeting on Africa’s development needs  held here on 22 September     08-53129 24  Member States noted that despite the efforts that have been made  the situation in Africa demands continued serious consideration by the international community in order to help Africa face up to the many challenges it faces. It was also stressed that the fight against poverty and the fight for sustainable development cannot succeed without considerable official development assistance and fairer trade between nations.   In that regard  it is unfortunate that the North-South dialogue has been exhausted  as evidenced by the recent failure of the World Trade Organization negotiations in Geneva. Indeed  while international trade should become a tool for development  the balance of global economic power  which was responsible to a great degree for the dependence of countries of the South on their partners in the North  will continue to deteriorate. Most countries perceive globalization as the status quo  which makes the objectives of development and social justice even more difficult to achieve. To think that  when the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) were adopted in 2000  many of us were hopeful that they would be achieved. For that reason we call upon the international community  especially the countries of the North  to respect the commitments made.  We note with concern that today new and even greater challenges are being added to the long list of those which our States already face. The sharp rise in the price of oil and other raw materials  as well as the increasing demand for energy  along with the effects of the global food and financial crises are among these new challenges.  The current food crisis will not fail to have catastrophic consequences if aid to agriculture is not reviewed and increased; it is unfortunate that such assistance was cut by half between 1992 to 2000. It should also be stressed that few resources have been allocated to agricultural infrastructure  to irrigation and to supplying water to the population.  We venture to hope that the new partnership established on 4 June in Rome between the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa  the United Nations  the Food and Agriculture Organization  the International Fund for Agricultural Development and the World Food Programme will contribute to an appropriate response to the situation.  Togo has suffered the negative effects of a long political and economic crisis. However  since President Faure Essozimna Gnassingbé’s accession to power in May 2005  the Togolese Government has sought suitable solutions to the major concerns of the Togolese people by implementing a pragmatic policy based on national reconciliation  poverty reduction and strengthening democracy and the rule of law.  In that context  the head of State worked to conclude a comprehensive political agreement in August 2006  which was signed by the major political parties and which opened the way for the holding of legislative elections in October 2007. There is little need to remind members that those elections took place in a peaceful  transparent and safe environment. They led to the establishment of a broad-based Government and a pluralistic National Assembly  which shows the commitment of the head of State to strengthen the democratization process in an atmosphere of understanding and national unity.  We would like to take this opportunity to reiterate our thanks to the friendly countries and multilateral partners that have fully resumed their cooperation with Togo following the implementation of the agreements signed. In order to consolidate that commitment process  the Togolese Government is working tirelessly to see through the institutional and constitutional reforms provided for by the comprehensive political agreement.  In the legal field  it has undertaken to modernize the justice system  so as to guarantee its independence. In the same vein  national consultations aimed at establishing a Truth  Justice and Reconciliation Commission were launched on 15 April 2008. The Commission will be charged with shedding light on acts of political violence committed in the past and finding ways to compensate the victims. The results of those consultations have just been submitted to the head of State.  Similarly  in its search for better strategies to fight corruption and improve good economic governance  Togo recently signed a memorandum of understanding with the African Peer Review Mechanism  by which it agrees to submit to periodic reviews by the other members of the African Union (AU) and to be directed by the jointly adopted parameters for political  economic and financial governance in Africa. As part of the financial reform    25 08-53129  soon the post of auditor-general and a national audit office will be set up. A Government audit programme is in the process of being finalized.  The torrential rainfall that struck our country last July sorely tested our Government’s efforts. It led to countless human injuries and material and financial losses  including the collapse of a dozen bridges  the flooding of railways and the destruction of roads  villages and fields. That disaster  the second of its kind in a year  makes it very difficult to move from region to region.  The solidarity shown to our country enabled us to assist the affected and to start rebuilding some of the infrastructure. Here  I should like to express our deep gratitude to Ghana  Benin  France  China  the United States of America  Brazil and all the other countries  organizations and institutions that helped us.  As members can see  in spite of our efforts the overall situation in our country is far from satisfactory. Therefore  our country deserves more substantial support. In that regard  the positive results of the Togo Development Partners Conference  held in Brussels on 18 and 19 September  leads us to hope that the international community is ready to play a decisive role in assisting our country to get back on its feet.  We would like once again to express our profound thanks to all those who contributed to the success of that conference  in particular the European Union  France  Germany  the United States of America  Portugal  Nigeria  Burkina Faso  the Niger  the World Bank  the International Monetary Fund  the Islamic Development Bank  the Asian Development Bank  the Central Bank of West African States  the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the West African Economic and Monetary Union.  For decades  Togolese diplomacy has worked to strengthen friendship and cooperation among States and peoples. Thus  at both the bilateral and the multilateral levels  Togo has always done its utmost to achieve the peaceful settlement of disputes with the purpose of maintaining peace and stability wherever threatened. Those actions  undertaken through dialogue and consultation  are part of the efforts made by African countries to ensure better living conditions for their populations. Togo believes that dialogue and consultation must be the preferred ways to settle ethnic  religious or territorial disputes  which are true obstacles to harmonious coexistence among States and peoples.  Along those lines  it must be recalled that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict  which is at the core of the political and security problems in the Middle East  continues to be the focus of the highest concern for the international community. In order to promote peace and stability in that region  the international community must make a greater effort to find a just and lasting peace between Israelis and Palestinians.  In that regard  Togo welcomes the ongoing dialogue between the parties and hopes that the various initiatives will lead to a comprehensive solution  based on the principle of two States  Israeli and Palestinian  living within secure and internationally recognized borders.  Afghanistan and Iraq  which are experiencing a major lack of security  deserve special attention. We therefore call on the international community to increase its assistance to the Governments of those countries in their fight against terrorism  so as to promote peace and reconstruction.  In Africa  while it is true that glimmers of hope are to be seen in the settlement of crises  one cannot but condemn situations such as those persisting in Darfur and Somalia. We call on the various actors to demonstrate more courage and political will to get out of the vicious circle of violence and  thus  give peace a chance.  Because of the orientation of its foreign policy  the Togolese Government endorses all initiatives aimed at preventing  fighting and eliminating the causes of conflict  in particular the trafficking of and illegal trade in small arms. For that reason  it did not hesitate to support the proposal to draft and adopt a binding international instrument on the trade in small arms. Along those same lines  Togo was involved in activities linked to promoting and safeguarding international peace and security  as demonstrated by its participation in the various peacekeeping operations of the United Nations  the African Union and ECOWAS.  Today more than ever  the world needs security and peace in order to devote its energies to eliminating hunger  illiteracy and disease. To that end  it is more urgent than ever to make concerted efforts to fight inequality  injustice and exclusion.    08-53129 26   In our respective countries  we must build societies where humanism and solidarity will reign in peace and security. We believe that that is one of the purposes of the founders of the United Nations and which we must strive to achieve now  at the beginning of the twenty-first century. "
"167",6803,"THA",63,2008,"The attachment that Thailand has had to the ideals and principles that gave birth to the United Nations is long  enduring and natural. From the very first day in this family of nations more than 60 years ago  Thailand  or Siam at that time  made known to all that we stood for peace  for freedom and for tolerance  because peace  freedom and tolerance are part of our national character — a part of who we are. Today  our commitment to peace  freedom and tolerance anywhere and everywhere remains unwavering  and it will remain so.  Therefore  I warmly congratulate Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann  a man of peace  freedom and tolerance  on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session. His cause is our cause  and he can rest assured that the Thai delegation will give him its full support and cooperation.  We are living in a world of enormous opportunities for progress. But we are also living in a world that is in a state of flux  a world that is drifting from one crisis to another. The information technology revolution and transportation advancements have brought people from all corners of the world closer together than ever before. We are now living in a global village  but  sadly  this village is not united as one. This village is deeply divided along political  economic  social  racial  religious and cultural lines. That is not sustainable; it is not healthy. It should not be allowed to go on. All of us have a stake in this. We must not take those divisions for granted or as a given  because they are not.  We need to reclaim the ideal that brought us together in this place: the ideal of “We the peoples”. We need to cultivate and nurture a “we” feeling among us. We must try our best to focus on what binds us together rather than on what keeps us apart. We must be fully aware that to continue to see the world through the glasses of “us versus them” can only lead to confrontation. And confrontation helps no one  because  at the end of the day  in this interconnected globalized world  no one wins everything  but everyone can lose everything. As Mahatma Gandhi once admonished  “An eye for an eye  and soon the whole world is blind”.  We have a choice between progress and self-destruction  between cooperation and confrontation  and between amity and animosity. The choice is for all of us to make  and the choice is clear. There is no better alternative to progress  cooperation and amity among nations and peoples.  The Thai people have made their choice. It is for democracy. The challenge now in Thailand  as in other countries around the world  is to find the right balance between the political culture and the desire for democratic ideals. Nurturing a democratic culture in any country takes time and requires an appreciation of the fact that it is an evolutionary process in which ups    08-53141 28  and downs are to be expected. Thailand’s democratic evolution is no exception.  What is unique about the present state of political evolution in Thailand is the consistent expression of our national character: we stand for peace  for freedom and for tolerance. Indeed  Thai political developments have made a lot of headlines lately. But we trust that good eyes and informed minds will not mistake recent events for the trajectory of a nation. Thai people are resilient people. The Thai society is a resilient society. And Thai people and Thai society are determined to move ahead along the democratic path.  The world has made a choice with respect to development. That choice is embodied in the Millennium Declaration and the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). We are now midway towards 2015  the target year for their realization. While there have been many remarkable and encouraging success stories of progress so far — in reducing poverty  hunger and disease  to name a few — there are also unremarkable and discouraging stories of setbacks. For far too many countries  the realization of the MDGs by 2015 has become increasingly difficult to achieve. Thailand therefore is pleased to see the international community coming together as one in its determination to work harder to help people in each and every country enjoy the fruits of developmental progress and well-being.  To help one another to have a better life is a moral imperative as well as a practical necessity. Can anyone afford to live happily and sleep soundly on an island of opulence in the middle of a sea of poverty and despair? Certainly  the answer is no. It is after all in the enlightened self-interest of every country to ensure that the MDG targets are met — as many and as soon as possible.  Our unity as “We the peoples” is all the more important in the face of the perfect storm that is the global oil crisis  food crisis and financial crisis. These multiple crises threaten to derail the achievements of the MDGs or even to undo hard-won gains of the past in many countries. Developing countries need stability and security in the world energy market. Every dollar hike resulting from speculation on oil price futures being traded on futures market floors means development costs for the Governments of developing countries and affects the livelihoods of ordinary people around the world.  But in every crisis  there exists an opportunity. The exponential rise in oil prices has made it necessary for countries to adapt their patterns of consumption and to rethink their energy security strategies. The global oil crisis has not spared Thailand: our people have been adversely affected by the skyrocketing oil prices in almost every aspect of their lives.  At the same time  Thailand has learned to adapt and adjust. Energy efficiency and the development of alternative energy sources  such as liquefied gas  biofuels and gasohol  are now being pursued with greater urgency. Because of the global oil crisis  more and more vehicles in Thailand today have been shifted to various sources of alternative energy. This market for alternative energy is booming in Thailand and across Asia. There is so much potential in this market  and Thailand stands ready to work together with our friends from around the world in all endeavours pertaining to research in and development of alternative energy.  Developing countries need stability and security in the world food market. In addressing these challenges  we should not forget that the current food crisis has had multiple causes  such as the global oil crisis  drought and flooding. To be effective  any attempt to address this world food crisis must be comprehensive and concerted. It must look at the short-term imperative of keeping the supply flowing in the world market while working towards the longer-term imperative of stabilizing food prices and enhancing productivity.  As a rice bowl of the world  Thailand will continue to ensure a constant supply to the world rice market. We will continue to work with other countries to enhance productivity and ensure food security. In the past  we had an industrial revolution and an information technology revolution. Now  we believe  is the time for the next revolution: a green revolution. We will continue to work with countries around the world to ensure an open international food market and establish agricultural trade rules that help the world’s poor farmers and shore up food security in developing countries. To that end  the Doha Development Round should resume as soon as possible.  Developing countries also need stability and security in the world financial markets. The current turmoil in the world financial markets  if not effectively addressed soon  threatens to cause   29 08-53141  widespread economic downturns than could push millions below the poverty line and severely affect the achievement of the MDGs. To have the world financial crisis piling on top of the world energy and food crises is the last thing that people in the developing countries want to see. That is particularly true for people in Thailand and across Asia. Our painful experience has taught us how phenomena such as those that started off as a financial crisis in 1997 can spiral into a multifaceted crisis that drove millions of people into abject poverty and despair  strained the social fabric of societies and created social tensions that developed into political ones.  We who lived through those dark days do not want to see a repeat of this type of crisis again. All countries therefore have a high stake in the current financial turmoil. We must work together  and quickly  to arrest the downward spiralling effects before it is too late.  Besides the perfect storm of this year’s world energy  food and financial crises  South-East Asia has witnessed a massive storm in the form of Cyclone Nargis  which struck Myanmar in May. Nargis was the most devastating cyclone ever to hit Myanmar. Many lives were lost and many livelihoods were severely affected. But Nargis was not an isolated case. In the past few years  we have witnessed a changing climate pattern that has produced successive monster storms and severe weather in all corners of the world. Ice at the North and South Poles is melting at a frightening speed. Sea level is rising steadily and threatens to engulf low-lying areas around the world. Drought has increased  and many areas  once arable  have turned into desert.  We can no longer turn our eyes away from the gathering threats posed by climate change. These threats recognize no political boundaries. Large and small  powerful and weak  we are all bound together by our common vulnerability and a common destiny as residents of planet Earth. We therefore have a collective responsibility on this issue.  The choice is clear and has been made. When the world gathered to discuss climate change at the Bali Conference in December last year  the world chose collective responsibility over collective irresponsibility. Thailand will spare no effort to work actively with all parties to ensure that the journey that started under the Bali road map last year can be realized at the Copenhagen conference scheduled for next year. This is a critical time that requires critical action by all parties. Time is simply not on our side.  There is a saying that  in every storm  every cloud has a silver lining. That is true for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)  of which Thailand is a member. Faced with the challenge of the aftermath of Cyclone Nargis  ASEAN had to make a choice between doing nothing and losing its credibility  or doing something and being seen as a force to be reckoned with. ASEAN chose the latter. Acting as a bridge between Myanmar and the international community  ASEAN has successfully forged a working tripartite partnership between ASEAN  Myanmar and the United Nations. That partnership has continued to work effectively to this day and could serve as a model for future humanitarian partnerships in other parts of the world. Through that process  ASEAN has once again proven its effectiveness and resilience.  ASEAN has also made another choice — an important and profound one. ASEAN is moving towards being a rules-based and people-centred organization  with the signing of the ASEAN Charter this past year. The upcoming fourteenth ASEAN Summit will take place in Bangkok under the theme “ASEAN Charter for ASEAN peoples” to mark a new era for ASEAN  with people at the heart of our cooperation. As Chairman of ASEAN  Thailand has launched a “three Rs” campaign. First  we want to realize the purposes and vision of the Charter. That includes the realization of an ASEAN human rights body  one of the new organs envisaged in our Charter. Secondly  we will revitalize the people-centred nature of our community in order to enhance their participation in building an ASEAN community. Thirdly  we will reinforce ASEAN cooperation to better contribute to the well-being of our peoples  especially in the areas of human development and security.  Thailand will carry forward the work of the previous ASEAN Chair  Singapore  to realize the dream of the ASEAN founding fathers of transforming South-East Asia from a community of good neighbours into one ASEAN community  where the feeling of “we the peoples of ASEAN” takes root. The world will benefit from having a more rules-based  effective  predictable and people-centred ASEAN as a partner. Through greater integration with the regional countries    08-53141 30  in Asia  ASEAN can become a natural bridge that connects China and India  the two emerging global economic centres of the twenty-first century  with a combined market size of billions of people. We believe that it is not too much or too far-fetched to see a new  modern silk road passing through ASEAN.  Allow me to conclude the same way I started. We need to reclaim the ideals of “We the peoples of the United Nations” in order to work together  to resolve our common problems and to survive. It has never been more imperative for the Members of this Organization to put aside for a moment our narrow self-interest and come together to forge solutions that are in the interest of us all. The United Nations can only be what the collective membership wishes it to be. “We the peoples of the United Nations” have a choice to make.  Let what one astronaut gazing at planet Earth from a space station once said serve to remind us all of our collective responsibility:  “For those who have seen the Earth from space  and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will  the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.” "
"168",6828,"TJK",63,2008,"First of all  allow me to congratulate Mr. D’Escoto Brockmann on his election to the office of President of the General Assembly and to express the hope that  under his leadership  the General Assembly at its sixty-third session will achieve its goals  the most important of which are the further strengthening of the United Nations system for the sake of peace and international security and addressing the global issues that are becoming the challenges of the twenty-first century.  This year  humankind has faced a number of interrelated crises  including the energy  food  climate and financial crises that have combined to cause a general development crisis. The consequences of those newly emerged challenges have had the most severe impact on the social conditions of millions of people in the developing countries and on States with transitional economies  my country among them.  However  people have not lost their hope for a more just and fruitful world. They pin their hopes on a powerful and efficient United Nations capable of mobilizing and focusing its resources on solutions to the most urgent issues of the day. We believe that there is an urgent need to efficiently develop dialogue and cooperation among all the entities of this multipolar world and to avoid applying double standards in international relations. It is equally important not to allow people of different races  religions  continents and regions to be set against one another.  No single country in the world  not even the most powerful  is capable of meeting single-handed the challenges of our time  which range from climate change to the necessary uncompromising fight against international terrorism. Today more than ever before  the new generation of global issues requires a collective response and the United Nations  entrusted with a broad mandate  is the only existing instrument capable of addressing them.  One example of the new generation of global issues is the human right to an adequate food supply. The dramatic rise in the cost of food and energy has    08-51845 2  called into question the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The food crisis has affected the poorest populations in the most negative way. In Tajikistan  93 per cent of whose entire territory is mountainous and only 7 per cent suitable for agriculture  the food crisis has affected two thirds of all households. Additional coordinated efforts and efficient measures are called for if we are to avert a further degradation of the situation of global food security. In the present circumstances  the use of food for biofuel production is inhumane and immoral.  Our hope is that donor States will undertake all the necessary political  financial and economic measures to prevent a worsening of the food crisis. If they do not  millions more could suffer further impoverishment. We also expect that official international assistance will be increasingly allocated to the development of agriculture and that artificially created barriers in trade will eventually be removed.  It is quite obvious that the United Nations should play the key role in addressing the food crisis and related world agricultural policy. Tajikistan supports the activities of the United Nations High-level Task Force on the Global Food Security Crisis mandated to design urgent response measures to the food crisis. The efforts of the Task Force should also be focused on assistance and on developing joint agreed long-term approaches to ensuring food security throughout the world. The High-Level Conference on World Food Security in Rome and the resulting adoption of a declaration were important steps in that direction.  Within the Food and Agriculture Organization  it is necessary to revitalize activities in the transfer of advanced technologies and seeds and in the provision of financial and technical assistance to developing countries. We call for enhanced support for the assistance programmes being implemented through the World Food Programme.  The lives of millions of men  women and children on Earth depend on their ability to exercise their human right to an adequate food supply. That issue requires not protracted discussions  but resolute practical action  since the food crisis  which deprives human beings of their dignity  is no less of a threat than terrorism itself. We believe that the world’s leading countries should act more responsibly to mitigate the consequences of the global energy  food  climate and financial crises  particularly with regard to the poor and developing States  which are most affected by the devastating consequences of those phenomena.  Tajikistan  which has fertile soil and is rich in water resources  can make its own contribution to the resolution of that problem. More than 55 per cent of all water resources in the Central Asia region originate in Tajikistan. Not only is that amount of water sufficient to meet the freshwater needs of agricultural irrigation and related economic sectors in the region; it can also serve as a major source for the generation of ecologically sound electrical energy. Tajikistan’s hydropower capacity  in particular  is estimated at 525 billion kilowatt-hours  and only 5 per cent of that capacity is currently being utilized.  It is only by taking a comprehensive and mutually beneficial approach to the use of hydropower and other natural resources that the States of Central Asia can ensure sustainable development in the region and help to resolve its food and environmental problems  notably through the efficient use of those resources. Only mutually beneficial cooperation aimed at such use can bring well-being to the peoples inhabiting that vast region. We hope that our plans will be supported by the Bretton Woods institutions and by United Nations partners in the private sector.  I believe that we need to create an economic mechanism for the transfer of water and energy resources  which would serve the interests of both upstream countries  which are rich in water resources  and downstream countries  most of which are rich in hydrocarbon raw materials.  The problem of climate change is already affecting our region  in particular its water resources. As a result of global warming  Tajikistan’s glaciers have diminished in size by more than 30 per cent. That has produced low water levels in our rivers over the past three years  which in turn has caused grave social and economic problems by triggering drought  a locust invasion and other difficulties. Without the implementation of hydropower projects  our country will be unable to achieve the MDGs or arrive at sustainable growth  as shown clearly last winter  when weather of unprecedented severity revealed all the difficulties of the transitional period. Next winter and summer are expected to be even more challenging.  Obviously  water is an essential resource  because it is needed not only to sustain human life  but also for industrial purposes  environmental protection and the   3 08-51845  entire development process. Addressing urgent water-related issues and promoting international cooperation in meeting the water challenge are the goals of the International Decade for Action  “Water for Life”  2005-2015  which was initiated by the Republic of Tajikistan. I invite Member States to designate representatives to participate in the International Freshwater Forum  to be held in Dushanbe in 2010  to review the practical implementation of the internationally agreed water agenda.  Despite the many water-related events held throughout the world at various levels in recent years  the issue of water remains urgent. For that reason  in order to ensure that water issues are comprehensively addressed and that efforts taken at the national  regional and global levels are strengthened  the Republic of Tajikistan proposes that a special session of the General Assembly be convened to review progress made in achieving the goals set for the Water Decade and identify areas for further action.  Today  in addition to the general debate  a high-level event on the Millennium Development Goals is being held at United Nations Headquarters. My country regards timely achievement of the MDGs as a priority issue. The Government of Tajikistan has been implementing its national development strategy up to 2015. The strategy  developed at the initiative of the United Nations and with its direct involvement  reflects a largely new approach to development. It takes into account global experience in the area of development  the implementation of similar strategic documents  lessons drawn and conclusions reached during the previous stages of the country’s development  current realities and development prospects. However  I must note that the federal financing of the country’s social progress is limited by the growth rate of our economy.  It is obvious that  in many respects  achievement of the MDGs depends on the approach taken by the international community to the provision of assistance to developing countries and the timely mobilization of internal and external resources. In that respect  Tajikistan associates itself with the appeals made to the donor community to double its development assistance  which is vital for the support of sustainable growth and for the achievement of internationally agreed goals.  The proposal that debts accrued by developing countries be relieved in exchange for the implementation of national projects in the area of sustainable development remains relevant. The soaring costs and  in many cases  artificially inflated prices of hydrocarbon raw materials and food have considerably worsened and complicated the financial situation of poor and developing countries. Even partial cancellation of their debt would help  since it would release funds that could be invested in education and the entire social sector  environmental protection  the fight against HIV/AIDS and other areas.  The forthcoming Follow-up International Conference on Financing for Development to Review the Implementation of the Monterrey Consensus  to be held in Doha  will provide a good opportunity for the further development of effective measures to provide the resources needed to achieve the MDGs. Our hope is that the Doha Conference will provide new impetus for the implementation of the Monterrey Consensus and that it will enhance the spirit of global partnership and solidarity.  The situation in Afghanistan  which has been devastated by a long period of conflict and violence  is a source of grave concern. Afghanistan needs not only a larger military presence on its territory  but also targeted economic  technical and humanitarian assistance. Experience has shown that military action against terrorist groups is often far less effective than carefully thought-out non-violent political and economic measures. We must  as a matter of urgency  realistically consider involving other influential regional actors  including the Shanghai Cooperation Organization  in resolving the Afghan issue.  Strengthening international cooperation in the fight against terrorism is inseparable from counteracting the trade in illicit drugs. It is essential that we assist the Government of Afghanistan in destroying the technological and financing links of the modern illicit-drug industry. Consolidated efforts to that end will enhance the achievement of the goals set out in the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy and the Paris Declaration.  The global system of fighting terrorism  transnational organized crime and illicit drug trafficking which is currently being shaped cannot be built without support from regional organizations. In this regard  Tajikistan salutes the efforts of the United Nations to expand its cooperation with relevant regional organizations. These are powerful structures  and involving them in addressing global issues will    08-51845 4  prevent modern challenges and threats from taking on undesirable dimensions.  The United Nations and peacebuilding are inseparable. We appreciate the devotion of those who selflessly worked at the United Nations Tajikistan Office of Peacebuilding and pay tribute to those who lost their lives while performing their professional duty. The settlement model for the inter-Tajik conflict  involving assistance from the United Nations and guarantor States  has been acknowledged as a unique example of both peacebuilding and preventive diplomacy.  We support the Secretary-General’s initiative to reform the peacekeeping machinery  and we believe that it is essential to continue providing the relevant political  financial and logistical support to peacekeepers in order to help them cope with their difficult missions.  Tajikistan endorses the priority attention given by the United Nations to enhancing the effectiveness of assistance to countries that have endured internal conflicts and supports the activities of the Peacebuilding Commission  which is mandated to contribute to ensuring coordination and enhancing the effectiveness of international assistance to such countries. In order to strengthen peace and stability  countries that have suffered internal conflicts need not only humanitarian assistance but also concrete help in dealing with their economic and social problems  along with support for their efforts to establish the foundation that is essential for a transition to sustainable development.  This year the international community celebrated the 1 150th anniversary of the birth of Abuabdullohi Rudaki  the founder of Tajik-Persian literature. The essence of his moral philosophy can be described as praise for such eternal spiritual values as kindness  beauty  tolerance and mutual assistance. Centuries later  the poetry of Rudaki continues to call for strengthening friendship among nations and expanding dialogue among civilizations; it sings a hymn to humanism and harmony. As noted by the Secretary-General   “Rudaki’s timeless and profound writings provide an inspiration for the Alliance of Civilizations  our initiative to counter extremism and heal the divisions that threaten our world”. (Press release SG/SM/11646)  I am confident that the common human values praised by Rudaki are in harmony with the objectives pursued today by the United Nations worldwide. I am very optimistic about our ability to make the world a better place and to meet the aspirations and hopes of our peoples. "
"169",6850,"TKM",63,2008,"I warmly greet and congratulate the members of the Assembly as we begin our work at the sixty-third session.   First of all  I would like to convey to representatives and the peoples of their countries the wishes for peace and prosperity of His Excellency Gurbanguly Berdymukhammedov  President of Turkmenistan. Allow me to congratulate the esteemed President  Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann  on his election to that high and responsible post and to wish him success in organizing the fruitful work of the General Assembly at this sixty-third session. Allow me also to thank Mr. Srgjan Kerim for his successful leadership of the Assembly at its previous session and for his active collaboration with the delegations.  The United Nations  which is mandated to discuss and resolve issues relating to the maintenance of international peace and security  is currently at one of the most critical moments in its history. That is especially evident against the background of current developments at the global and regional levels. The diversity of contemporary challenges and threats calls for the adequate preparation of a whole range of approaches to prevent them through cooperation among all Member States.   Today  we need solid measures to counter and fight such global challenges as international terrorism  human trafficking  organized crime  illegal drug trafficking and the threat of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. We are also witnessing the effects of climate change and environmental degradation. On top of that  the world community is facing global issues relating to energy and food security.  Turkmenistan is a principled and active participant in the process to identify joint actions aimed at resolving the most pressing problems of our time. In that context  we regard the need to intensify international action to ensure peace and security as a priority task. The fight against terrorism is one of the most important aspects of that problem.  Turkmenistan  as a party to major United Nations instruments to combat international terrorism and organized crime  supports the Organization’s efforts to develop a global strategy to fight terrorism and stands ready to provide its practical assistance to the international community in that regard.  The non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is a pressing issue on the international agenda that is connected with ensuring peace and security. Our country plays an active role in identifying non-proliferation measures and takes practical steps for their implementation at the national and international levels. As a party to the Treaty on the    08-53135 4  Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and other very important international legal instruments in that sphere  Turkmenistan has joined international initiatives aimed at preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.  In that connection  the signing of the Treaty on a Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in Central Asia  which was prepared and adopted under the aegis of the United Nations in 2006  has become an important element in the efforts of the world community to resolve the issue.  Today  we must all take a fresh look at the existing system for maintaining international peace and security. The current situation and emerging trends call for an adequate approach and the formulation of comprehensive measures  and the community of nations should take part in their implementation. I am confident that ongoing discussions and deliberations at this session will provide us with an opportunity to take stock of the entire panorama of the contemporary world through the prism of ensuring a safe life for States and peoples.   Undoubtedly  the General Assembly will help to consolidate efforts of Member States for the effective implementation of such measures. Turkmenistan supports close cooperation with the United Nations in adopting comprehensive measures for collective interaction to address the most pressing issues of our times. In that connection  we believe it necessary to consider qualitatively new factors in ensuring security.   Energy security has become an integral component of the global security system. The availability and accessibility of fuel and energy resources  their free delivery to international markets and effective use by consumers have become major factors in the development of the world economy as a whole.   As a major oil and natural gas producer  Turkmenistan holds a prominent place in the global energy system. In that connection  we take a highly responsible approach to developing international cooperation on the basis of our national interests and the needs of our partners. Turkmenistan’s policy  of diversifying supplies of hydrocarbon materials and ensuring energy security has become an important factor in that approach. It is apparent that major investments are needed to develop an effective and stable system of global energy security and that a considerable share of those investments should be directed towards the transportation of hydrocarbons and the protection of energy infrastructure. In order to ensure adequate supplies to the world energy markets  we will also need a highly developed infrastructure of international pipeline networks.  At the same time  ensuring energy security is not simply a matter of increasing the pace of hydrocarbon extraction  developing new deposits or expanding the infrastructure for transporting and delivering energy supplies to end users. We must take into account other factors of that system  such as political stability  the situation in world markets and the presence of security guarantees for international pipelines.   Adequate security for energy infrastructure facilities also implies a decrease in their vulnerability to the impact of natural and man-made disasters  potential risks connected to changes in the military and political situation in certain regions of the world  threats from international terrorists  and the unauthorized siphoning of transported energy resources. Such problems often interrupt or reduce supplies of fuel  in particular oil and natural gas  and result in major financial losses and higher prices for energy supplies  with a negative impact on the development of the world economy.  Therefore  it has become increasingly urgent to coordinate the efforts of States to establish a unified system of energy security. To that end  we must develop an appropriate international legal framework and effective partnership mechanisms  including for the protection of energy transportation systems. It appears that this problem affects us all  be they energy producers  transit countries or consumers.  On that basis  Turkmenistan has launched an initiative aimed at elaborating  under United Nations auspices  a unique document defining the legal basis and security guarantees for the functioning of international pipelines. As a preliminary step towards implementing that initiative  Turkmenistan has prepared a draft resolution on the reliability of energy transit and its role in ensuring stable economic development and international cooperation  which is being proposed for consideration at the sixty-third session of the Assembly. Support for that draft resolution may provide a good stepping stone for the future and demonstrate the principled readiness of the world community seriously to resolve those issues. In that context  Turkmenistan is prepared to organize in   5 08-53135  2009 an international conference on that problem under United Nations auspices in Ashgabat  our country’s capital.  This year has witnessed an important event in the life of Central Asia that  I believe  may have a considerable positive impact on the situation in the region. I mean by that the commencement of the functioning of the United Nations Regional Centre for Preventive Diplomacy for Central Asia. The inauguration of the Centre gave an impetus to the new stage of strategic partnership of Central Asian countries with the United Nations in undertaking a set of measures aimed at preventing conflicts and eliminating their underlying causes.  We consider the inauguration of the Centre as testimony of the great attention that the world community devotes to the processes occurring in Central Asia  clear understanding of the role and importance of our region in global international affairs and a desire to provide utmost positive assistance in tackling regional problems. In the long run  that activity will be aimed at achieving the long-term goal of ensuring the security  stability and sustainable development of the States and peoples of the Central Asian region.  Moreover  we believe that close interaction of neighbouring countries is one of the most decisive factors. In that context  by closely adhering to its international obligations as a permanently neutral State  Turkmenistan stands for developing good-neighbourly cooperation with all the countries of the region.  In that connection  Turkmenistan provides economic and humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan and actively supports the efforts of the international community to restore peaceful life in that fraternal country. We would like to see Afghanistan as a peaceful and prosperous nation  a good neighbour and partner of all the States in the region.  The issue of the Caspian Sea has acquired special relevance in the context of regional stability and economic cooperation. Moreover  its comprehensive consideration envisages the solution of problems relating to the establishment of an international legal basis for cooperation  as well as large-scale development of the geo-economic potential of the Caspian region as a major energy basin and transportation crossroads between East and West  South and North. For some States in the region that do not have direct access to international sea communications  the Caspian Sea is the most important route to the world markets.  In that regard  effective activity in the Caspian Sea is directly linked to the enhancement of security in the adjacent region. Turkmenistan advocates that the Caspian area should be a zone of peace  stability and effective international cooperation on the basis of mutual respect and a partnership of equality.  Being an integral part of the international community  Turkmenistan sees its future in the development of a truly democratic society  in which every individual person  his or her rights and freedoms and the all-round development of his or her potential represent the main value and measure of the country’s progress. Just a few days ago  Turkmenistan witnessed a major political event — the adoption of the new version of its constitution  which laid down the legal basis for the development of national statehood and the further democratization of social life. In particular  the constitution considerably broadens the powers of the parliament as the country’s main legislative body. In addition  it expands the role of local bodies of government and self-government  in whose work citizens take an active part on a broad representative basis.   Democratization is a natural process of development of any State and society  and in that connection  the strengthening of a democratic  secular and law-based State is our own conscientious sovereign decision  and we will steadfastly follow this course.  The foreign policy of Turkmenistan is determined by the national interests of our State and its people  and its main goal is civilized development on the basis of positive integration into global political and economic processes. Therefore  cooperation with the United Nations is the strategic direction of our foreign policy  and the principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter serve for us as the basis for the development of Turkmenistan’s relations with other States.  We view the United Nations as a universal international organization  serving as the main guarantor of the global security system and the framework of the present and future world order. We advocate that international law and the United Nations Charter and their principles of respect for the sovereignty of every nation and its choice of its own    08-53135 6  way of development and non-interference in internal affairs should remain the basis of the world order and the alpha and omega of relations among nations.  On that basis  Turkmenistan determines its view to its partnership with the United Nations and states its interest in strengthening and expanding its role in the system of international relations  especially with regard to the consolidation of the efforts of Member States to ensure peace and security on Earth. "
"170",6863,"TLS",63,2008,"First of all  I would like to congratulate Mr. d’Escoto Brockmann on his well-deserved election to preside over the sixty-third session of the General Assembly. The sustained increase in the cost of energy  the growing demand for oil by industrialized countries and emerging economies  higher food prices  the lack of arable land and water in many regions and climate change are only some of the indicators of non-conventional threats to security that we all face today and increasingly in the future.   But crises also offer opportunities. Throughout the decades  hundreds of millions of people all over the world abandon their ancestral lands and move to cities in search of work and a better life  as Governments focus their attention and resources on cities and neglected rural populations. But as urban populations swell in numbers  the dream of a better life is turning into desperation. However  the twenty-first century may witness their return to their places of origin  if Governments can learn from this crisis and seriously invest in job creation programmes for rural areas  particularly in agriculture  in order to increase food production.  Increasing food costs  whatever the cause may be  are neutralizing the progress achieved in many developing countries towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. If the international community does not redouble and coordinate its efforts to significantly boost development assistance and market access  it will be nearly impossible for poor  non-oil-producing countries to achieve even the modest goals that we had set for them in 2001 with a view to reducing poverty in the world by half by 2015. Donor countries must quickly readapt their aid for development  emphasizing agriculture  particularly in support of small family and community projects  preservation of land and rainwater recovery  by increasing the percentage of official development assistance (ODA) from a modest 3 per cent in 2006 to at least 30 per cent. I note that in 1980  the percentage of all foreign aid dedicated to agriculture was 17 per cent  which had dropped to 2.9 per cent by 2006. Timor-Leste accordingly supports the initiative of the Secretary-General to establish a High-Level Task Force on the Global Food Security Crisis and an integrated framework in order to deal with immediate food needs worldwide and to provide the most vulnerable countries with the capacity they need to become self-sufficient.  As a newly independent country  Timor-Leste has benefited much from the generosity of the international community. Donors will say that they have contributed hundreds of millions of dollars to my country in the last few years  and that is true. However  we must ask ourselves if the aid has helped to improve the lives of the majority of our population. The answer is yes and no. But we all could do better if the bulk of the aid was not used to cover the costs of the endless study missions and redundant reports  but was invested on the ground in small rural development initiatives. (spoke in English)  Timor-Leste is a least developed country. However  Almighty God has bestowed on us some modest oil  gas and other mineral wealth. Our oil and gas revenues are modest  averaging only $100 million to $150 million a month. It could be argued that  for a country of slightly over one million people  this amount is not too bad. By the end of this year  our Petroleum Fund  which was established in 2005  will have accumulated in excess of $3 billion  all invested in United States treasury bonds. A writer in The Economist recently stated that those who invest in United States treasury bonds are people who like to lose money. We may be among them. We agree with that remark  and Timor-Leste is seeking to reinvest our modest revenues in diversified portfolios around the world.  While our first obligation is to make use of our oil wealth for the sustainable development of our country and to address the immediate needs of our poorest  we are not indifferent to the suffering of our fellow human beings in other parts of the world. When the Asia region was hit in December 2005 by a tsunami of major proportions  our Government immediately contributed $50 000 for the victims in Indonesia  and   9 08-51851  our citizens took up their own collection of donations and raised an additional $70 000.  Now  in response to several natural disasters that have affected tens of millions of our fellow human beings  Timor-Leste promptly decided to donate $500 000 for the victims of the earthquake that hit the Chinese province of Sichuan; $500 000 for the victims of Cyclone Nargis that hit Myanmar on 2 May  to be channelled through the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Secretariat; and $500 000 for Cuba to assist the victims of Hurricanes Gustav and Ike  to be channelled directly to the Cuban authorities. Starting in 2009  Timor-Leste will contribute $1 million annually to assist child-related programmes in Myanmar and Somalia through United Nations agencies like UNICEF and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).  We believe that  even though we are poor  or because we are poor  we should better understand and feel the pain of the poorest of the poor and must be among the first to help others less fortunate than us.  In my address today  I shall touch upon three international issues: Myanmar  the United States embargo against Cuba and the question of Western Sahara.  Timor-Leste’s stance on Myanmar is aligned with the stance taken by our immediate neighbours in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. We believe in particular that while strong denunciations of abuses are justifiable and that sanctions might be morally justifiable  there cannot be a long-term solution in Myanmar without the consent and full partnership of that country’s army. Hence  the challenge for those involved is to persuade the military that their own interests as a group will not be compromised in any future democratic arrangement. Any other strategy seeking to sideline the military or that the military sees as undermining their power and future safety will not succeed and will only prolong the agony of all in that sad country.  Hurricanes Gustav and Ike  which brought devastation to the Caribbean  ruined the Cuban economy. The country’s material losses are staggering  with initial estimates showing the losses to approach a total of at least $5 billion. Timor-Leste has nearly 700 East Timorese medical students in Cuba  and over 140 East Timorese are studying medicine in our national university with Cuban medical instructors. In addition  there are nearly 300 Cuban doctors working in our country  distributed through all districts and sub-districts. Cuban adult education specialists assist us in our adult literacy campaign  benefiting thousands of adults. The costs of those programmes are borne almost entirely by Cuba.  Mr. Siles Alvarado (Bolivia)  Vice-President  took the Chair.  While I commend the United States and any country that stands for universal democratic values and that provides moral support for those promoting democracy in their own countries  I submit that punitive measures imposed on poor developing countries for the perceived sins of their leaders cannot be morally justified.  As a friend of the United States  I humbly appeal to its next Administration and to Congress to lift the embargo against Cuba. Such a gesture would be honourable  and my admiration for the United States would only increase. As it is  as I witness the impact of United States sanctions on a small developing country  as well as its refusal to provide unconditional assistance to Cuba following the devastation caused by Hurricanes Gustav and Ike  my heart bleeds in sorrow and my admiration for the United States seriously diminishes. In that connection  I wish to express once again our most heartfelt sympathy and solidarity with the people of Haiti and others in the Caribbean region who were affected by the recent natural disasters.  With regard to the situation in Western Sahara  Timor-Leste is guided by the stance taken by the regional organization that is most competent on this matter — the African Union — and guided by the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council and the Advisory Opinion of the International Court of Justice  all of which clearly and unequivocally recognize the inalienable right of the people of Western Sahara to self-determination. That is the core of the issue and the root cause of the ongoing conflict. Hence  Timor-Leste joins with the African Union in calling for strict respect for the inalienable right of the Saharawi people to self-determination.  I now turn to the situation in my own country. On 11 February  I was shot and nearly died as a result. I escaped by an act of God and thanks to the professionalism and dedication of doctors and nurses at the Australian army medical centre in Dili and the    08-51851 10  doctors and nurses at the Royal Darwin Hospital. To them  and to all who have prayed for my life and my recovery  I once again express my eternal gratitude. I stood at the frontier between life and death; I saw the darkness of death and the beauty of life  which I nearly left behind.  The attack against Prime Minister Gusmão and myself shocked the nation  and my near-death served to unite the people in opposing violence. Since then  the situation in Timor-Leste has been more peaceful than it has been in many years  without any politically motivated violence so far; even common crime has been significantly reduced. The Government  led by Mr. Gusmão  a resistance hero  has made enormous efforts in stabilizing the country and delivering services to the people. Progress is visible. A growing number of internally displaced persons are returning home. Most camps are now empty. More than 700 former soldiers involved in the 2006 mutiny have accepted a Government financial package and have returned home.  On the economic front  our real gross domestic product (GDP) will show a 7 per cent increase by the end of this year. However  if oil and gas revenues are factored in  our economic growth will be approximately 19 per cent. While our real annual GDP per capita is less than $400  that figure jumps to more than $4 000 if oil and gas revenues are factored in. However  we would not have succeeded in pulling back from the brink without the prompt and steadfast support of the international community. I thank the Secretary-General and  through him  the entire United Nations family  in particular those serving in my country in various capacities  for their selfless contributions to the preservation of peace in Timor-Leste.  I also thank Australia and New Zealand for maintaining a robust and credible security force in my country in support of  and in close coordination with  our Government and the United Nations Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste  under the leadership of Mr. Atul Khare  Special Representative of the Secretary-General  who is a most compassionate human being and a dedicated and tireless professional.  The professionalism of the International Security Forces is visible to all  and the behaviour of the soldiers is irreproachable. The same can be said of the United Nations police force in my country  comprising police from 40 countries  with particular reference to formed police units from Portugal  Pakistan  Malaysia and Bangladesh. We are blessed by the Almighty with non-negligible resources  and we can count on the generosity of our development partners  but challenges remain complex and multifaceted. However  I am confident that  with a shared vision and a commitment to serve the poorest of the poor  we will meet the Millennium Development Goals. We cannot fail. We shall not fail. "
"171",6879,"TON",63,2008,"I would like to join previous speakers in offering Mr. d’Escoto Brockmann my warm congratulations on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly.  As this is first time that I am here to address this Assembly  whose main objectives include the promotion of democracy and economic self-reliance  I am happy to record that the Kingdom of Tonga has been undertaking some historical and fundamental economic and political reforms over the past few years.  Eight years ago  the United Nations adopted the historic Millennium Declaration  offering new hope to people living in poverty around the world. Yesterday we met to review the progress we have made to date. This midterm review provides us with yet another opportunity to assess our overall achievements  draw attention to the constraints and gaps and renew our political commitment to the achievement of the targets that we set for the year 2015.  While some progress has been made globally in regard to poverty reduction  there is yet much more work to be done. Hardship and poverty have traditionally not been an issue of serious concern in the Kingdom of Tonga  but they are now becoming one. External influences are changing people’s attitudes and aspirations  straining the traditional Tongan social system in which everyone’s needs were met by the community as a whole.  A recent study has found that although there are no families living in absolute poverty  there is a small proportion of the population living in hardship. Population growth  changes in lifestyle and the gradual breakdown of the traditional social and family systems have contributed to those increased hardships. But the main cause has been our lack of foresight  drive and determination to retain much of that traditional spirit of self-reliance and self-sufficiency that has served us well for centuries. That is the main challenge for Tonga today — to be more self-reliant and more self-sufficient  given the natural resources readily available to us within our own national borders.  The main theme of the general debate this year — the impact of the global food crisis on poverty and hunger in the world — is most timely. We all should look upon this crisis as an opportunity to redouble our efforts and refocus on policy actions that would help boost agricultural production in order to build greater self-reliance and self-sufficiency. Development aid can assist  but in the long term there is no substitute for a more dynamic and productive agricultural sector. Greater self-reliance is the ultimate goal for which Kingdom of Tonga strives.  Tonga’s performance under the United Nations Human Development Index continues to reflect a high level of expenditure and investment in the social sectors  including health and education. The United Nations Human Development Report for 2008 ranks Tonga 55 out of a total of 177 countries. Tonga has achieved targets such as universal primary education and gender equality through the provision of free primary school education.  Tonga shares the concern that the President expressed about the impact of climate change on small island States. In his prepared remarks for his opening statement on assuming the presidency last week  he emphasized that the negotiations process on agreed long-term actions initiated in Bali “must be guided by a single consideration: saving those small island States that today live in danger of disappearing entirely as nations. This is the real challenge of our day and this should be our immediate concern.”  And so it should be. For already  the prospect of climate refugees from some of the Pacific Island Forum countries is no longer merely a prospect but a reality  with relocations of communities already being relocated due to the rise in sea level. Urgent action must be taken now.  Last month in Niue  the leaders of the Pacific Island Forum countries endorsed  for the first time  a regional declaration on climate change as part of the Forum’s communiqué. The Niue Declaration duly recognizes the serious current impact of climate change and the growing threat it poses to economic  social  cultural and environmental well-being as well as to the security of Pacific island countries. Therefore  the Pacific small island developing States will introduce a draft resolution entitled “Climate change and security” during the current session of the General Assembly. I commend the draft resolution to Member States for their consideration and support.  Tonga welcomes the resources and technical assistance that will become available through initiatives such as Japan’s Cool Earth Promotion Programme  the European Union’s Global Climate   33 08-52265  Change Alliance  Australia’s National Climate Adaptation Programme for the Pacific and the increase in New Zealand’s financial support for climate change adaptation.  This year marks the tenth anniversary of the normalization of relations between Nuku’alofa and Beijing. This milestone has reaffirmed Tonga’s commitment to the observance of the One China policy  with the state of relations and economic cooperation between our two countries continuing to flourish and prosper.  Tonga welcomes the reform process and debates under way in international institutions. We share the view that the United Nations has a unique role and legitimacy and acknowledge the reforms that are occurring to strengthen the coherence of the United Nations system and  in particular  the efficacy of its development and humanitarian activities. It is vital that the United Nations contribute to developing a global framework of rules and collective action in an inclusive and democratic manner. As a member of the Commonwealth  Tonga joined others in Kampala in 2007  and most recently in London earlier this year  in expressing concern that the current architecture of international institutions does not respond adequately to the challenges facing the small island States and environmental governance.  The longstanding debate on the reform of the Security Council  now over 10 years old  remains fraught with uncertainty and an inability to reach agreement on improving fundamental aspects of the Council  including the questions of equitable representation and an increase in its membership. In our opinion  the forthcoming intergovernmental negotiations present a further opportunity for Member States to advance this debate to a successful conclusion. Tonga continues to maintain its support for Japan’s proper and permanent place in any enhanced Council.  Last year from this podium  we provided details of how our Legislative Assembly approved a timetable for the implementation of reforms by 2010  leading to greater democratization of our political system.  His Majesty King George Tupou V is the driving force guiding the political reform process on which we have embarked as a nation. He holds the view that the monarchy is an instrument of change and not an obstacle to it. He has for some years  therefore  encouraged the Government to take the necessary measures to bring about a more democratic form of government  one in line with the aspirations of his people and with the changing circumstances of our globalized world.  In July this year  royal assent was granted to the Constitution and Electoral Commission Act of 2008. Its main task is to consider the constitutional and electoral implications of the resolutions of the Legislative Assembly and to draft the necessary bills for consideration and enactment.  Tonga was the first Pacific State to present its national report at the second session of the Human Rights Council’s Universal Periodic Review earlier this year. I wish to thank New Zealand for assisting in the funding of the preparation of the report and also those Member States who took the opportunity to contribute constructively to the review dialogue on the human rights situation in Tonga  as well as those who made pledges of financial and technical support.  In our globalized world  no sovereign nation can achieve its goals of progress  peace and security on its own  and that includes the Kingdom of Tonga. Constructive and active engagement in regional and international affairs through bilateral and multilateral cooperation mechanisms  with the United Nations at the centre  and greater  yet appropriate  integration into the global economy will thus continue to be the cornerstone of Tonga’s foreign policy.  As a Member of the United Nations  Tonga wishes to reaffirm its commitment to continuing its active involvement in the work of the United Nations as the central body coordinating the common efforts of the family of nations to which we all belong."
"172",6919,"TTO",63,2008,"I am honoured to be afforded the opportunity to address the General Assembly at its sixty-third session. I also wish to extend my sincere congratulations to Mr. D’Escoto Brockmann on his election to the presidency. I am convinced that his wealth of experience  garnered over the years in the different capacities in which he has served and his strong conviction of the importance of multilateralism and respect for international law  will be brought to bear in a most positive and productive way on the proceedings of the session. Further  Trinidad and Tobago is gratified that Nicaragua and  by extension  Central America  has been graced with the distinct honour of guiding the work of the sixty-third session.  At the same time  my delegation wishes to express our heartfelt appreciation and admiration for the way in which His Excellency Srgjan Kerim of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia conducted the affairs of the General Assembly during the last session.  The Secretary-General must be commended  particularly for his untiring efforts in ensuring that humanitarian relief is brought to thousands of victims of natural disasters  including in the Caribbean. Given the increasing frequency and ferocity of hurricanes and other similar climatic phenomena  there is dire need for the provision of early warning systems and capacity-building programmes in vulnerable regions like the Caribbean  aimed at enhancing planning and preparedness and at mitigating the effects of such disasters. We applaud all efforts to bring relief to those affected.  The President returned to the Chair.  The recent disasters bring into sharp focus the imperative of purposeful action on the problems of climate change at the national  regional and international levels. Trinidad and Tobago is committed to adopting concrete measures aimed at reducing its levels of greenhouse gas emissions  while at the same time promoting balanced industrialization and environmental sustainability.  Notwithstanding its current healthy endowment of hydrocarbon resources  Trinidad and Tobago recognizes the need to promote clean energy alternatives  the development of new and renewable energy options and the proper protection and management of the nation’s forests. Indeed  the Government is putting into effect appropriate policies for substantial results in that area. We hope to achieve meaningful progress  in cooperation with development partners within the public and private sectors  both locally and internationally  and with civil society.  Cooperation at the international level is also indispensable to efforts aimed at addressing the current energy crisis. Trinidad and Tobago is seeking to partner with its African friends in order to  among other things  identify ways of developing long-term strategies for the sustainable development and utilization of their energy resources. That is in keeping with the pledge made by The Honourable Patrick Manning  Prime Minister of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago  in 2007  when he addressed the eighth Summit of the African Union  in Ethiopia. Since then  discussions have ensued with individual African States and with the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)  to advance the initiative. The Government of Trinidad and Tobago is eager to work assiduously towards the attainment of our common objectives.  Trinidad and Tobago firmly believes that the United Nations must take the lead in the management of the global food crisis  in which we are confronted with a situation of losing thousands to hunger on an almost daily basis. We embrace the various multilateral initiatives to address that grave challenge  including the establishment by the Secretary-General of the High-Level Task Force on the Global Food Security Crisis in April 2008 and the adoption of its Comprehensive Framework for Action.  The eradication of extreme poverty and hunger is one of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) to be achieved by 2015. We cannot allow the threat posed by the global food crisis to reverse the strides made so far by many developing countries to achieve that Goal. We must utilize all the resources at our disposal  including a recommitment to the Food and Agriculture   27 08-53129  Organization of the United Nations (FAO)  which was established to help developing countries and countries in transition modernize and improve agriculture and fisheries practices and to ensure good nutrition for their citizens. We must work in concert to provide that institution with the resources necessary to discharge effectively its mandates. If we fail to win the war against that common enemy  we will be compromising the right to food and by extension the right to life of millions of people.  The Government of Trinidad and Tobago has embraced a number of key policy initiatives that are designed to guarantee our citizens access to food of sufficient quality and quantity and to reduce the impact of the food crisis. Thousands of acres have been made available for diversified agricultural production. In addition  capital is accessible to farmers through our national Agricultural Development Bank.  Trinidad and Tobago recognizes that food security must also be pursued in the context of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) Single Market and Economy  which provides the opportunity for the integration of production and cross-border investment in agricultural production in those countries which have greater agricultural potential and resources. The Government of Trinidad and Tobago therefore hosted  jointly with the CARICOM secretariat and the Food and Agriculture Organization  a regional agriculture donor conference in June 2007.  Similarly  like poverty and hunger  terrorism remains a major scourge on our societies and poses a direct threat to democratic institutions. It undermines the rule of law  infringes human rights and generally affects the well-being of its victims. Trinidad and Tobago is convinced that members of the international community must embrace multilateral solutions in the fight against terrorism. We remain committed to the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy  which is complementary to our own efforts to combat terrorism.  Trinidad and Tobago views the reform of the Security Council as indispensable to the transformation and further democratization of the United Nations. As a small island developing State  Trinidad and Tobago wishes to reiterate its position on Security Council reform  which emphasizes the need for  among other things  equity of access for small States to the Security Council and the need for representation of all regions of the world in its permanent membership. Failure to reform the Security Council could serve to undermine that organ’s authority as the body with the primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security  as well as its ability to discharge its other obligations under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations.  Trinidad and Tobago is convinced that the United Nations remains the principal vehicle for meaningful exchanges between members of the international community on matters of international concern. Such deliberations  in our view  constitute the bedrock of the democratization of the United Nations system and are for us a priority consideration. We recognize therefore the great value of the informal consultations on system-wide coherence aimed at making the Organization deliver as one.  Further progress on that issue during the current session is imperative for the United Nations development system to be able to provide Member States  particularly developing countries  with the assistance required to achieve the Millennium Development Goals and the other internationally agreed development goals.  The Government of Trinidad and Tobago has charted a development policy to achieve the MDGs within the stipulated period  as well as to transform the country to developed status by the year 2020. The pace of economic growth over the past decade has fortunately enabled us to surpass MDG targets in achieving universal primary education  promoting gender equality  empowering women and significantly reducing the level of poverty.  Trinidad and Tobago’s development strategy exceeds the MDG targets in some respects. The Government of Trinidad and Tobago has been able to provide free secondary and tertiary education to its citizens. In addition  30 per cent of our cabinet ministers and members of parliament are women.  Regrettably  for many developing States  the achievement of the MDGs within the stipulated period appears to be elusive. We therefore urge all development partners to honour their commitments and pledges already agreed upon.  Another important international process to which Trinidad and Tobago attaches great importance is the review of the implementation of the Monterrey    08-53129 28  Consensus on Financing for Development  which will be addressed at a follow-up international conference in Doha  Qatar  in November. The Monterrey Consensus  adopted by heads of State or Government in 2002  called for the mobilization of resources to assist developing countries in meeting the MDGs and recognized the importance of coherence and consistency within and among the international monetary  financial and trading systems in support of overall development. While there have been some advances under the key pillars of financing for development  they have not been sufficiently far-reaching. In the light of the current financial crisis  the timing for the convening of the follow-up conference is most timely and presents an opportunity for the forging of global partnerships in a spirit of solidarity. A key component for success will be an ongoing engagement between Governments and all stakeholders  including the private sector and civil society.  Trinidad and Tobago is committed to the regional integration movement of CARICOM and has continued to provide economic assistance to our CARICOM partners within the ambit of that multilateral framework and other bilateral arrangements. One such arrangement is Trinidad and Tobago’s Petroleum Development Fund  a facility that only recently was drawn upon to provide substantial assistance to some of our Caribbean neighbours in the aftermath of recent hurricanes. Another is the CARICOM Trade Support Programme  a comprehensive loan facility of $16.5 million that is aimed at improving the trade capacity of CARICOM States by providing assistance in the diversification of their economies and in improving trade capacity.  The Caribbean also falls prey to the nefarious trade in narcotics  to which the illegal proliferation of small arms and light weapons is linked. In an effort to confront these challenges  we have concluded with our neighbours the CARICOM Maritime and Air Space Security Cooperation Agreement to protect our borders from illegal activities. We recognize  however  the important role of the United Nations as the premier multilateral forum in providing assistance in areas such as capacity-building to augment our own resources. For the States of the Caribbean  a critical aspect of disarmament is the eradication of the illegal trade in small arms. Trinidad and Tobago therefore calls for urgent action to complete the work on the elaboration of an arms trade treaty.  In the context of our efforts to address the challenge  we also wish to call again for consideration to be given to the inclusion of international drug trafficking as one of the crimes within the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court (ICC).  It is of great significance to us that the very year we celebrate the tenth anniversary of the adoption of the Rome Statute of the ICC  we also commemorate the sixtieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Since its establishment  the ICC has been able to attract 100 States parties  issue arrest warrants and begin trials of persons accused of committing crimes of major concern to the international community. The perpetrators of genocide  crimes against humanity and war crimes show flagrant disregard for the human rights of their victims  as well as for human rights law and humanitarian law  none of which should go unpunished.  The United Nations has played a seminal role in the promotion and development of international law  which has contributed to the maintenance of international peace and security and friendly relations among States. As a small State  Trinidad and Tobago views adherence to and respect for the rule of law as a bulwark against intrusions that could affect our territorial integrity  independence and economic development and the general well-being of our citizens. However  we are conscious of the need for international cooperation in the implementation of international legal obligations under various conventions that provide mutual benefits to Member States.  One area of which the United Nations can be justly proud is the conclusion of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. The Convention has worked well since its adoption and entry into force  and it has provided legal certainty to activities carried out by States in different maritime zones. In keeping with our obligations under the Convention  Trinidad and Tobago is in the process of completing work on its submission to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf by May 2009 to extend its continental shelf jurisdiction beyond 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured. We do so with full respect   29 08-53129  for the sovereign right of other coastal States to make similar submissions to the Commission.  Our region is home to the International Seabed Authority  which is located in Jamaica. The Authority’s mandate is derived from the Convention  and it is entrusted with the responsibility to administer the resources of the International Seabed Area  which is the common heritage of mankind. As in previous years  we again call on all members of the Authority to make every effort to attend its meetings.  In conclusion  Trinidad and Tobago wishes to reaffirm its faith in and commitment to multilateralism at the regional  hemispheric and international levels. Dialogue among States must always be the preferred option for solving the myriad problems that we face in an increasingly complex international environment. It is in recognition of this importance that Trinidad and Tobago has taken the bold decision to host in 2009 both the Summit of the Americas and the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. Dialogue in those two bodies  which are microcosms of the United Nations  could also influence discussions at the United Nations  an institution that we must continue to transform  guard and protect  in order to be able to bequeath it to future generations.

"173",6966,"TUN",63,2008,"I wish at the outset to sincerely congratulate you  Sir  on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session. We are convinced that your diplomatic ability and skill will help us to ensure the success of this session and to attain the objectives to which we all aspire. I should also like to thank Mr. Srgjan Kerim for his excellent work and his valuable contributions to the smooth conduct of the previous session. Our sincere thanks go also to the Secretary-General  Mr. Ban Ki-moon  for his generous efforts to promote the work of the Organization and to enhance its performance in addressing various issues of importance to our countries and peoples.  The choice of the main theme of this year’s general debate — the impact of the global food crisis on poverty and hunger in the world — reflects the importance of that issue and the growing awareness among all countries of its seriousness and of the need to work together to find effective solutions to reduce its impact and repercussions on national economies  particularly those of developing and poor countries  and on the increasing rates of poverty and hunger throughout the world.  In that context  the central role played by the United Nations is of crucial importance in addressing those issues and in striving to achieve a better balance in international relations and greater solidarity  justice and equality. That requires that we enhance the   5 08-53129  Organization’s reform process and strengthen its capacity to keep abreast of international developments.  In recent years  the world situation has been characterized by increasingly swift change  which has disrupted international balances and undermined prevailing development formulas. It has also created many problems and difficulties that have clearly affected the economies and development processes of many countries. In addition  it has weakened their capacity to make progress and increased their vulnerability. Furthermore  the world has recently witnessed serious economic problems  in particular an excessive rise in oil and basic food prices  which has threatened world food security and reduced the purchasing power of individuals  thus hampering the achievement of the goals and approaches set at the Millennium Summit. If we are to address this grave situation  we must step up international efforts by adopting development strategies based on the noble human aspects of world solidarity. In that context  Tunisia has called on international financial institutions and other organizations that specialize in economy and trade to establish and implement agricultural and production policies that guarantee the availability of food  which is a fundamental right enshrined in international human rights instruments.  I should like to take this opportunity to reiterate our call for intensified efforts to operationalize the World Solidarity Fund  endorsed by the General Assembly in 2002 (resolution 57/265) on the initiative of Tunisia as a mechanism to address the issues of poverty and privation in the world and to reduce disparities among peoples.  In order to keep abreast of the profound changes on the international scene and the new realities they have produced in international relations  along with the various challenges and complexities those changes represent  we must act to strengthen the capacity of the United Nations to act more efficiently. We must also endeavour to reform the Organization  develop its structures and enhance the role it is expected to play to ameliorate the current international situation and turn globalization into a process that helps to guarantee peace and development for all peoples.  In that context  Tunisia supports all efforts and initiatives aimed at establishing new frameworks and mechanisms for action that can help to find collective solutions to common challenges in the vital fields of security  peace  development  the environment and food security  as part of an appropriate approach to international relations founded on the complementarity between peace  security and development. However  that should be accompanied by strengthened multilateral action on the basis of cooperation  solidarity and a constructive dialogue among all countries.  Despite efforts to contain it  the heightened problem of terrorism in the world strengthens our belief in the need to unify the international approach to fighting that scourge and finding adequate solutions to it. Since the early 1990s  Tunisia has warned the international community against the dangers of terrorism and has called for the adoption of a comprehensive and efficient approach that takes into consideration the root causes of the scourge. Today  we renew the call of His Excellency President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali to convene an international conference under the auspices of the United Nations to develop an international code of conduct for the fight against terrorism to which all parties shall commit themselves.  Climate change and the resulting intensification of the problems of desertification  drought and the lack of drinking water pose a threat to all humankind today and are a source of great concern to all. While affirming the close link between the environment and development and the crucial importance of promoting cooperation and solidarity to respond to the challenges in that regard  we should like to emphasize the need to include concerns about the potential effects of climate change  particularly in the African and Mediterranean regions  among the international community’s priorities  as called for in the Tunis Declaration adopted by the International Solidarity Conference on Climate Change Strategies for the African and Mediterranean Regions  which was held in Tunisia in November 2007.  We would also like to reiterate the need to mobilize the necessary financial resources to promote research into climate monitoring and meteorology and the development of natural disaster early warning systems  in addition to the need to invest in reducing the greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming.  We are convinced that the success of development efforts and the strengthening of    08-53129 6  cooperation among our countries depend on providing a secure and stable international environment. Obstacles to success in that effort include the intensification of tensions and conflicts and the persistence of unresolved problems. In that regard  we reaffirm Tunisia’s commitment to the values of peace and to the principles of international legality as the path to achieving just and lasting solutions to pending international issues. We also renew our determination to promote the values of moderation  tolerance and mutual respect in relations among countries and peoples and to establish bridges of communication and dialogue among all civilizations  cultures and religions.  In that context  while reaffirming Tunisia’s position in support of our Palestinian brothers and their just cause as a people  we renew our call to the international community  especially its most influential members and the Quartet  to increase their efforts to bring Israel to end its aggressive practices and settlement activities. We call on them to intensify their work to reinvigorate the peace effort and to facilitate the resumption of negotiations between Palestinians and Israelis on the basis of the relevant international terms of reference  the Arab Peace Initiative and the results of the Annapolis Conference  with the aim of achieving a just  lasting and comprehensive solution to the Palestinian question.   Such a solution would guarantee that the Palestinians regain their legitimate national rights and establish an independent Palestinian State on their national territory. It would also guarantee the withdrawal of Israel from all occupied Arab territories  including Syrian and Lebanese land. That solution would also provide security and stability for all the peoples of the region.  We also call for joint regional and international efforts to address the deterioration of security and humanitarian conditions in Iraq and to help the brotherly Iraqi people to restore security and stability so that they may devote their energies to reconstruction efforts while preserving their national and territorial unity.  We wish to take this opportunity to express our satisfaction with the recent positive developments in our sisterly country of Lebanon  namely  the election of the country’s President and the establishment of a Government of national unity. We trust that our Lebanese brothers will further strengthen that process in order to preserve Lebanon’s security and stability.  Since the change of 7 November 1987  and under the wise leadership of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali  President of the Republic of Tunisia  we have succeeded in accomplishing remarkable achievements in every area  due to substantial reforms that have strengthened the democratic process  promoted mechanisms to protect human rights and culture and consecrated public freedoms. Those reforms have enabled us to expand the scope of consultation and participation by the various sectors of civil society in identifying major trends and determining crucial national options within the framework of the rule of law and respect for institutions.  Those reforms have also made it possible to achieve many of the Millennium Development Goals  which has led to the improvement of living standards and the well-being of all segments of Tunisian society. Those achievements reflect the sound development choices and approaches implemented in Tunisia  which have allowed us to reach a high position on the list of countries with the highest human development indicators. That has earned Tunisia the respect of international financial institutions and the specialized agencies of the United Nations.  In its various development plans  Tunisia has continued to work for development and modernization in order to strengthen its capacity to keep up with international changes and actively contribute to building a world of peace and security and to make international relations more balanced and based on solidarity.  Based on its desire to achieve a higher level of integration at the regional and international levels  Tunisia is working to expand its participation in regional and international organizations and to develop political relations with friendly countries. It also endeavouring to expand and diversify its scope of cooperation with them so as to establish an effective partnership based on mutual respect and common interests. In that regard  Tunisia firmly believes that the Arab Maghreb Union is a strategic and crucial choice for all peoples of the region. In cooperation and coordination with the other friendly Maghreb countries  we are sparing no effort to speed up the establishment of the Union.    7 08-53129   Tunisia is also eager to promote joint Arab action and to enhance its ability to interact with regional and international bodies in order to address the changes taking place in the region and to contribute to the promotion of the reform and modernization process in the Arab world  in conformity with the decisions of the 2004 Arab summit held in Tunis.  With regard to Africa  Tunisia is contributing to the achievement of peace and security in the continent by participating in United Nations peacekeeping operations and by developing economic relations with friendly African countries. Based on our belief in the importance of joint African action and the fact that the African Union is the ideal framework to address the continent’s problems and achieve the integration to which our peoples aspire  Tunisia reaffirms its strong determination to pursue the process decided within the framework of the African Union to establish and operationalize its institutions  enhance its role in the resolution of conflicts and promote the development process in Africa.  With regard to Europe  Tunisia attaches strategic importance to its relations with the European Union (EU) and is continuing to work to develop those relations on the basis of a solidarity-based partnership with EU countries on the basis of dialogue  cooperation and mutual respect. The building of a Euro-Mediterranean cooperation framework is one of Tunisia’s priorities and a tenet of its foreign policy. Tunisia has therefore supported every initiative and mechanism that contributes to the promotion of peace  solidarity and development in the Mediterranean region — including the Barcelona process  the 5+5 Dialogue  and the Mediterranean Forum.  Tunisia was among the first countries to welcome the French initiative on the establishment of the Union for the Mediterranean. We are convinced that the future of that initiative depends upon an effective partnership that guarantees the active participation of the countries of the southern Mediterranean in establishing the foundations of the Union and in the taking of decisions of concern to the region.  Meeting the challenges posed by the new international situation and the profound changes taking place on the world scene requires us all to step up efforts to further entrench the noble universal principles and humanist values on which the United Nations was founded. It also requires perseverance in enhancing the process of United Nations reform to make its work more efficient and to ensure its active contribution to providing optimum international conditions that can help us find collective solutions to common challenges and current international issues  respond to our peoples’ aspirations for stability  and provide the appropriate conditions for prosperity and well-being in an environment of cooperation and solidarity-based development. "
"174",7013,"TUR",63,2008,"At the outset  I wish to extend our sincere congratulations to Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session. I would also like to take the opportunity to pay tribute to the President of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session  Mr. Srgjan Kerim  for his able leadership during his past term.  For Turkey  the United Nations Charter reflects the common aspirations and conscience of humanity. The United Nations provides a political and moral compass for our endeavours towards a just international order — a better order that will prevent new conflicts  ensure that human rights are upheld and lead to more equitable and sustainable distribution of prosperity.  In this framework  we believe that the most pressing task before the international community is to bridge  as quickly as possible  the enormous gap between the wealthiest and the least fortunate. We have certainly made considerable progress in that direction  including towards meeting the Millennium Development Goals; however  our common fight against poverty  illiteracy  epidemic diseases  child mortality and climate change is still far from over. On the contrary  volatile fuel prices  the food crisis and the global economic slowdown have brought about an even   21 08-51570  more challenging development and security environment. Under such circumstances  the fight against terrorism  racism  xenophobia and all forms of religious discrimination and extremism takes on particular importance.  We must indeed remain extremely vigilant against the risk of further alienation between different cultures and religions. In that respect  we regard the Alliance of Civilizations initiative  which we cosponsored with Spain under the auspices of the United Nations Secretary-General  as an important instrument that can help us avoid such a dangerous track.  Turkey will continue to be a leading country in further advancing the goals of this initiative which enjoys worldwide backing  including from the European Union and the Organization of the Islamic Conference. We hope that the Group of Friends of the Alliance of Civilizations  which now consists of 14 international organizations and 76 countries representing different regions ranging from Latin America to Africa and Asia  will keep growing. In this vein  we look forward to hosting the second Forum meeting of the Alliance of Civilizations in Istanbul next April.  As I said  a top priority issue on our agenda is the need to address the problems of the developing world. There is no question that developing countries should get all the assistance they need to achieve sustainable development. They must be supported under a renewed global development agenda and through increased foreign investments and enhanced trade facilities. For its part  Turkey is trying to contribute to this endeavour  first and foremost through increased development assistance. Turkey also provides special facilities for development  health  education and agricultural projects in various parts of the world. As a result of such fast-growing aid programmes  Turkey is now recognized as an emerging donor country by the international community.  The United Nations Ministerial Conference of the Least Developed Countries which Turkey hosted in Istanbul last year has clearly demonstrated our commitment to humanitarian and development assistance. We have now offered to host the Fourth Ministerial Conference. Similarly  the first-ever Turkey-Africa Cooperation Summit held in Istanbul last month provided an important opportunity to explore new avenues of cooperation with the African continent.  Turkey is also committed to combating global warming  which has serious implications for the entire world  but more so for the developing countries. Driven by that conviction  we are taking active part in negotiations to shape our new global climate change agreement  which will replace the Kyoto Protocol.  Turkey also pays special attention to the global water crisis. In that regard  we hope that the Fifth World Water Forum which we will host in Istanbul next March will inspire new thinking and concrete action on this important question.  If I may now turn to the political issues besetting our region  I am pleased to note that Turkey has been actively contributing to the advancement of peace by facilitating dialogue. We have also been working hard to build a sense of co-ownership of regional issues among our neighbours through a series of regional cooperation initiatives. Encouraged by its strong regional ties  Turkey has launched another initiative designed to prevent further conflict in the recently traumatized South Caucasus. In that regard  I believe that the Caucasus Stability and Cooperation Platform proposed by Turkey could be an instrumental framework for building a climate of confidence in the region that will allow discussion of our common problems in a democratic setting.  In the light of impressions from my visits to our neighbours Armenia and Azerbaijan and those of Prime Minister Erdogan to the Russian Federation and Georgia  all parties concerned seem receptive to the idea; we hope they will give it a chance to work. I sincerely believe that a positive perspective thus created will help to solve frozen conflicts  including occupied Nagorno-Karabakh  on the basis of respect for the principle of territorial integrity. No doubt  such a perspective will also help improve the bilateral ties between the countries of the region.   The President returned to the Chair.  It is also well past time to settle the conflicts of the Middle East  at the core of which lies the Palestinian question. Turkey actively supports all endeavours to bring about a lasting solution to that central problem and alleviate the plight of the Palestinian people. Turkey is also making every effort to help advance the Syrian and Lebanese tracks. One    08-51570 22  recent example is the indirect peace talks that Syria and Israel started under Turkey’s auspices this past May in Istanbul.   In Iraq  too  Turkey stands firmly with the Iraqi people and Government. Besides our bilateral efforts  I am particularly pleased to see that the Neighbouring Countries process  which I initiated five years ago  is functioning well. If the international community’s efforts are to succeed  the Iraqi people need to settle their differences through dialogue and compromise on controversial issues  among them the final status of Kirkuk.   Afghanistan is another country where Turkey is investing heavily in the future of a nation with which we have special historical ties. Turkey will continue to contribute to the security of the Afghan people and to their reconstruction efforts. We will also continue our initiatives to create an atmosphere conducive to regional ownership and cooperation  in particular between Pakistan and Afghanistan. That is equally vital for the common struggle against terrorism and for the stability of the region.   Finally  an urgent and peaceful settlement of the question of Iran’s nuclear programme  in conformity with International Atomic Energy Agency norms and Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons obligations and respecting the right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy  remains high on Turkey’s active diplomatic agenda.   I am convinced that would-be solutions to individual conflicts in the Middle East will be sustainable only if we adopt a comprehensive approach based on a positive vision for the future. That is why I invite all the parties to give serious consideration to the longstanding idea of collective arrangements for conflict prevention and resolution that would promote regional security and stability by building confidence  facilitating political dialogue and encouraging economic and cultural cooperation in the Middle East.   Turkey gives full backing to diplomatic efforts towards a political settlement in Cyprus. The solution lies in the establishment of a new partnership State composed of two constituent States of equal status. The process towards that goal should be based on the United Nations parameters of bi-zonality and the political equality of the two sides. We welcome and firmly support the comprehensive settlement negotiations recently started between the two leaders under the good offices of the Secretary-General.   At the same time  I believe that efforts to end the unfair isolation of the Turkish Cypriots who voted courageously in favour of the Comprehensive Settlement of the Cyprus Problem in 2004 — a plan that was unfortunately rejected by the other side — are long overdue.   Before concluding  I would like to stress the indispensable nature of the United Nations in resolving all those matters. Indeed  without an effective and functional world body  it is impossible to realize the hopes and expectations of our nations. That is why we attach the utmost importance to reforming and further strengthening the United Nations system as a whole. It is also why Turkey is constantly stepping up its engagement in and contributions to all aspects of the United Nations agenda  ranging from development and peacekeeping to human rights.   It is also with that sense of responsibility that Turkey has decided to put forth its candidature for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council for 2009 and 2010. Turkey has not been represented in the Council for nearly half a century  and we believe that the main tenets of our foreign policy  together with our economic  social and cultural attributes  will allow us to bring added value to the work of the Council. I hope that the General Assembly  with its valuable support  will do us the honour of granting Turkey the opportunity to do so.  "
"175",7029,"TUV",63,2008,"Standing before the Assembly for the first time  I am greatly honoured by this opportunity to speak on behalf of the people and Government of Tuvalu.  Next week  on 1 October  Tuvalu will commemorate the thirtieth anniversary of its independence. While we take pride in moving forward in nationhood  as a small and young nation  we have full confidence in the noble goals of the United Nations to guide us through the waters of our destiny. Our presence here in the United Nations is our statement of hope and trust in the goodwill of humanity.  Let me on this occasion express Tuvalu’s deep appreciation to all members of the international community for their invaluable support to my nation  and convey its warmest greetings and felicitations to the Assembly at its sixty-third session.  I wish also to associate us with previous speakers in extending our congratulations to the President on his election and in expressing our appreciation to his predecessor  particularly for promoting the issue of climate change  among other matters  within the Assembly’s agenda.  Climate change is without doubt the most serious threat to the global security and survival of mankind. It is an issue of enormous concern to a highly vulnerable small island State like Tuvalu. Here in this great house we now know both the science and economics of climate change. We also know the cause of climate change  and that human actions by all countries are urgently needed to address it.  The central message to us  world leaders  of both the International Panel on Climate Change reports and the Sir Nicholas Stern report on climate change is crystal clear: unless urgent actions are taken to curb greenhouse gas emissions by shifting to a new global energy mix based on renewable energy sources  and unless there is timely adaptation  the adverse impacts of climate change on all communities will be catastrophic.  This great family  the United Nations  must not fail to take heed of these timely warnings  and to save us all  particularly the small and most vulnerable  from this man-made catastrophe.  The next 12 to 18 months are crucial in the context of negotiating a new international agreement on climate change  based on the Bali Action Plan. We must work together to ensure that all countries make a substantial effort to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.  We need to find the right incentives to ensure that all countries contribute to dramatically reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This requires a substantial collective effort. It also requires strong political leadership. Tuvalu observes with great disappointment the clear absence of this leadership particularly emerging from the recently concluded Group of Eight (G-8) Summit. We need stringent  short-term targets by all major developed countries.  Based on the principle of the polluter pays and common but differentiated responsibilities  the industrialized world must show strong leadership in advancing real actions on climate change. But all countries must also act. In the little way we can  we in the small island developing States are also committed to contributing to emission reduction through use of renewable energy.  While we call for urgent action to reduce emissions  we know that the impacts of climate change are upon us. For a highly vulnerable small coral atoll nation like Tuvalu  the consequences of the impacts of climate change are frightening. The survival and security of our entire nation  along with fundamental human rights and its cultural identity  are under threat; Tuvalu is right on the edge of existence. Climate change could well push us over that edge.  Last year Tuvalu produced an international blueprint on adaptation which we presented as a submission to the Conference of the parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. This blueprint highlights a number of areas where we envisage greater collaboration within the United Nations system. Let me highlight a few.  First  it is very clear that financial resources for adaptation are completely inadequate. Last year Oxfam International suggested that the adaptation needs of developing countries will cost a minimum of $50 billion per year. We must work together to find these additional funds. One means of increasing the   15 08-52265  funding for adaptation is through the creation of what we call a burden-sharing mechanism. Funding for this mechanism could come from levies on the share of the proceeds from emissions trading and international aviation and maritime transport.  We also believe that new and additional sources of funding must be identified and channelled through the recently established Adaptation Fund to help fund concrete adaptation projects in-country to adapt to the impacts of climate change  while ensuring long-term survival and livelihoods of our God-given lands. While we welcome  therefore  the recent launch of several new funding initiatives on climate change  we must caution against the fragmentation of international efforts  and warn of the need  not to do more studies  but to fulfil obligations to urgently save those suffering from climate change.  Secondly  we need collaborative action by United Nations institutions and non-governmental organizations to develop a comprehensive approach to long-term adaptation action. As a first step  we believe  a special coordination committee should be established under the auspices of the General Assembly.  Thirdly  the blueprint proposes the establishment of an international climate insurance pool. This would be an internationally sourced pool of funds for an insurance mechanism to provide support to the most vulnerable communities to meet the costs of rebuilding after climate-related disasters.  Those are only three ideas we have elaborated in our blueprint. There are a number of others. We encourage the President to look closely at the blueprint and develop the ideas further.  We strongly believe that it is the political and moral responsibility of the world  particularly those who caused the problem  to save small islands and countries like Tuvalu from climate change and ensure that we continue to live in our home islands with long-term security  cultural identity and fundamental human dignity. Forcing us to leave our islands due to the inaction of those responsible is immoral  and cannot be used as a quick-fix solution to the problem.  In the context of all this  therefore  Tuvalu also strongly supports the draft resolution on security and climate change submitted by the Pacific small island developing States  to be reintroduced at this sixty-third session. We urge others to co-sponsor this very important draft resolution and properly address the issues raised in it.  Tuvalu recently attended the High-Level Conference on World Food Security. We share the grave concerns regarding the current global issue of high food prices  food shortages and their associated social problems for humanity  which are made worse by high fuel prices. We highly commend the initiative taken by the Secretary-General in establishing the High-Level Task Force on the Global Food Security Crisis  and the formulation of a Comprehensive Framework for Action. We sincerely hope that this Framework will produce concrete results in countries experiencing the food crisis.   One of the most sensitive issues for small and vulnerable island developing States like Tuvalu has been the lack of recognition of our unique vulnerability in the consideration of the question of graduation from the least developed country (LDC) status. Our economic and environmental vulnerabilities cannot be ignored. The enormous threat of more severe weather events and a rising sea level hangs overhead like a large storm cloud. It hinders investment in our country and potentially puts into question our very survival. We therefore make a strong and heartfelt appeal to the General Assembly  the Economic and Social Council and our development partners to carefully reconsider the criteria for LDC graduation.   Two issues are of particular concern. First  it is remarkable that nearly all recent graduates and potential graduates are small islands — including my own country  Tuvalu. The small island States that are also LDCs eligible for graduation all have improved their per capita income and their human assets. Also  they have in common the fact that they are highly vulnerable in economic and environmental terms. But this vital criterion of vulnerability does not seem to be taken seriously enough. In short  our countries are or could be losing LDC status because of progress they have made on per capita income  despite the fact that the sustainability of that income is challenged by our vulnerability.   My second point has to do with the serious lack of coherence within the United Nations system. For several years the high level of vulnerability of small island developing States has been recognized and reiterated in many different United Nations circles — in Rio  Barbados  Mauritius and Johannesburg  as well    08-52265 16  as in several other major United Nations events  including the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) Summit Declaration. Yet this special vulnerability has never been given serious recognition in the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council  let alone recognized as the main criterion for LDC graduation.   I therefore call on the United Nations to work seriously towards reform of the graduation rule so that no LDC that is recognized as highly vulnerable is forced to lose its LDC status.   Tuvalu wishes to commend the ongoing reforms within the United Nations but would also note with grave concern that progress is slow. We clearly need to restructure and expand the Security Council in order to properly reflect regional balance. We must take a fresh look at the membership so that the Council can properly address emerging global peace and security challenges  including climate change. We also believe that a seat should be allocated for a representative from a small island developing State in the reformed Security Council.   In the broader context of United Nations reforms  I support the Secretary-General’s remarks that    “Our changing world needs a stronger United Nations. …    “we need to be faster. … We need to pay less attention to rhetoric  and more attention to results — to getting things done.” (A/62/PV.4  pp. 1-2)  I could not agree more. To this end  I appeal again to the United Nations for the earliest establishment of its Joint Presence office in Tuvalu in order to facilitate better coordination of United Nations interventions.   Tuvalu believes strongly that nations have the right to self-determination. The United Nations must uphold this principle. Therefore  we believe it is time that the United Nations properly addressed the issue of Taiwan’s meaningful participation in the United Nations specialized agencies. My Government strongly supports Taiwan’s aspirations to meaningfully participate in the United Nations and its specialized agencies  recognizing Taiwan’s own political and economic achievements and its constructive contribution to international development  trade  health  education and technology. We appeal strongly that Taiwan’s aspirations to participate as a full member of specialized agencies of the United Nations be given proper and urgent attention.   Finally  our story on the achievement of the MDGs is mixed. For small island developing States like Tuvalu  addressing our sustainable development challenges is not simply poverty reduction. It is the MDGs-plus. More than ever  we need a significant increase in direct financing  technology and capacity development  as recognized under the Mauritius Strategy for Implementation  to cope with our unique island challenges.   Mr. Derrick Sikua (Solomon Islands)  Vice-President  took the Chair.   My Government firmly believes that the next 12 months will be an extremely critical time in the history of the United Nations. We must act promptly and decisively to address climate change  to achieve the Millennium Development Goals and to respond to the global crises on food and energy. These issues are closely linked. We must rise to these challenges.  God bless the United Nations. Tuvalu mo te Atua."
"176",7075,"TZA",63,2008,"Allow me at the outset to convey my very warm regards and congratulations to you  Sir  on your well-deserved election to preside over the sixty-third session of this Assembly.  On behalf of the African Union  the United Republic of Tanzania and in my own name  I would like to assure you of our unqualified support and cooperation throughout your term of office. Allow me also to use this opportunity to thank and congratulate your predecessor  Ambassador Srgjan Kerim  President of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session  for his leadership and for a job very well done.  Our illustrious Secretary-General  His Excellency Ban Ki-moon  deserves special tribute from us for the excellent manner in which he is discharging the responsibilities of his high office. We appreciate the way in which he has answered the call of duty. My delegation and I reaffirm our support for his great work. His devotion to achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) reversing the impact of climate change and his concern for Africa’s development have won the hearts of many of us in the continent.  As I stand before this Assembly in my dual capacity as Chairman of the African Union and as President of my country  I bring with me a message of hope and optimism from Africa. Africa is no longer the hopeless case as perceived by some. There are so many good things happening in the continent. There is increasing political stability  peace reigns in almost all nations but a few and the economies of many nations are blossoming.  Africa is now a continent in full embrace of democracy  good governance  rule of law and respect for human rights. There is stronger commitment to deal with vices in society  including the problems of corruption.  Most African countries have embraced democratic governance and regular  periodic elections are the norm. In the past two years  a good number of African countries have successfully held democratic elections. It is a matter of principle enshrined in the Constitutive Act of the African Union that leaders who come into office through undemocratic means are not allowed to participate in the activities of the African Union. It is this principle that guided the African Union in suspending Mauritania from the organs of the African Union until democratic dispensations are restored.  It is heart-warming  indeed  that Africans  through the African Union and their regional economic organizations  have been proactive and have taken the lead in monitoring elections and resolving conflicts where they have arisen. This was the case with Kenya and very recently with Zimbabwe. Indeed  Africa has come of age. The old principle of non-interference in internal affairs is surely being replaced by non-indifference to violations of democracy and abuse of human rights in Member States.  There are fewer conflicts in the continent today than was the case a few years ago. This is testimony to the fact that democracy and good governance are taking root and the African peace and security architecture is working. However  much more needs to be done to strengthen the African Union’s capacity for early warning  conflict prevention and conflict resolution. There is also a need to do the same with the regional economic groupings to buttress their peacebuilding efforts.  I would like to recognize the United Nations  the European Union and States and other institutions in the world that have generously supported the strengthening of the infant African Union peace and security mechanism. I would like to call on all of them to    08-51570 32  continue supporting the African Union mechanism as well as the regional mechanisms and peacekeeping operations in Africa.  There are only three conflict situations worth mentioning and discussing in this Assembly today. These concern the conflicts in Darfur and Somalia and the volatile security situation in the eastern part of Democratic Republic of the Congo.  In Darfur  the humanitarian crisis still persists although there may be some encouraging signs of improvement. I believe the situation would be much better if the entire contingent of the United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID) forces was deployed  and the peace talks between the rebels and the Government of Sudan were resumed and concluded. Also  improvement would be seen if humanitarian aid work was allowed to be carried out unencumbered and matters related to justice were dealt with judiciously.  There is a need therefore for the United Nations  the African Union and the Government of the Sudan to continue to work together expeditiously to remove the obstacles impeding the deployment of UNAMID  to remove the obstacles impeding the dialogue between the Government of the Sudan and the rebels  impeding humanitarian operations and impeding the process of dispensation of justice in Darfur.  I was in Sudan two weeks ago and held very fruitful discussions with His Excellency President Omar Al-Bashir. I also met officials of the Joint UN-AU peacekeeping mission in Darfur. We discussed the situation in Darfur  the obstacles involved and came to some understanding on the way forward. I am hopeful that progress can be made. We need to seize the moment and the opportunities that are now unfolding.  It is the considered view of the African Union that the indictment of President Omar Al-Bashir at this particular point in time will complicate the deployment of UNAMID and the management of the humanitarian crisis in Darfur. It is for this reason that the African Union sees deferment as the most expedient measure now.  Let me make one thing clear: when we talk about deferment  we should not in any way be perceived as condoning injustice. Justice is a matter of essence. It must be done  it must be seen to be done. We are simply concerned with the best possible sequencing of measures so that the most immediate matters of saving lives and easing the suffering of the people of Darfur are taken care of first. Getting the support and cooperation of the Government of the Sudan is a matter of essence in the fulfilment of all that we want to seen done in Darfur.  The conflict in Somalia remains difficult to manage and resolve. The inter-party dialogue has not yet borne the desired results. The African Union peacekeeping efforts seem to be overstretched. We call upon the United Nations to step in and take over the peacekeeping responsibilities at the earliest possible time before the African Union mission is overwhelmed. Time is of the essence. Let me use this opportunity to commend the Governments of Ethiopia  Uganda and Burundi for their invaluable contribution to peacekeeping efforts in Somalia.  The volatile security situation in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo is a matter of great concern. We are deeply saddened by the ongoing fighting between the government forces and rebel forces of General Laurent Nkunda. The continued presence of negative forces threatening the security of countries neighbouring the Democratic Republic of the Congo is another complicating factor.  The African Union is committed to be more proactive in the search for lasting peace in that troubled region. We will work with regional leaders and the United Nations in that regard.  On September 15 this year  a landmark breakthrough was achieved in the Zimbabwe political crisis when the three political parties to the conflict: The African National Union-Patriotic Front  the Movement for Democratic Change-Tsvangirai and the Movement for Democratic Change-Mutambara  signed the historic agreement for ending the conflict and forming an inclusive Government. The leaders of those three parties are now engaged in the process of implementing that agreement. Getting to this point in a conflict situation that seemed almost impossible to resolve is a major achievement indeed.  We need to congratulate President Robert Mugabe  Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai and Deputy Prime Minister Arthur Mutambara on their wisdom and statesmanship. We also need to acknowledge  recognize and commend  in a special manner  President Thabo Mbeki of the Republic of   33 08-51570  South Africa for his sterling leadership. It was his patience  perseverance and understanding that made it all happen. His imminent departure from office  which comes suddenly  raises some concerns about what may happen if difficulties are experienced with the implementation of the agreement. I see no cause for alarm. The South African Government remains  and I am sure the new leadership will continue to be  seized of the matter.   Moreover  since the agreement is the product of the decision taken in July by the African Union at its summit in Sharm el-Sheikh  Egypt  the African Union and the Southern Africa Development Community stand ready to assist if need should arise.  We in Africa thank you  Mr. President  for including the food and oil crises among the themes for this session of the General Assembly. The current global escalation of food and fuel prices has reached crisis proportions. Sub-Saharan Africa is the region affected the most. It is home to the majority of the least developed countries on this planet. Their food and oil bills have increased exponentially. Food import bills have increased by over 40 per cent over the past year  while oil prices have increased by over 100 per cent since 2005. Even the recent drop in oil prices has not helped much  because prices are still more than twice what they were in 2005.  The high food and oil prices threaten to erode the humble gains made in implementing the Millennium Development Goals and sustaining macroeconomic stability in Africa. The food and oil crisis  coupled with the worsening financial crisis throughout the world  gives us every reason to be very worried. The need for comprehensive action to reverse the situation cannot be overemphasized. We call upon the international community and key players in the global economy to act quickly. The United Nations should take the lead.  Yesterday  this Assembly held a high-level event on Africa’s development needs. The meeting received a comprehensive report from the Secretary-General on “Africa’s development needs: state of implementation of various commitments  challenges and the way forward” (A/63//130). We are glad to note that the report incorporated some of the recommendations of the Millennium Development Goals Africa Steering Group.  The report’s findings underscore the fact that Africa cannot meet its development needs without the support of the international community. Indeed  the international community has been responding favourably. A number of commitments to assisting Africa have been made over the years in different international forums. Unfortunately  the commitments made have not been met fully.  We appeal to the General Assembly to echo the call and impress upon Africa’s development partners the need to honour their promise and deliver on their commitments. I also urge this family of United Nations Member States to fully support the political declaration adopted at the high-level meeting yesterday  as we re-dedicate ourselves to meeting the development needs of Africa.  We in Africa have been following with keen interest the ongoing process of the reform of the United Nations. We remain convinced of the ideal that a reform of the United Nations would be incomplete without a reform of the Security Council. On our part  we have authorized our permanent representatives in New York to embark on negotiations with all parties on the reforms of the Security Council. At this juncture  I should reiterate the position of the African Union of asking for two permanent seats with veto power and two non-permanent seats. Our demand should be seen against the backdrop of the reality that Africa is the only continent without a permanent seat in the Security Council  despite our large membership in the United Nations. That is an anomaly. It has to be corrected. The reform of the Security Council  therefore  should take that into account.  The reforms of the United Nations have  on the other hand  to enable the Organization to work better and be more efficient  effective and responsive to the challenges of our times. We are happy with the work of the General Assembly at its previous sessions on advancing the United Nations system-wide coherence agenda. The work has thus far advanced intergovernmental consultations on the United Nations delivering as one: one programme  one budget  one office and one leader.  Tanzania is one of the eight pilot countries on the United Nations “delivering as one” project. Our experience so far has shown that delivering as one is possible. It improves national ownership and strengthens national leadership in the development process. It permits the realignment of United Nations assistance with national priorities and streamlines    08-51570 34  business transactions  thus enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of United Nations activities. I urge this Assembly to follow up on the implementation of this important reform  and I appeal to our development partners to provide the requisite resources.  At the sixtieth session of this Assembly  I reported on the work of the Helsinki Process on Globalisation and Democracy  a joint initiative launched in 2003 and co-chaired by Finland and Tanzania. The Helsinki Process  a forum to facilitate multi-stakeholder dialogue on the possibilities offered and challenges posed by the process of globalization  has come to an end. The main objective of that initiative was to mobilize political will in support of the Millennium Development Goals. The President of Finland  Ms. Tarja Halonen  and I would be glad  as co-chairs of the Process  to present the final report to the Secretary-General this week. We trust that the report will add impetus to global efforts to see political will prevail in the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals. A democracy deficit in international institutions is attendant.  Before I conclude  allow me to mention three things. First  I would remind this world body that the Western Sahara problem remains unresolved. Allow me to make a humble appeal to the Security Council to expedite the process so that the matter is concluded soon. It has been going on for too long. The people of the Western Sahara will then be given the opportunity to determine which way to go. They deserve to be afforded the opportunity to live a normal life in a nation that has been designated as theirs.  Secondly  we should remain seized of the Palestinian question until the two-State solution — the State of Israel and a State of Palestine living together side by side and in harmony — is attained.   Thirdly  there is a matter that we discussed at the most recent African Union summit. It is with regard to the issue of universal jurisdiction being practiced by some European nations. It has now become a matter of harassment for African leaders. We discussed the matter at length at the summit  and we intend to raise this issue with the United Nations for appropriate attention.  Once again  I would like to reiterate the support of the African Union and Tanzania of your efforts  Sir  in fulfilling our collective objectives during this sixty-third session of the General Assembly. Count on our support; rely on our support. "
"177",7118,"UGA",63,2008,"Allow me at the outset  Sir  to congratulate you on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly. Uganda is convinced that  with your experience and well-known diplomatic skills  we shall have a successful session. I wish today to pay tribute to your predecessor  His Excellency Srgjan Kerim  for the excellent manner in which he presided over the sixty-second session. I would also like to pay tribute to the Secretary-General for his leadership and efforts to reform our Organization.  The founding fathers of the United Nations had a dream of creating an organization whose purpose  among others  was “to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic  social  cultural or humanitarian character”. Today the world is facing a multitude of problems  many of which the United Nations was meant to address.   It is encouraging that the theme chosen for this session is the impact of the global food crisis on poverty and hunger in the world as well as the need to democratize the United Nations. The view of some of us in Uganda is that the so-called food crisis is actually good for equatorial Africa. It is certainly good for Uganda’s farmers. Over the years  we have been growing a lot of food: maize  bananas  Irish potatoes  sweet potatoes  cassava  rice and wheat; and producing animal products such as milk and beef. The problem has always been the market for this food.   That was an account of two problems: first  protectionism in the United States  the European Union  Japan  China  et cetera; and secondly  the lack of factories to process that food so that it could reach distant markets. Apart from these two  there are other factors in some African countries  including poor traffic infrastructure  lack of electricity  lack of seeds  et cetera. These  however  do not apply to Uganda. In the case of Uganda  the problem has been the lack of markets and low processing capacity  in other words  low value addition. The rest we have  or we can have easily.   The high food and commodity prices have arisen on account of the hundreds of millions of Chinese and Indians that have entered the opulent middle class in the last 20 years. That means they need better food  better houses that require cement and steel bars  and better means of locomotion such as cars. That is why food and commodity prices have gone up. It is for the same reason that petroleum prices have gone up: if only 200 people were driving cars previously  the number has now risen to 400. That means more demand for petroleum. Following the continuously   21 08-51606  rising petroleum prices  some Western countries have started talking of biofuels — using plants to produce diesel.   Uganda  however  welcomes all of this. It is an opportunity  as far as we are concerned. It is not a bottleneck. In fact  farmers in Uganda are already reaping high. That is why our economy grew by 9 per cent last year. Once we solve the problem of energy  our economy will grow in double digits.   It is good that the United States of America  the European Union  India  Japan and China have opened their markets to African products  tariff-free  quota-free. However  there is still the issue of subsidies. They should be removed. In Uganda  we farm without subsidies. Why should not the farmers in those countries with better infrastructure  lower interest rates  abundant electricity  et cetera  do the same? Why do they need protection? Protectionism interferes with those countries that can produce food easily  such as Uganda. That is not correct.   We have been producing too much milk without having the capacity to process it. Recently  an Indian-owned company installed a high-tech integrated milk-processing plant and began to process powdered milk  producing a whole range of finished milk products: pasteurized milk  ultra-heat-treated (long-life) milk  yoghurt  butter  ghee  et cetera. Those milk products are now being exported to all parts of the world.  Another example has been bananas. Uganda produces 10 million metric tons of bananas per annum. These are high-quality bananas — called enyam wonyo in one of our local dialects — which contain rare ingredients. They are quite different from the bananas known in other parts of the world. Forty per cent of those bananas have been rotting in gardens and marketplaces. Our scientists  funded by our Government  are now converting them into processed foods such as flour  bread  snacks  et cetera.   High fuel prices are a real problem for countries that do not have petroleum. Maximizing the use of other forms of energy — including hydropower; geothermal power  which is used effectively in countries such as Iceland; solar power; wind power; and biofuels — is part of the answer for such countries. All that  however  depends on the development of human resources through education. An educated population has more capacity to look for answers than an uneducated population.   As far as Uganda is concerned  in addition to lazy individuals  the only groups that are adversely affected by high food prices are salary earners in towns. Unlike farmers  they cannot benefit from higher food prices; yet they must buy food. Fortunately  however  all such families in Uganda have a dual capacity: in addition to being salary earners  they or their relatives own land in rural areas. They can therefore subsidize themselves by growing food using that land. Africa and other regions with agriculture-based economies should rise up  utilize their full potential and take advantage of high food prices.  Regarding the statement that I have heard repeated so many times since the opening of the present session of the General Assembly — that no African country can achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015 — I would like to make two positions clear. First  the statement confirms what I said yesterday at the high-level meeting on Africa’s development needs. Discussing sustainable development without discussing socio-economic transformation is not correct. We have repeatedly pointed that out. I have often used the example of pregnancy: one cannot talk endlessly about “sustainable pregnancy”. Yes  pregnancy should be sustainable until it transitions into a baby. Therefore  as Europe did  and as other societies in Asia have recently done  Africa must metamorphose socially  economically and technologically from a pre-industrial  sometimes feudal  society into a middle-class and skilled-working-class society  period. Achievement of all the MDGs would be the consequence of such a metamorphosis.  One cannot maintain a pre-industrial society and somehow achieve the MDGs. An industrial society is what Uganda has been working towards over the past 20 years. Africa must industrialize  develop a modern services sector and commercialize agriculture. That means that emphasis must be placed on market access. It means that we should not only gain access to the major markets of the world  but also rationalize our own African markets through regional and continental integration. It also means that  in order to lower the costs of doing business in Africa  we should deal with energy; transport  especially by rail; and primary and higher-level education. Achievement of the MDGs would be a consequence of these developments  rather than a precursor or a phenomenon extraneous to them.    08-51606 22   Mr. Yáñez-Barnuevo (Spain)  Vice-President  took the Chair.  The second position that I would like to point out regarding the MDGs is that Uganda is on course to meet all of them except those related to maternal health and child mortality. I see no reason why those Goals should not be achieved. With the exception of combating HIV/AIDS — which is behaviour-related — I am sure that all the others are achievable if we in Uganda do enough political-led sensitization and investment.  I do not associate myself with those who are pessimistic about Africa or with those who put the cart before the horse. Why  for instance  were industrialization and value addition not made one of the MDGs? The export of raw materials is one of the cardinal sins that cause Africa to contribute only a 2 per cent share of world trade. If value were added to those raw materials  Africa’s share of world trade would rise  even today. Africa is exporting many things  but they are in the form of raw materials; that is why their value is 2 per cent. If value were added to those raw materials  their value would rise.  Moreover  that would create jobs for Africans and therefore contribute structurally to poverty eradication. How are we supposed to eradicate poverty without creating jobs  other than by using witchcraft? We have repeatedly pointed out these issues in several forums  to no avail. It is Africans themselves who can and should resolve them. "
"178",7165,"UKR",63,2008,"It is a great honour for me to address the world community: the United Nations and its biggest representative body  the General Assembly.  Together with all other Member States  I am grateful to the Macedonian representative Mr. Srgjan Kerim for his effective work as President of the Assembly at its last session.  I congratulate Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann of Nicaragua on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session. I wish him every success at this critical time.  I am confident that we all have the same feeling. Empty words and general discussions have had their day. We feel a cool wind in international relations that complicates and tempers mutual responsibilities. The difference in temperature and pressure leads to a hurricane. Atmospheric changes in worldwide politics have comparable effects.   5 08-51749   The great illusion of power becomes today’s ultimate weakness and the giant vehicle of ideals and shaping forces. The principal challenge before us lies in the neglect and undermining of the standards of international law and foreign affairs.  We see a trend towards the demolition of the global system  whose cornerstone is the unflagging international will and respect for the sovereignty  territorial integrity and established boundaries of States.  Ukraine has the right to speak these words. We were among the founders of the United Nations and one of the co-authors of its Charter.  We are a nation that underwent fatal trials and regained a commonwealth in a legitimate and recognized way. The representatives of dozens of States that share such a fate with us are here in this room.   The latest events in the Caucasus are of the utmost concern to us. I express condolences for the tragedy suffered by each human being and each family regardless of race or allegiance  — Georgians  Ossetians and Russians. Suffering does not discriminate among peoples. Each person has dignity and the ability to recognize truth  hypocrisy  deliberate aggression  manipulation of public opinion and candid support for separatism.   Ukraine condemns all acts of aggression and use of force that occurred in the region. Ukraine vigorously denounces violation of the territorial integrity and inviolability of the Georgian frontiers and the armed annexation of its territory.   Ukraine does not recognize the independence of the self-proclaimed republics of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Ukraine does not acknowledge  and condemns  the attempt at illegitimate and separatist affirmation of the statehood of any territories. This position is fundamental for Ukrainian foreign policy.  Deviation from the United Nations principles  such as the use of force  and the renewal of cold-war rhetoric provoke our deep concern. Those processes create a potential threat both for Ukraine and for other countries in the region.  The problem cannot be solved through isolation  self-isolation or mutual accusations. There is only one way out. With common and good will we are to consolidate our values and the aims contained in the United Nations Charter and the Millennium Declaration.  With full responsibility for peace and security  we need to stop disturbances by separatist spirits  which can turn into misfortune for the instigators themselves. It is essential to reject blackmailing and threatening vocabulary. Ukraine rejects pressure of any kind regarding ways to ensure its own security and to determine membership in collective security structures. Such attempts at infringement are short-sighted and counterproductive.  We call for the strengthening of the role of the Security Council  the only body with exclusive authority in issues of global peace and security. We need its decisions to be balanced and its actions to be effective.  Ukraine supports all efforts aimed at peaceful settlement and unblocking of the situation on the South Caucasus and will fully cooperate in that process. We will continue our peacekeeping activities firmly and vigorously  and we will participate in the settlement of the protracted conflicts on the basis of respect for the principles of sovereignty  territorial integrity  inviolability of borders  human rights  freedoms and dignity.  The world is waiting for a confident and positive response from the United Nations. The world needs renewed confidence in our collective efforts and strict adherence to the norms of international law and to the United Nations Organization.  Our national agenda is concordant with the main challenges facing the international community. As a country possessing the best black-earth soil in the world  Ukraine is going to contribute tangibly to the common work on solving the global food crisis.  We plan to consolidate all possible efforts to realize an effective and just energy policy. The principles that should be implemented are mutual benefit  the continuous fulfilment of obligations and the inadmissibility of any energy pressure.  We reinforce our call for more active global cooperation in the sphere of the environment. Ukraine puts forward an initiative to develop a binding framework agreement — a World Environmental Constitution — and to establish a single-structure system for ecological and environmental protection     08-51749 6  with relevant authority and mechanisms in the United Nations.  We plan to revitalize efforts in the fight against HIV/AIDS and other dangerous diseases. This problem remains highly topical for Ukraine.  Undoubtedly  Ukraine will continue to keep an eye on the whole range of common tasks and challenges  from poverty problems to trafficking in human beings  international terrorism and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.  The line we follow is clear. Our policy is based on democratic values  open dialogue with all partners of different cultures  and unconditional respect for fundamental human rights. I have the honour to appeal to the world community with a request for solidarity.  This year Ukraine will mark the seventy-fifth anniversary of the Great Famine — the Holodomor  which took the lives of about 10 million of our compatriots. Our intention is not directed against any people or State. We neither overstate nor understate our sorrow. The tenor of hunger in Ukraine was oriented towards genocide and was accompanied by the total elimination of the national elite  the public leadership and the priesthood. The goal was to overpower a nation of millions  because  according to the regime  there were too many people to displace to Siberia.  It is important that our steps encourage other countries of the former Soviet Union to find the truth. We share the pain of all the people affected — Russians  Belarusians  Kazakhs and dozens of other nations. We invite a joint commemoration of each national tragedy and no toleration of new attempts to create a heroic aureole around Stalin and his regime. We have invaluable examples of mutual understanding with Poland  Hungary and other States. Honest and sincere memories about the past have not split us but have united us. It is our aspiration that memories of the victims of the Holodomor and other crimes of totalitarian regimes will prevent the world from repeating such catastrophes.  I believe in our ability to respond effectively to every challenge the world is facing. Ukraine is determined to work on this. We will act as dedicated partners. Everything is in our hands. I believe in our power  will and wisdom. "
"179",7212,"URY",63,2008,"Uruguay  one of the founding States of the United Nations  sees the fundamental principles of its foreign policy fully reflected in the Charter of this Organization.   For that reason  we believe it important at the outset to reassert the validity of those principles in the present international context and to emphasize once again the traditional Uruguayan position of full respect for international law  support for multilateralism  peaceful settlement of disputes  sovereign equality of States  rejection of the use or threat of use of force  non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States  the self-determination of peoples  the promotion and protection of human rights and international economic and social cooperation.  It is worth repeating that this list is not simply an inventory of good intentions  but of legal principles and fundamental values. Their enshrinement in the Charter of the United Nations gives them the status of international law  to whose validity and enforcement all States must conform.  Furthermore  those principles are crucial guiding tools in a world that presents us today with major challenges. We  nations gathered here  have the moral and legal duty to find suitable solutions that will make peace and development the rule of coexistence for our peoples.  As we all know  a severe food crisis is currently afflicting too many countries throughout the world. If a sustainable and lasting solution in to be found  we must address the structural factors influencing and causing the crisis. Correcting the distortions in the multilateral trade system  in particular in agricultural trade  is certainly a decisive element in ensuring a plentiful supply of food that will meet the needs of the entire population of the planet.  Uruguay believes that  in addition to tackling this serious crisis with urgent measures  we must make progress towards a long-term solution. That inevitably means redoubling our efforts to strengthen the multilateral trade system and swiftly resuming the negotiations in the World Trade Organization. It is essential that we do so  particularly in the area of agriculture  in order to guarantee world food security and to avoid a reversion to protectionist practices that would only further aggravate the situation.   The food crisis is not the only crisis affecting us  however; another major challenge facing the world economy is undoubtedly that of energy. Here  as with agriculture  Latin America requires the technological cooperation of developed countries. Likewise  when it comes to developing the production of alternative energy sources  such as bioenergy and biofuels  research and technical assistance are essential if we are to benefit from the opportunities provided by such production without affecting food security or the environment. The United Nations has a crucially important catalytic role in that regard.   In addition  we cannot overlook the current financial crisis of the major developed countries  which demonstrates the global interconnectedness and interdependence among States. Although developing countries are certainly not the cause of the crisis  its effects afflict and punish the economies of emerging countries.    08-53129 30   With regard to the environment and sustainable development  Uruguay is a party to the major international conventions in that area. While we have emphasized the importance of international cooperation  we have also always emphasized the individual responsibility of every State to actively protect the environment in its own territory and waters  and have always valued the vigilant participation of civil society in that regard.   That is why  while we receive significant investments that contribute to our industrial development  my country also exerts rigorous control over the environmental practices of the entities involved  applying internationally recognized standards and requiring the use of the most modern technologies available  with effective control over the environmental impact of those undertakings. The Uruguayan Government thus reaffirms its unwavering commitment to protecting the environment as a human right and as a fundamental component in the achievement of true sustainable development.  Another major issue on the agenda of the General Assembly is the Millennium Development Goals agreed by Member States in September 2000  which Uruguay has fully endorsed. In that context  Uruguay has taken firm steps to achieve the Goals. We need only highlight  among other policies with a significant social content  the recent launching of our comprehensive national health system — aimed at transforming the health-care model by prioritizing primary health care and prevention in order to guarantee a basic right of all citizens — as part of the social inclusion policy that Uruguay is implementing.   Given its strict adherence to international law  Uruguay is also firmly committed to consolidating international peace and security  as demonstrated by its status as one of the 10 major contributors of troops to United Nations peacekeeping operations and as the world’s largest contributor per capita in terms of troop numbers. Our country is currently participating in 16 United Nations peacekeeping missions deployed in Africa  the Americas  Asia and Europe. Since we began to participate in peacekeeping missions  Uruguay has gained experience in matters related to reconstruction and peacebuilding in areas devastated by conflict  making great efforts to put an end to hostilities so that various societies and communities can agree on peace and achieve national reconciliation.  However  as our international experience has taught us  peacekeeping  while essential  is not sufficient to return affected countries to institutional normalcy and an orderly and peaceful life. That is why the strong involvement of the international community is needed in peacekeeping efforts to effectively ensure the building of stable  democratic and prosperous societies through robust institutional mechanisms for resolving their conflicts. For that reason  Uruguay submitted its candidature to the Peacebuilding Commission in February 2007. We hope to be able to contribute to the attainment of those noble objectives in that forum.    The cause of peace requires  in institutional terms  a strengthened and effective Organization. That brings us to the topic of the United Nations reform process. The negotiations in that regard have not proceeded with the scope and speed originally envisaged. Although the two recently established bodies  the Human Rights Council and the Peacebuilding Commission  have been in existence for a few years  we have not yet been able to move on to Security Council reform — which is essential — and only a few timid steps have been taken in the process of reforming the Secretariat and the General Assembly.   Uruguay reaffirms its support for the process of Security Council reform in the permanent and non-permanent membership categories. However  we will not support the creation of new members with the right of the veto  since we believe that the issue of extending the veto must not be included in the package to be agreed upon in the intergovernmental negotiations. Moreover  in keeping with its traditional position since the founding of the United Nations  our country disapproves of the right of veto  which is a privilege that runs counter to the full democratization of our Organization.   In the area of reform  we also view the One United Nations pilot project in two ways. We see it first as an instrument through which reform of the operational activities of the United Nations system could be put into practice; and secondly  as a cooperative exercise in areas of priority identified by the Uruguayan Government in the context of a national development strategy based on sustained and sustainable economic growth with equity and social justice. However  we understand that the programme should adapt itself to specific national priorities and needs. That is why no single model is applicable to all   31 08-53129  pilot countries  given their inherent differences from one another.  I also wish to refer to a topic of particular relevance for Uruguay — the situation of so-called middle-income countries. Those countries find themselves in a paradoxical situation. Although there are certain indicators of economic growth  negative circumstances that hinder sustainable and sustained growth in the medium- and long-terms have not been taken into account  nor has it been possible to prevent dramatic erosion of some of the progress made. In particular and with dramatic effect  the well-known clear vulnerability of the economies of developing countries in a globalized world economy subjects them to the effects of external crises with clear  direct consequences  such as rising poverty and inequity in income distribution  as well as strengthened migratory trends  to mention just some effects that Uruguay has experienced directly.   Finally  in affirming its unwavering commitment to the fight against terrorism  Uruguay reiterates its rejection of all terrorist acts and vigorously condemns all attacks against civil populations and public infrastructure  the destruction of which adversely affects the civil population. Terrorism must be unequivocally condemned and cooperation between States must increase in order to ensure that such acts do not go unpunished.  We must be careful  however. The fight against terrorism must always be waged based on the rule of law  and consequently in the strictest respect for the standards of international humanitarian and human rights law.  The same applies to drug trafficking. Our country has continued its unrelenting fight against illegal drug trafficking. Our effort targets both supply and demand. Thanks to that policy and beyond our success in stamping out the illicit traffic in those substances  our country has been at the vanguard of our continent in terms of its policies to prevent consumption and treat those affected by drugs.  Both terrorism and drug trafficking severely compromise the full enjoyment of human rights  the safeguarding of which has been one of the strategic policies of the current Government. We want respect for human rights to be more than routine rhetoric; it should enjoy full expression in the daily life of its citizens. On that basis  our country has prioritized strengthening legislation and the competent national bodies  and has sought to extend international human rights and to consolidate institutions that effectively protect and secure the international enjoyment of human rights and prevent their violation. In short  the protection of human rights is one of the central axes of the Republic’s foreign policy and is without a doubt Uruguay’s basic political institutional asset.  As is evident  the effective protection of human rights calls for a strong jurisdictional body to guarantee its application. In that context  the creation of the International Criminal Court (ICC) was a fundamental contribution to the progressive development of international law and an event of tremendous legal and political importance. In 2006  Uruguay enacted a national law pledging full cooperation with the ICC. Respectfully  we urge the international community as a whole to do the same in order to prevent genocide  war crimes and crimes against humanity from going unpunished.  In conclusion  I would like to stress that  with conflicts threatening peace and international security and taking into account the growing interdependence of States as a result of globalization  it is now crucial to emphatically reaffirm the relevance of the United Nations as the lead body and ultimate multilateral forum for finding appropriate solutions to today’s major global challenges.  The pursuit of multilateralism therefore implies a search for collective responses to international conflicts and problems  in accordance with international law and in the framework of the principles of the United Nations Charter  which regulates peaceful coexistence between nations. Indeed  we must uphold the ideals that inspired the establishment of the Organization. That is a civilizing project that we cannot abandon as it represents unfinished business that we owe it to ourselves and to generations to come to complete. "
"180",7259,"USA",63,2008,"I am pleased to be here to address the General Assembly. Sixty-three years ago  representatives from around the world gathered in San Francisco to complete the founding of the Charter of the United Nations. They met in the shadow of a devastating war  with grave new dangers on the horizon. They agreed on a historic pledge to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights and unite their strength to maintain international peace and security. That noble pledge has endured trying hours in United Nations history  and it still guides our work today.    9 08-51570   Yet the ideals of the Charter are now facing a challenge as serious as any since the United Nations founding: a global movement of violent extremists. By deliberately murdering the innocent to advance their aims  those extremists defy the fundamental principles of international order. They show contempt for all who respect life and value human dignity. They reject the words of the Bible  the Koran  the Torah or any standard of conscience of morality. They imperil the values of justice and human rights that gave birth to the United Nations — values that have fuelled an unprecedented expansion of freedom across the world.   To uphold the words of the Charter in the face of this challenge  every nation in this Hall has responsibilities. As sovereign States  we have an obligation to govern responsibly and solve problems before they spill across borders. We have an obligation to prevent our territory from being used as a sanctuary for terrorism  proliferation  human trafficking and organized crime. We have an obligation to respect the rights and respond to the needs of our people.   Multilateral organizations have responsibilities. For eight years  the nations in this Assembly have worked together to confront the extremist threat. We have witnessed successes and setbacks  and through it all a clear lesson has emerged. The United Nations and other multilateral organizations are needed more urgently than ever. To be successful  we must be focused  resolute and effective.   Instead of only adopting resolutions decrying terrorist acts after they occur  we must cooperate more closely to keep terrorist attacks from happening in the first place. Instead of treating all forms of Government as equally tolerable  we must actively challenge the conditions of tyranny and despair that allow terror and extremists to thrive. By acting together to meet the fundamental challenge of our time  we can lead towards a world that is more secure  more prosperous and more hopeful.   In the decades ahead  the United Nations and other multilateral organizations must continually confront terror. That mission requires clarity of vision. We must see the terrorists for what they are: ruthless extremists who exploit the desperate  subvert the tenets of a great religion and seek to impose their will on as many people as possible. Some suggest that those men would pose less of a threat if we would only leave them alone  yet their leaders make clear that no concession could ever satisfy their ambitions. Bringing the terrorists to justice does not create terrorism. It is the best way to protect our people.   Multilateral organizations must respond by taking an unequivocal moral stand against terrorism. No cause can justify the deliberate taking of innocent life  and the international community is nearing universal agreement on this truth. The vast majority of nations in this Assembly now agree that tactics like suicide bombing  hostage-taking and hijacking are never legitimate. The Security Council has adopted resolutions declaring terror unlawful and requiring all nations to crack down on terrorist financing. Earlier this month  the Secretary-General held a conference to highlight victims of terror  where he stated that terrorism can never be justified.  Other multilateral organizations have spoken clearly as well. The Group of 8 has declared that all terrorist acts are criminal and must be universally condemned. The Secretary-General of the Organization of the Islamic Conference recently spoke out against suicide bombing  which he said runs counter to the teachings of Islam.   The message behind those statements is resolutely clear. Like slavery and piracy  terrorism has no place in the modern world. Around the globe  nations are turning those words into action. Members of the United Nations are sharing intelligence with one another  conducting joint operations and freezing terrorists’ finances. While terrorists continue to carry out attacks like the terrible bombing in Islamabad last week  our joint actions have spared our citizens from many devastating blows.   The brutal nature of the extremists is increasingly clear and the coalition of nations confronting terrorists is growing stronger. Over the past seven years  Afghanistan and Iraq have been transformed from regimes that actively sponsor terror to democracies that fight terror. Libya has renounced its support for terror and its pursuit of nuclear weapons. Nations like Saudi Arabia and Pakistan are actively pursuing the terrorists. A few nations  regimes like Syria and Iran  continue to sponsor terror  yet their numbers are growing fewer and they are growing more isolated from the world.   As the twenty-first century unfolds  some may be tempted to assume that the threat has receded. That would be comforting. It would be wrong. The terrorists believe time is on their side  so they have made waiting    08-51570 10  out civilized nations part of their strategy. We must not allow them to succeed. The nations of this body must stand united in the fight against terror. We must continue working to deny the terrorists refuge anywhere in the world  including ungoverned spaces. We must remain vigilant against proliferation by fully implementing the terms of resolution 1540 (2004) and enforcing sanctions against North Korea and Iran. We must not relent until our people are safe from this threat to civilization.  To uphold the Charter’s promise of peace and security in the twenty-first century  we must also confront the ideology of the terrorists. At its core  the struggle against extremists is a battle of ideas. Terrorists envision a world in which religious freedom is denied  women are oppressed and all dissent is crushed. The nations represented in this Hall must present a more hopeful alternative — a vision where people can speak freely  worship as they choose and pursue their dreams in liberty.   Advancing this vision of freedom serves our highest ideals  as expressed in the United Nations Charter’s commitment to the dignity and worth of the human person. Advancing this vision also serves our security interests. History shows that when citizens have a voice in choosing their own leaders  they are less likely to search for meaning in radical ideologies  and when Governments respect the rights of their people  they are more likely to respect the rights of their neighbours.  For all these reasons  the nations of this body must challenge tyranny as vigorously as we challenge terror. Some question whether people in certain parts of the world actually desire freedom. This self-serving condescension has been disproved before our eyes. From the voting booths of Afghanistan  Iraq and Liberia to the Orange Revolution in Ukraine  the Rose Revolution in Georgia  the Cedar Revolution in Lebanon and the Tulip Revolution in Kyrgyzstan  we have seen people consistently make the courageous decision to demand their liberty.  For all the suggestions to the contrary  the truth is that  whenever and wherever people are given the choice  they choose freedom. Nations represented in this Hall have supported the efforts of dissidents  reformers and civil society advocates in newly free societies through the new United Nations Democracy Fund  and we appreciate those efforts. As young democracies around the world continue to make brave stands for liberty  multilateral organizations like the United Nations must continue to stand with them.  In Afghanistan  a determined people are working to overcome decades of tyranny and protect their newly free society. They have strong support from all 26 nations of the NATO alliance. I appreciate the United Nations decision this week to renew the mandate of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan. The United Nations also has an active civilian presence in Afghanistan  where experts are doing important work helping to improve education  facilitate humanitarian aid and protect human rights. We must continue to help the Afghan people defend their young democracy so that the Taliban does not return to power and Afghanistan is never again a safe haven for terror.  In Iraq  the fight has been difficult  yet daily life has improved dramatically over the past 20 months thanks to the courage of the Iraqi people  a determined coalition of nations and a surge of American troops. The United Nations has provided the mandate for multinational forces in Iraq through this December  and the United Nations is carrying out an ambitious strategy to strengthen Iraq’s democracy  including helping Iraqis prepare for their next round of free elections. Whatever disagreements our nations have had on Iraq  we should all welcome this progress towards stability and peace and we should stand united in helping Iraq’s democracy succeed.   We must stand united in our support of other young democracies  from the people of Lebanon struggling to maintain their hard-won independence to the people of the Palestinian territories  who deserve a free and peaceful State of their own. We must stand united in our support of the people of Georgia. The United Nations Charter sets forth the equal rights of nations large and small; Russia’s invasion of Georgia was a violation of those rights. Young democracies around the world are watching to see how we respond to this test. The United States has worked with allies in such multilateral institutions as the European Union and NATO to uphold Georgia’s territorial integrity and provide humanitarian relief. Our nations will continue to support Georgia’s democracy.  In this Hall are representatives of Georgia  Ukraine  Lebanon  Afghanistan  Liberia  Iraq and other brave young democracies. We admire their courage  we honour their sacrifices  and we thank them for their   11 08-51570  inspiring example. We will continue to stand with all who stand for freedom. This noble goal is worthy of the United Nations and it should have the support of every member of this Assembly.   Extending the reach of political freedom is essential to prevailing in the great struggle of our time  but it is not enough. Many in this Hall have answered the call to help their brothers and sisters in need by working to alleviate hopelessness. Those efforts to improve the human condition honour the highest ideals of this institution. They also advance our security interests. The extremists find their most fertile recruiting grounds in societies trapped in chaos and despair — places where people see no prospect of a better life. In the shadows of hopelessness  radicalism thrives. Eventually  that radicalism can boil over into violence  cross borders and take innocent lives across the world.   Overcoming hopelessness requires addressing its causes: poverty  disease and ignorance. Challenging these conditions is in the interest of every nation in this Hall  and democracies are particularly well positioned to carry out that work because we have experience responding to the needs of our own people. We are natural partners in helping other nations respond to the needs of theirs. Together  we must commit our resources and efforts to advancing education  health and prosperity.   Over the years  many nations have made well-intentioned efforts to promote these goals  but the success of these efforts must be measured by more than intentions. It must be measured by results. My nation is placing insistence on results at the heart of our foreign assistance programmes. We launched a new initiative  called the Millennium Challenge Account  which directs our help to countries that demonstrate their ability to produce results by governing justly  fighting corruption and pursuing market-based economic policies  as well as investing in their people. Every country and institution that provides foreign assistance  including the United Nations  will be more effective by showing faith in the people of the developing world and insisting on performance in return for aid.   Experience also shows that  to be effective  we must adopt a model of partnership  not paternalism. This approach is based on our conviction that people in the developing world have the capacity to improve their own lives and will rise to meet high expectations if we set them. America sought to apply this model in our Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. Every nation that receives American support through this initiative develops its own plan for fighting HIV/AIDS and measures the results.   So far  these results are inspiring. Five years ago  50 000 people in sub-Saharan Africa were receiving treatment for HIV/AIDS; today  that number is nearly 1.7 million. We are taking a similar approach to fighting malaria  and so far we have supported local efforts to protect more than 25 million Africans. Multilateral organizations have made bold commitments of their own to fight disease. The G-8 has pledged to match America’s efforts on malaria and HIV/AIDS. Through the Global Fund  many countries are working to fight HIV/AIDS  malaria and tuberculosis. Lives in the developing world depend on these programmes  and all who have made pledges to fight disease have an obligation to follow through on their commitments.   One of the most powerful engines of development and prosperity are trade and investment  which create new opportunities for entrepreneurs  help people rise out of poverty and reinforce such fundamental values as transparency and the rule of law. For all these reasons  many represented in this Hall have conducted free-trade agreements at the bilateral and regional levels.   The most effective step of all would be an agreement that tears down trade barriers at the global level. The recent impasse in the Doha round is disappointing  but that does not have to be the final word. I urge every nation to seize this opportunity to lift up economies around the world and reach a successful Doha agreement as soon as possible. Beyond Doha  our nations must renew our commitment to open economies and stand firm against economic isolationism. These objectives are being tested by turbulence in the global financial markets.   Our economies are more closely connected than ever before  and I know that many of you here are watching how the United States Government will address the problems in our financial system. In recent weeks we have taken bold steps to prevent a severe disruption of the American economy  which would have a devastating effect on other economies around the world. We promote stability in the markets by preventing the disorderly failure of major companies.    08-51570 12  The Federal Reserve has injected urgently needed liquidity into the system. Last week  I announced decisive action by the federal Government to address the root cause of much of the instability in our financial markets by purchasing illiquid assets that are weighing down balance sheets and restricting the flow of credit. I can assure the Assembly that my Administration and our Congress are working together to quickly pass legislation approving this strategy. And I am confident that we will act in the urgent time frame required.   The objectives I have laid out for multilateral institutions confronting terror  opposing tyranny and promoting effective development are difficult  but they are necessary tasks. To have maximum impact  multilateral institutions must take on challenging missions  and like all of us in this Hall they must work towards measurable goals  be accountable for their actions and hold true to their word.   In the twenty-first century  the world needs a competent and effective United Nations. This unique institution should build on its successes and improve its performance. Where there is inefficiency and corruption  that must be corrected. Where there are bloated bureaucracies  they must be streamlined. Where Members fail to uphold their obligations  there must be strong action — for example  there should be an immediate review of the Human Rights Council  which has routinely protected violators of human rights. There should be a stronger effort to help the people of Burma live free of the repression they have suffered for too long. All nations  especially members of the Security Council  must act decisively to ensure that the Government of the Sudan upholds its commitment to address the violence in Darfur.  The United Nations is an Organization of extraordinary potential. As it rebuilds its Headquarters  it must also open the door to a new age of transparency  accountability and seriousness of purpose. With determination and clear purpose  the United Nations can be a powerful force for good as we head into the twenty-first century. It can affirm the great promise of its founding.   In the final days of the San Francisco Conference  the delegates negotiating the United Nations Charter received a visit from President Harry Truman. He acknowledged the enormous challenges they faced and said that success was possible only because of what he called an unshakable unity of determination. Today  the world is engaged in another period of great challenge  and by continuing to work together  that unshakable unity of determination will be ours. Together we can confront and defeat the evil of terrorism. Together we can secure the Almighty’s gift of liberty and justice to millions who have not known it. Together we can build a world that is freer  safer and better for the generations who follow. "
"181",7282,"UZB",63,2008,"Allow me at the outset to congratulate Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session and wish him every success in his work.  In the context of the agenda of the current session of the General Assembly  I would like to address the following issues  which we consider to be of the utmost importance and are directly relevant to the security and sustainable development of the Central Asian region.  First are the issues related to the continuing intensification and escalation of confrontation in Afghanistan  the increasing radicalization of the situation and the provocative terrorist statements by the fighters. Despite the enormous efforts and measures by the international community and coalition forces to support peace in Afghanistan  the situation  unfortunately  is deteriorating. The civilians are perishing.  What further exacerbates the situation in Afghanistan is the growing volume of drug trafficking. Today the production of opium in Afghanistan accounts for more than 8 000 tons  or over 90 percent of global production. It must be taken into consideration that drug trafficking is becoming one of the important sources of financing for fighters  destabilizing the situation in Afghanistan itself and in neighbouring States.  From this high rostrum  I would like to state again that we are deeply convinced that recent developments in the situation in Afghanistan show ever    08-53129 20  more clearly that the Afghan problem cannot be resolved by the use of armed force  military means and increasing militarization alone. The war  which has been ongoing for close to 30 years  has destroyed both the economic and social infrastructure  led to the impoverishment of the population and  we must admit  has deprived people of any belief in a future and has provided fertile ground for recruiting more and more fighters.  The developing situation dictates the need to radically reconsider the approaches to resolving the Afghan problem. It is our firm belief that our main priorities must be providing targeted economic aid to Afghanistan  building and moulding economic and social infrastructure  ensuring employment opportunities and resolving the acute problem of combating poverty.  It is necessary to do everything we can to ensure respectful attitudes to national and religious values and the centuries-old traditions and customs of the multinational and multi-faith people of Afghanistan  and on that basis to bring together the conflicting forces. An important instrument for achieving such goals could be a return to the successful Six plus Two group on Afghanistan that successfully functioned in the middle of the 1990s under the auspices of the United Nations and transforming it into a Six plus Three group by taking into consideration contemporary realities and including in its make-up neighbouring States  Russia and the United States  and NATO.  As the President of Uzbekistan  Mr. Islam Karimov  has repeatedly underscored  the realization of such an initiative — which has already been called for from a number of international rostrums — could be a worthy alternative in achieving peace  stability and the revival of Afghanistan.  The outcomes of the high-level event on the Millennium Development Goals that took place on 25 September 2008 demonstrated that the international community needs to resolutely seek concrete results in achieving the goals in the sphere of development as formulated in the Millennium Declaration.  In that context  all of us share responsibility for the reasonable use of natural resources  including the transboundary rivers in Central Asia. Experience itself has shown that disregarding well-known United Nations declarations and international standards on the joint use of water resources of transboundary rivers can lead to very serious and at times tragic ecological disasters  as borne out by the ongoing catastrophe of the drying up of the Aral Sea  with all of its unforeseen consequences for the tens of millions of people in the region.  According to the fundamental provisions of United Nations conventions  all decisions on the use of the water of transboundary rivers in Central Asia  including the construction of hydropower facilities  must in no way inflict damage on the ecology of the region or infringe on the interests of the populations of neighbouring countries  nor should they upset the established balanced use of the water of transboundary rivers by all States in those rivers basins. In the case of damage  all measures must be taken to remove or mitigate such damage  and  if necessary  the issue of compensation must be raised.  We are convinced that compliance with those requirements must be mandatory in the implementation of various projects such as building hydropower facilities in Central Asia  including compliance by international financial institutions that wish to participate in such projects.  We are also convinced of the importance of expanding cooperation and strengthening interaction between the United Nations and the International Fund to Save the Aral Sea. In this respect  we consider it timely and necessary to grant the Fund observer status in the General Assembly  and we call upon Member States to support the draft resolution on this matter during the Assembly’s sixty-third session.  This year in Uzbekistan we will widely observe the sixtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  and a programme of action dedicated to that most significant event has been approved. As of 1 January 2008  Uzbekistan fully abolished the death penalty and introduced habeas corpus  a democratic principle of justice. The adoption of the law on guaranteeing the rights of the child and the ratification of the International Labour Organization Minimum Age Convention and Convention on the Worst Forms of Child Labour have become important steps in ensuring human rights in Uzbekistan. We have adopted a national plan for implementing the commitments undertaken in those Conventions. Aware of the urgency of the problem of human trafficking at both domestic and international levels  in April 2008 Uzbekistan adopted its law against human trafficking.    21 08-53129   Committed to the ideals and principles of human rights  Uzbekistan advocates gradual reforms and changes with the main purpose of ensuring peace in society and greater well-being of the people.  In conclusion  I want to underscore once again that Uzbekistan stands ready to engage in further constructive multilateral interaction within the United Nations framework to address the urgent issues on the agenda of the international community.

"182",7294,"VAT",63,2008,"As the last speaker on your list  Mr. President  I think I can congratulate you on this important debate  and quote the Latin saying  dulce est in fundo  which you know very well — sweetness comes at the end.  As you assume the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session  my delegation wishes you all the best in your endeavours and looks forward to working with you in order to address the many challenges facing the global community.  This general debate is an occasion for those responsible for the national life of every country to come together to take the pulse of the world situation. By its nature and structure  the United Nations normally creates neither events nor trends  but rather serves as a sounding board where events and trends are submitted for debate and a coherent  consensual and timely response.  This year has been dominated by a number of challenges and crises: natural and man-made calamities  staggering economies  financial turmoil  rising food and fuel prices  the impact of climate change  local wars and tensions. We have been called to this Hall once again to identify the common causes and denominators underlying those diverse crises and to craft adequate long-term solutions.  One of the clear facts  recognized by all  is that every crisis presents a mixture of natural factors and elements of human responsibility. However  they are all too often compounded by the tardy responses  failures or reluctance of leaders to exercise their responsibility to protect their populations.  When speaking within these walls of the responsibility to protect  the common understanding of the term is found in the 2005 World Summit Outcome Document  which refers to the responsibility of the international community to intervene in situations where individual Governments are not able or willing to assure the protection of their own citizens.  In the past  the language of protection was too often a pretext for expansion and aggression. In spite of the many advances in international law  that same understanding and practice tragically continues today. However  during the past year  in this same Hall there has been growing consensus and greater inclusion of this expression as a vital component of responsible leadership. The responsibility to protect has been invoked by some as an essential aspect of the exercise of sovereignty at the national and international levels  while others have relaunched the concept of the exercise of responsible sovereignty.  For his part  Pope Benedict XVI  in his address to the General Assembly last April  also recognized that  from the very ancient philosophical discourses on governance to the more modern development of the nation State  the responsibility to protect has served and must continue to serve as the principle shared by all nations in governing their populations and regulating relations between peoples. Those statements reassert the historical and moral basis for States to govern. Likewise  they reassert that good governance    08-53141 50  should no longer be measured simply within the context of a State’s rights or sovereignty  but rather by its ability to care for those who entrust it with the grave moral responsibility to lead.  We the peoples who formed the United Nations conceived the responsibility to protect as the core basis for the United Nations. The founding leaders believed that the responsibility to protect would consist not primarily of the use of force in order to restore peace and human rights  but rather in States coming together to detect and denounce early symptoms of every kind of crisis  mobilizing Governments  civil society and public opinion to find the causes and to offer solutions. The various agencies and bodies of the United Nations also reaffirm the importance of the responsibility to protect in their ability to work in close proximity and solidarity with affected populations and to put detection  implementation and monitoring mechanisms into place. It is incumbent not only upon States  but also upon the United Nations to ensure that the responsibility to protect serves as the underlying measure and motivation of all its work.  While many continue to question and debate the real causes and medium- and long-term consequences of the various financial  humanitarian and food crises around the world  the United Nations and its membership have the responsibility to provide direction  coherence and resolution. It is not only the credibility of the Organization and our global leaders that is at stake  but rather and more importantly the ability of the human community to provide food and security and to protect basic human rights so that all peoples have the opportunity to live with freedom from fear and want  thus realizing their inherent dignity.  One area in which our best intentions require urgent action is climate change. My delegation commends Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his leadership in recognizing the urgency of tackling that issue  and we commend States and civil society for making the necessary political and personal sacrifices to ensure a better future.  The challenge of climate change and the various solutions proposed and put into action have led us to call attention to a preoccupation and inconsistency existing today in the realm of international and national law — that all that is technically possible must be legally licit.  In adopting ever more stringent norms to protect the environment and nature  it is often rightly affirmed that not all environmental activity should be allowed and sanctioned by law just because it is technically possible and economically profitable. Indiscriminate deforestation  the dumping of radioactive waste and invasive and devastating acts on nature are often more expedient and technically possible  but because they provoke our conscience  as well as our responsibility towards creation  we decide to invoke the principle that even though it is possible it should not be legally licit.  However  when passing from the ecological field to that of humans  we have a tendency to affirm the opposite principle — that all which is technically possible should be legally licit and consequently pursued. Whether regarding the production of arms for war  biotechnological engineering  the taking of human life  reproductive technology or the structure of the family itself  we have the tendency to advocate that all which is technologically possible should also be legally licit. That inconsistency calls into question whether we truly place humans at the centre of decision-making.  The global community must come together to reverse that contradiction and engage in a political discourse that recognizes the centrality of humans in all aspects of political and technological development. The same principles that lead us to oppose unchecked technology and policies that destroy the environment should also guide us in our prudent use of technologies and the creation of policies that directly impact the lives of individuals. Short of that  we will succumb to an inconsistency that penalizes the individual and human society and risks paving the way towards the imposition of laws by the more powerful and the creation of a new mass of losers.  As we embark on this session of the General Assembly  we strive to fashion an Organization that reflects our highest and best intentions and carefully places the needs of all people  regardless of their economic and political standing  at the centre of our decisions and responsibility.

I am comforted by the knowledge that he has a full appreciation of the    08-52272 34  majesty of our landscape and seascape  the opportunities and challenges facing our region  and the nobility of our Caribbean civilization. Mr. President  your dream that another world is possible  as courageously outlined in your inaugural presidential statement  is both timely and prescient. I wholeheartedly endorse your call for frankness  democratization and a focus on the needs of the poor  all under the redemptive and transformative rubric of love and solidarity with our fellow human beings.  It is in that spirit of love and frankness that I come before the Assembly today. In all candour  I must affirm what you  Mr. President  have already concluded: that the United Nations  as the supreme multilateral institution of a profoundly troubled and iniquitous world  can and must do more  in the form of decisive action  to improve the condition of our planet  the living conditions of the less fortunate and the safety of our global family.  The late Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia once stated:  “Throughout history  it has been the inaction of those who could have acted  the indifference of those who should have known better  the silence of the voice of justice when it mattered most that has made it possible for evil to triumph.”  There can be no doubt that the right-thinking and civilized peoples of the world are aware of the challenges facing us and of the path to peace  prosperity  and progress upon which we must collectively embark. However  the work that we have entrusted to the United Nations is compromised by apathy and inaction by too many of us and by the crippling pursuit of narrow self-interest by a handful of powerful countries. In this session  we have an historic opportunity to reassert the relevance and credibility of this body by keeping the promises that we have made to ourselves and the world.  The United Nations is charged with tackling the weighty problems that beset the world  not with the refinement of the art of impotent diplomacy. I have no doubt that the principles concealed in the language of “mandate review”  “system-wide coherence” and “revitalization” are important  and doubly so to the professional diplomats who look inward rather than outward and who lose sight of the forest for the trees in their endless quest to choreograph the dancing of ever more angels on the head of a pin.   One year ago  I stood at this very podium and denounced the failure of the international community to end the genocide in Darfur. One year ago  there were promising  though belated  signs that the United Nations was finally beginning to act decisively in this regard. One year ago  I stated that “the force on the ground is still insufficient  its mandate is ambiguous and its emerging presence is years too late” (A/62/PV.10  p. 15). Today  one year later  I am shocked by our collective failures in Darfur. Last month  Force Commander Martin Luther Agwai compared his role to that of a boxer in the ring with his hands tied behind his back  because his promised force of 26 000 personnel is still less than 10 000 strong.   I thus reflect as to whether our promises of “never again” and our commitments to the memories of one million Rwandans mean anything  as the blood of hundreds of thousands of Africans again stains the soil of the continent and our collective conscience. As a people whose past and future are inextricably interwoven with the continent  we  the citizens of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  ask ourselves  in the words of the Caribbean Nobel Laureate from Saint Lucia  Derek Walcott  “How can I face such slaughter and be cool?! How can I turn from Africa and live?” The conflict in Darfur is over five years old  and the time has long since past for genuine international action to halt that unspeakable human tragedy.  While I congratulate the General Assembly on finally clearing the way towards intergovernmental negotiations on Security Council reform  it cannot be an illusory or insincere process. The credibility of the decisions made by the United Nations in the name of peace and security hinges on the existence of a Security Council that is democratic and representative of the regional and development diversity of our body.  As we are all well aware  the scarcities and escalating prices of basic foodstuffs have already led to riots and political instability worldwide and within our own Caribbean Community. While Saint Vincent and the Grenadines has confronted the crisis with a creative national food production plan that mixes agricultural incentives with education and assistance  our local measures are only ameliorative and cannot totally insulate us from what is largely an imported problem.   We are again buffeted by the winds of unequal trade liberalization  in which the agricultural subsidies of developed States force our own nascent   35 08-52272  agro-industries into an uncompetitive demise. We are witness to a world where crops are grown to feed cars while people starve  and where climate change ruins age-old farming and fishing livelihoods. The so-called food crisis that we now face is but a symptom of deeper structural flaws in our global economic system and consumerist culture. It represents the human face at the confluence of countless systemic flaws and poorly conceived strategies  including trade barriers  the mad rush to biofuels  adverse climate changes and anaemic development assistance. Any meaningful attempt to alleviate the suffering of the poor and hungry people of the world must start with those systemic issues and resist the urge to treat the symptoms while ignoring the disease and its causes.  The banana farmers of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines continue their heroic struggles to eke out a living in the face of international corporate greed  thinly disguised as principled globalization. Our farmers  tradesmen and private sector are still waiting for the oft-promised opportunities that supposedly accompany globalization. However  the evidence to date suggests that the international community has inadvertently institutionalized and entrenched poverty within a system of global winners and losers. The ironically titled Doha Development Round looks less and less like a negotiating process and more and more like a suicide pact within which the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the major economic Powers want everything and concede little or nothing to the poor and developing nations of the world.   The solutions to our economic crises hinge upon genuine negotiation and compromise in the interests of the world’s least privileged. We are ill-served by benign neglect  unequal enforcement and concepts of welfare colonialism. The recent troubles in the world’s premier financial and banking countries exacerbate the profound challenges facing developing nations.  Six years ago  world leaders gathered in Mexico and gave birth to the Monterrey Consensus  in which they pledged their objective to eradicate poverty  achieve sustained economic growth and promote sustainable development as we advance to a fully inclusive and equitable global economic system. I prayed at the time that the Conference would not devolve into a dragon’s dance upon a decorous platform of the finest diplomatic language which few are determined to embrace for action.   Six years later  Monterrey is remembered as the site of grand  unfulfilled commitments to the developing world  much as Africa recalls the empty promises of Gleneagles. The four decade-old promise to devote 0.7 per cent of gross national income to official development assistance remains more illusion than reality. Countries like ours are therefore forced to scour the globe for friends willing to partner with us for the development of our people  while others would rather sit in judgement of our development decisions and priorities than rise to offer a helping hand.   Saint Vincent and the Grenadines once again pleads with the international community to be cognizant of the plight of Taiwan’s 23 million people. Even though the United Nations historical neglect of the Taiwan issue has not been a source of pride  the Government of Taiwan has acted responsibly and without confrontation to subordinate many of its legitimate political claims into efforts aimed at reducing cross-Strait tensions  promoting peace and building relations with the People’s Republic of China.   The United Nations must now act to ensure the survival of that fledgling rapprochement. Taiwan should be encouraged on its path to peace by permitting its meaningful participation in the specialized agencies of the United Nations. Much as Taiwan’s vibrant economy is recognized through its participation in WTO  there is no compelling reason why its equally vibrant people should be denied participation in the World Health Organization and other specialized agencies.  The Caribbean is in the midst of its annual hurricane season and the awesome winds  sea surges and torrential rains of Gustav  Hanna and Ike have brought the issue of climate change into sharp relief. It is a matter of life and death to the people of the Caribbean and other small island developing States. Similarly  the cost of adaptation to the changes wrought by our industrialized brothers and sisters must be borne adequately and responsibly by those who have so profoundly altered our global environment.   Hurricanes remind us in the Caribbean of our existential oneness. Accordingly  the effort of Caribbean nations to fashion a more perfect union is to be fully supported as a vital strategic necessity.  The geographic happenstance that has placed the innocent people of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines in the path of increasingly intense storms has also located    08-52272 36  us unfortunately between the supply and demand that fuel much of the West’s narcotics trade. As a result  our scarce resources are increasingly being diverted to stem the tide of drugs and small arms flowing through our region.   To the people of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  disarmament means not the eradication of nuclear weapons  which we lack the will and resources to build  but the elimination of small arms  which threaten to shoot holes in the fabric of our democracy and compromise the values of our civilization. We are assailed by guns  which we do not build  and by deadly narcotics such as cocaine  which we do not produce. The United Nations must act to protect the innocent victims of the world from the scourge of small arms and light weapons.  In recent months  I have been profoundly troubled by the creeping return of cold war rhetoric to the language of international and hemispheric discourse. In this globalized and interconnected world  it is no longer possible to divide the planet into competing hemispheres or to completely quarantine or indeed blockade ideological foe from friend. We must guard against the return of discarded philosophies and learn from the recent past  in which developing countries were used as pawns and proxies for the hegemonic ambitions of others.   Our multipolar experiment is too young for the developing and globalizing world to return to the old rhetoric and recriminations that invariably blossom into violence and death  most often visited on the peoples of developing countries. It is my sincere prayer that this body will hew more closely to the principles of multilateralism and the sovereign equality of all States  and resist any pressures for the United Nations to devolve into a playground for the triumphalist ambitions of presumptive super-Powers.  Mr. President  you sit at the helm of a body entrusted with the well-being and safekeeping of humanity. We have gradually strayed from the noblest of our goals and increasingly paid only lip service to problems that are well within our ability to solve. In countless spheres  we have promised action. Let us now keep those promises for the good of our global family.  The poetic summation of the American poet Robert Frost is apt: “I shall be telling this with a sigh  Somewhere ages and ages hence:  Two roads diverged in a wood  and I —  I took the one less travelled by   and that has made all the difference.” Let us choose with courage the road less travelled by. Each of us can make a difference  accordingly. "
"184",7376,"VEN",63,2008,"For Venezuelans  Latin Americans and Caribbeans  it is an honour  Sir  to have you as President of the General Assembly at this session. No one is a more authentic Christian than a progressive Christian. It is a risky position and one which requires sacrifice for a person like yourself  whose life has been a testament to his lofty values. Indeed  this criterion is valid for Muslims  Jews  Buddhists  animists  Hindus  atheists  and so on if their lives are a testament to their respective ethical obligations.  There is another religion whose adherents and priests preach from their temples. It is the religion of neoliberalism  whose god is the market.  A few years ago  a well-known academic  captivated by his own materialistic image  announced the end of history  claiming that we had reached not the fountain of eternal youth but the secret to eternal prosperity. Today  prompted by the sixtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  we qualify that thought as a curse that reflects the insensitivity of the most egotistical and corrupt.  At the time of the French Revolution someone said “Freedom  how many crimes are committed in your name?” These days we could say “Free market     08-53141 22  how much poverty  how much violence  how much torture  how many wars  how many invasions  how much oppression  how much social injustice is committed in your name?” We are  therefore  sympathetic with President Nicolas Sarkozy’s peace initiatives and his appropriate ideas about a regulated capitalism and a summit of countries affected by the financial crisis.  Accustomed as we were to suffering the perverse effects of the brutal application of neoliberal policies  today we see the pain  anguish and anger of millions of our brothers in the United States. They have been swindled by upper-class criminals  an experience that we Venezuelans know well.  Since memory is fragile and the neoliberal global dictatorship uses private communications media to hide its crimes  allow me to recount a terrible event that occurred in the country that was the first lab rat for the most radical formula from Wall Street and the International Monetary Fund. I am speaking of my country  Venezuela.  In only two days  in February 1989  a spontaneous people’s rebellion was mercilessly crushed. It was a protest against the application  without anaesthesia  of the magic formulas that the great financial centres imposed on us. Several non-governmental human rights organizations at the time registered thousands of deaths  but the official statistics recognized only 259 dead  without mentioning those who were injured or material damage — only 259 dead in two days.  As a diplomat in those terrible days  I assumed that there would be complaints and condemnations from friendly Governments with good human-rights track records. Nothing of the sort happened. Venezuela was the pet project of Latin American democracies and  at the same time  a neoliberal laboratory whose failure had to be kept secret. The media accomplices of yesterday that kept these crimes secret are the same that today slander the democratic  peaceful  socialist revolutionary Venezuelan process led by President Hugo Chávez.  In Venezuela we practice extreme democracy: extreme freedom of expression  extreme participation  extreme challenge to the neoliberal monster and extreme commitment to social justice  hence the international media campaign to attempt to slander and stifle democracy in Venezuela. The instruments of that campaign have a name: the Fox network in the United States  the Grupo de Diarios de América  the Inter American Press Association  the neocolonialist group Promotora de Informaciones  S.A.  the El Pais daily  the Cadena de Ondas Populares de España (COPE) radio network of the blessed Catholic Bishops’ Conference of Spain  the El Mercurio daily in Chile  the El Universal daily in Mexico  the pro-coup Venezuelan television station Globovision  and many other lackeys of the international far right.  That brings to mind a topic that no one talks about. Some people think that Nelson Mandela did away with apartheid. In the United States  the people we see on the television screens are like the people we see in the streets. Not so in Latin America  in Venezuela and in multi-ethnic Latin American countries. On their televisions we do not see people of mixed races  nor indigenous people  nor Afro-Latin Americans unless they are playing the role of the servants. Hence the racist hatred against the indigenous majority in Bolivia. Racism is the most perverse form of discrimination. In the worst dictatorships and under persecution  it is possible to hide one’s thoughts  faith and political affiliation. But what one can never hide is the colour of one’s skin.  Democracy  international social justice and peace cannot survive under the schemes of unilateralism and the muscular exercises of hegemonic powers. Dissent should not be punished but rather recognized as an expression of democratic and pacifist values. Appreciation of and respect for those who are different is a guarantee of the fulfilment of the principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter. Democracy and peace should stem from creativity and the confidence generated by the variety of ideas  colours  interests and proposals.  Progressive democracy has burgeoned in Latin America and the Caribbean  particularly within the past 10 years  just as the continent has been undergoing profound social change. Long ago  during the sixties and seventies  the magic solution to attain the complete democracy and social progress that some preached was through free and transparent elections  although in certain select circumstances the elections were neither very democratic nor very transparent. Nevertheless  they were welcomed into the so-called democratic club  since they adhered to unspoken patterns of political behaviour dictated by the global metropolis.   23 08-53141   It is a fact that today in Latin America elections are more participatory  more transparent and freer than ever. Nevertheless  the results are not welcomed when the winners have previously been labelled as villains by the imperial super-Power.  The spectre of progressive democracy is lying in wait for the continent of social injustice. People are deciding their own destiny  as they should. But they are making this choice with a clear preference for leftist movements that offer a response to their circumstances. That does not suit the far right  which is no lover of democracy  as much as it claims to be.  That reminds me to some extent of Henry Ford  when he spoke of his great success in selling the Model T. He said “Any customer can have a car painted any colour that he wants so long as it is black”. Something similar is happening with the super-Power and its partners on our continent. Anyone who wins free and transparent elections monitored by credible international observers is accepted  provided that person is right-wing.  Dissent is not accepted by some people in the global village. The new movements  which are supported by the majority of those who are excluded  are not welcome. The magnates of private media are themselves a threat to democracy and freedom  aligning themselves with the interests they serve  while poisoning the collective psyche of the more timid groups in society.  Concerted efforts to undermine legitimate institutions are being launched and consolidated under fundamentalist doctrines. New witch hunts identify that phenomenon  and the fundamentalists of the right are embarking on well-coordinated and well-financed ventures while continuing to sign off on huge corporate deals. Such is the case with the Halliburton company  whose balance sheets are spattered with Arab and American blood. All the while  Al Qaeda is bigger than ever  and the weapons of mass destruction have still not been found.  Homegrown right-wing and racist forces  emboldened by foreign support  do not recognize the legitimacy of new or renewed institutions and cause political and social instability and separatism. Look at Bolivia. In Ecuador  those groups will not accept the overwhelming popular support provided yesterday to President Correa’s draft constitution  so we will have to invite him to come in and join the axis of evil.  In any case  there is not much to worry about when it comes to the leftist democracies. They are very modern  in the sense that they do not have religious or gender police  while on the other hand they are antiquated democracies  where those who gain the most votes come in first and are elected.  The drama of poverty  social exclusion and uneven distribution of income still tyrannizes our countries. The current model of development is not sustainable. It endangers life  the planet and peace. As long as there is still hunger  our democracies and our environment are threatened. The time for profound and demanding changes has come. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon  in his address to this Assembly at its 5th meeting  referred to the need for a new understanding on business ethics  with more compassion and less unconditional faith in the magic of the markets. Greed and consumerism have brought about climate change  the energy crisis  financial chaos and the food crisis.  The world food crisis continues to expand. Food has become just a form of merchandise used to maximize profits  with the human right to food ignored. According to the statistics of the Food and Agriculture Organization  global food production has consistently exceeded global population growth. That means that sufficient food is produced in the world to provide more than 2 800 calories every day to each of the world’s inhabitants. Close to 18 per cent more calories are produced per person than was the case in the 1960s  despite the increase in the total population. If sufficient food is produced in the world  how can we explain the fact that more than 850 million people now suffer from hunger or malnutrition  that 25 000 people die from hunger every day and that 18 000 of those are children?   The Secretary-General has stated that development is in a state of emergency  and he continues to appeal for progress on the Millennium Development Goals.  Venezuela promotes policies for social inclusion  public policies to ensure everyone’s rights. In order to build a new model for development on the basis of solidarity  social justice  equity  cooperation  respect for human rights and the participation of the people  Venezuela has a comprehensive social development policy based on the human being. The foundation of that policy is social missions undertaken through wide-ranging and free social and economic programmes to    08-53141 24  reach out to all sectors of society  with a particular emphasis on the most vulnerable  in order to guarantee the social and economic rights of our people in peace and democracy.  With great satisfaction and humility  our country can share with the Assembly the progress we have achieved in implementing the Millennium Development Goals. The number of people in extreme poverty has dropped in our country  and there has been an increase of 10.8 per cent in primary school attendance. Unemployment has dropped from 23 per cent to 7 per cent. In recent years  gross domestic product expenditures on health have increased by 57.1 per cent. We provide total coverage to those suffering from AIDS. The proportion of the population with access to drinking water has increased from 80 per cent in 1998 to 95 per cent in 2007. During the period from 1996 to 2007  infant mortality dropped from 23.4 to 13.4 per 1 000 live births.  Venezuela has made major contributions to efforts for cooperation and complementarity between the countries of the South. The Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas (ALBA)  which was established by Bolivia  Cuba  Nicaragua  Dominica  Honduras and Venezuela  is an initiative that brings together the abilities and strengths of its members to bring about structural change and the relationships necessary to achieve development and continue to exist as sovereign and just nations.  Petrocaribe is an energy cooperation agreement proposed by the Government of Bolivia to resolve the asymmetries in the region between energy producers and consumers by means of a new  equitable and just system of trade between the countries of the Caribbean region.  The Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) is an ongoing political endeavour  which  in its short existence  has shown that it is politically effective and respects the sovereignty of peoples. It has arrived at common positions on projects in the fields of energy  social affairs  finance  education  infrastructure  dispute resolution and defence  and has gone beyond mere talk to become part of daily life of the citizens of South America. The recent unanimous support of President Evo Morales and democracy in Bolivia is a good example of that.  The President of the General Assembly  Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann  stated that more than a half of the peoples of the Earth languish in hunger and poverty while ever-increasing amounts of money are wasted on arms  wars  luxury items and totally superfluous and unnecessary goods.  That addiction to war is the only thing that can explain the fact that  after the collapse of the Soviet Union  war-loving countries and alliances continued to chip away  day after day  at Russian democracy and to intrigue in the region against Moscow instead of abandoning their threats of war and trying to resolve the lack of trust that is the source of conflict and violence. It is a disgraceful situation that has not wanted for ignorant cowboys who think they are heroes. The Russian bear is awakening from its hibernation.  How many human lives have we lost among Iraqis  Americans  Latin Americans  Europeans  Asians and Africans? And how many lives could we save if the resources devoted to war and to the recovery of financial institutions were devoted instead to social investment?  The reform process requires the adoption of measures to strengthen the authority of the General Assembly  including on matters of international peace and security  given that it is the principal deliberating  participatory and democratic body of the Organization. Venezuela supports the expansion of both the permanent and non-permanent membership of the Security Council  the abolishment of the antidemocratic post-war mechanism of the veto and the improvement of the Council’s working methods  so that it may be more transparent and accessible and so that never again will anyone resort to lying to the Council.  We must remain vigilant to ensure that the Human Rights Council continues to operate on the basis of principles of impartiality  objectivity and non-selectivity without stigmatizing anyone and to promote constructive dialogue  without diversions about certification  cooperation without preconditions or vetoes  and respect for the particular circumstances of nations and regions  as well as for our diverse historical  cultural and religious pasts.  We reject racist  xenophobic and discriminatory measures that clearly deny the human rights that should apply universally to all  including migrants. Criminalizing migrants and their families violates their fundamental rights. Measures such as the Return   25 08-53141  Directive approved by the European Parliament incite racism  xenophobia and other forms of discrimination and intolerance. That is incompatible with the defence  promotion and protection of human rights  democracy and the rule of law. We prefer a Europe of light  integration and reconciliation to a Europe of shadows.  We know that we are not at the end of history; we are not even at the beginning of the end of history. What we do know is that we are apparently at the close of a chapter of history  at the end of a neoliberal nightmare in which unbridled capitalism — as John Paul II described it — social violence and the persistent worldwide violation of all human rights prevailed.  This afternoon  the House of Representatives of the United States of America took an historic decision whose effects will be felt throughout the world in the times to come. Very soon next year  we hope to be able to say that the worst has past and that the perverse effects of the religion of the market will be replaced  God willing  on the global level  allowing us to move towards democracy  progress and social justice  ensuring peace among nations — among nations that are free and stand together  among nations that are united.

"185",7415,"VNM",63,2008,"Allow me first to congratulate you  Sir  on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session. I am confident that you will ably guide our session to a great success. I would also like to commend His Excellency Mr. Srgjan Kerim for his important contribution to the work of the Assembly at its sixty-second session.  While the trend of peace  cooperation and development continues to prevail  there have been complex developments in the world over the past year. Local conflicts endure  acts of terrorism still occur in many parts of the world and new tensions have emerged in Europe  including in the Balkans and the Caucasus. At the same time  the world is experiencing the most severe economic uncertainties since the 1997-1998 financial crisis  together with new challenges such as climate change and the food and energy security crises. More than ever  the current situation compels nations to promote dialogue and cooperation to surmount common challenges  both man-made and natural.   Viet Nam supports efforts to end violence in Afghanistan and Iraq.   We should also work to facilitate further progress in the search for lasting peaceful solutions to the nuclear issues on the Korean peninsula and Iran on the basis of due respect both for the legitimate rights of States to develop and use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and for the regime of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.   In follow-up to the Annapolis outcome  I wish to reaffirm Viet Nam’s support for the role of the Quartet  the League of Arab States  regional countries and the United Nations  especially the Security Council  in the quest for a lasting solution in the Middle East. Such a solution should respect the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people  including their right to establish an independent State of their own  and the principle of land for peace.  As leaders of the world gathered here to discuss the development needs of Africa  we were keenly aware of the organic relationship between peace and development. Viet Nam undertakes to work closely with the United Nations and the African Union to find peaceful solutions to the conflicts and disputes that still rage on the continent.  New uncertainties are unfolding in the global economic and financial situation. Climate change and energy and food shortages are becoming more and more serious global issues. In the face of that situation  it is essential to enhance international cooperation to overcome these problems. In that regard  developed A/63/PV.13   08-53122 2  countries should take measures to maintain their macroeconomic and financial stability and implement international commitments to improve international economic relations and the transfer of technology. Such cooperation is possible and effective only when due regard is given to each country’s specific conditions  legitimate concerns and interests.  Given the complex developments in the world  the United Nations has a greater role to play in saving humankind from the scourge of war and in finding solutions to problems. The United Nations must be strengthened to that end. Democratic and comprehensive reform of the United Nations — including the General Assembly  the Security Council  the Economic and Social Council and the specialized agencies — will make the Organization more effective and efficient in the areas of work mandated by the Charter. Viet Nam will continue to contribute to efforts aimed at making the United Nations more democratic  more effective and more responsive to the needs of the peoples of the world.   In Viet Nam  the Government is working with United Nations agencies and other development partners to implement the One UN initiative. We hope and believe that the experiences of Viet Nam and the United Nations in implementing that pilot reform programme will be useful to other aid recipient countries and to the United Nations reform process overall.  In line with its foreign policy of independence  sovereignty  peace  cooperation and development and its efforts to deeply engage with the world  Viet Nam has seriously observed its commitments and actively participated in addressing global issues. We strongly support the Bali Road Map  which aims to establish the legal framework for international cooperation in addressing climate change beyond 2012. Despite natural disasters and epidemics  Viet Nam is honouring its commitments to maintain the volume of its rice exports at 4 million tons annually. We intend to continue those efforts to ease the pressures caused by the rising price of food and to preserve food security.  The year 2008 marks the first time that Viet Nam has assumed responsibilities as a non-permanent member of the Security Council. In its desire to make greater contributions to the maintenance of international peace and security  Viet Nam has participated in the work of the Council as a constructive and responsible member. We shall continue to uphold the principles enshrined in the Charter while working with other Council members and Members of the United Nations to find solutions that serve the interests of international peace and security and the legitimate interests of all countries and parties concerned.  In the 63 years since its establishment  the United Nations has traversed numerous upheavals of history and acquired an increasingly significant role in international relations. Against that backdrop  and with trust in the power of peoples’ will and determination to strive for peace  cooperation and development  we are strongly confident that the international community will overcome new challenges and that the United Nations will continue to live up to the expectations of all the peoples of the world.

"186",7446,"VUT",63,2008,"It gives me extreme pleasure to extend my congratulations to Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann on his election. I read with keen interest the United Nations news report of His Excellency’s election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session. I note well what he said on 4 June this year  following his election (see A/62/PV.99): for    08-52272 6  the United Nations to be more effective  it must be what its name implies — an organization of nations united  not nations dispersed or  even worse  subjugated. Our nations must be united in the struggle to democratize the United Nations  united in their determination to preserve the world for the sake of present and future generations from the scourge of war among Member States  and from acts of aggression.   I congratulate him and the Vice-Presidents on their election to lead the General Assembly. I believe that Mr. d’Escoto Brockmann’s election  as a leader in his own right  as a Christian priest and as a God-fearing servant of the Republic of Nicaragua  to the presidency of the Assembly is timely in these challenging days.  May I also extend my appreciation to His Excellency Mr. Srgjan Kerim for his successful leadership of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session.  I am deeply honoured to be the first President of the Republic of Vanuatu to address this Assembly  since it is the first time that a Head of State of Vanuatu has attended the United Nations since our admission to the Organization in 1981. In this respect  please allow me also to extend my congratulations to the Secretary-General on his appointment and on his keen commitment to revitalizing the United Nations.  I am humbled and privileged to stand before the sixty-third General Assembly to share some words and thoughts on behalf of the people of Vanuatu. Twenty-seven years ago  on 15 September 1981  Vanuatu became the 155th Member of the United Nations family. On that same day  our first and longest-serving Prime Minister and the founding father of our nation — the late doctor  chief and priest  Father Walter Hadye Lini — spoke to the Assembly in the name of the people of Vanuatu  with pride  humility and gratitude. He acknowledged the support of the United Nations through the active concern and assistance of the Special Committee of 24 on Decolonization.   Father Lini said that  because of that  the United Nations has a very special place in the affections and esteem of the people of Vanuatu. He also expressed our nation’s debt of gratitude to a great number of the countries represented in the Assembly  which assisted our nation’s difficult progress towards independence.  In the same spirit I call on the United Nations to continue to pursue the interests of those countries and peoples that continue their struggle for freedom and to win a permanent place among us. The United Nations is the Organization of the family of independent sovereign nations and peoples of the world. It must stand firm to promote peace  security and equality throughout the world.   The world’s majority has accepted the phenomenon of climate change as a reality and no longer an academic theory. From Kyoto to Bali  that observation has been consistently repeated.  The increase in the occurrence of natural calamities and their destructive powers are a stark reminder of the increasing vulnerability of today’s global environment  where nature respects no boundaries. The severe impact of natural disasters will constantly remind us of the harsh experiences and critical development challenges confronting many of the island countries.  I join my colleagues from the Pacific region in our call to the international community for more concerted action in addressing climate change as a security issue. Unless the present trend of global warming is reversed through sincere and concerted international action through the United Nations framework  some of our Pacific colleague nations will be submerged. If such a tragedy should happen  then the United Nations and its members will have failed in their first and most basic duty to a Member and its innocent people  as stated in Article 1 of the Charter of the United Nations.  In 2003  Vanuatu’s economic growth rebounded to 3.2 per cent from -2.6 per cent and -7.4 per cent in 2001 and 2002 respectively. Continued growth was recorded in 2004 and 2005  with a published growth rate of 5.5 per cent and 6.8 per cent respectively  driven mainly by growth in the service sector and  in particular  tourism.  As members know  a dimension of the least developed country (LDC) status is the tri-annual review by the Economic and Social Council of the list of least developed countries with the view to recommending countries for graduation out of or inclusion in the group of least developed countries. It is in that regard that I wish to bring to the attention of our Assembly to an area of serious concern to the Governments of Vanuatu and of several other small island developing States of the Pacific.   7 08-52272   It is our view that the current graduation rule poses a systemic issue that could easily be resolved if Member States were willing to recognize its importance to countries such as Vanuatu and other Pacific nations. The decision to graduate a country from LDC status  in our view  must imply the recognition of undisputed sustainable socio-economic progress in the country. The criteria the United Nations relies on to arrive at a decision are by and large sound and fair  and I will briefly recall them: first  one expects the country to enjoy a higher income per capita; secondly  the country’s human assets or human capital is expected to have made significant progress; and thirdly  the country ought to have achieved greater resilience to external shocks — in other words  to have become less vulnerable economically.  A country is recommended for graduation if it meets any two of those three criteria. In other words  the graduation rule implicitly postulates that all three criteria are equally important. If a country  no matter how vulnerable  has risen to a level of per capita income above $900  which is not difficult in a small State  and enjoys improved human capital  it is assumed that that country has become structurally stronger and is now ready to pursue its development efforts without LDC treatment.  Vanuatu and other Pacific countries believe it is critical to recognize the vulnerability criterion as the paramount criterion and accordingly give it prominence. It is indeed the only criterion that ultimately matters to small and vulnerable States such as ours.  Vanuatu and other Pacific countries are deemed eligible for graduation on the basis of their improved per capita income and improved human assets. They remain among the most vulnerable countries in the world  both economically and environmentally  and that must be recognized by the United Nations. Our countries may graduate from LDC status because they have achieved a higher per capita income performance  even though the sustainability of that income is constantly challenged by the high vulnerability of island economies to shocks such as frequent cyclones  earthquakes  volcanic eruptions and sea-level rise.  The recent hurricanes in this part of the world remind us of the destructive impact that such natural phenomena have on the development process of island countries and LDCs. Members may be aware that the “island paradox” — when relative prosperity overshadows high vulnerability — continues to be disregarded  despite the repeated call for a reform of the graduation rule that would make low vulnerability a sine qua non or compulsory criterion.  This is not the first time that Vanuatu  in addressing the Assembly  has called on the United Nations to reform the way least developed countries are identified. Some 11 years ago  in 1997  a former Prime Minister called for an urgent review of the LDC graduation criteria  which brought the United Nations to introduce a vulnerability criterion  a fair and sound move on the part of the Organization.  I reiterate Vanuatu’s plea for a reform of the graduation rule and wish to point out that the reform we are calling for is a mild and reasonable one  one that could easily be adopted by the Economic and Social Council and the General Assembly without altering the main components of the established methodology. We believe the time has come for the United Nations to come full circle by making the same criterion a superior one  so that no highly vulnerable country is forcibly reclassified and bound to lose the level of concessionary support of which it remains in need. Such a reform would do justice to countries that have not achieved the implied structural progress.  We are also urging experts from the Committee for Development Policy to seriously consider the merit of undertaking in-country visits to assess first-hand the development experiences of affected countries rather than making conclusions on statistical indicators that are anomalous and theoretical.  In 2004  the Government of Vanuatu established its Millennium Development Goals (MDG) National Committee  which adopted a plan of action to implement the MDGs. In its first report  in 2005  the MDG National Committee concluded that Vanuatu’s outlook for the achievement of the MDGs or their respective targets was poor to fair. That can be attributed to poor linkages to Government priorities and inadequate allocation of resources to implement the plan of action.   Nevertheless  we are pleased to report that in collaboration with the United Nations Development Programme  Vanuatu is endeavouring to put in place mechanisms to operationalize its sector strategies by identifying key issues and the  required interventions to address them  and defining the coverage of    08-52272 8  interventions and their costing. We believe that  if we succeed in doing that  we will be able to accelerate progress on the MDGs and that  come 2015  Vanuatu will be able to provide a more positive report to the Assembly.  At the Millennium Summit  the then Prime Minister of Vanuatu  The Honourable Barak Sope Maautamate  called on the United Nations to review the legality of the United Nations action in 1962 to endorse the New York Agreement to administer the  so-called Act of Free Choice over West Papua.  The Charter of the United Nations espouses the principles that continue to guide the Organization’s efforts in the process of self-determination. That manifestation calls for recognition and respect for the fundamental and inalienable rights of peoples and territories still under colonial rule to determine their future. We cannot champion democracy if the United Nations continues to hang this blanket of silence over the case of West Papua  in which the United Nations itself takes part.  An issue of extreme national importance is the question of submissions to the United Nations on the extension of continental shelves. As with some other smaller nations  technical capacity constraints and financial resources have inhibited our progress on submissions  and therefore we are requesting that the United Nations consider extending the deadline for submissions to enable countries like Vanuatu to participate fully in the process. We call for the understanding of our development partners and urge them to consider providing funding for that important exercise.  A side issue to the question of the extension of continental shelves in relation to Vanuatu is that there is a dispute between Vanuatu and the French Republic  the former colonial authority  concerning our continental shelves to the south of the nation.   On the question of reforms at the United Nations  we believe that  in order to make the Organization truly democratic  reforms are essential to make the Security Council more representative of the membership as a whole. In that respect  we believe that Japan and India deserve permanent membership.  At this critical moment of global crisis  I recall the aphorism underpinning the foundations of the United Nations. It is taken from the book of the great prophet Micah and is engraved on the walls of United Nations Headquarters:   “They shall beat their swords into ploughshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation shall not lift up sword against nation  neither shall they learn war any more” (The Holy Bible  Micah  4:3).  It is no coincidence that the theme for this Assembly is a much clearer manifestation of those prophetic words  which the United Nations has neglected over the years. As one of the smallest Members of the United Nations family of nations  Vanuatu reaffirms its commitment to building global peace and security. We also remain committed to supporting United Nations peacekeeping missions as our modest contribution to that worthy cause.  Finally  we welcome 2009 as the International Year of Reconciliation. We all hope and pray that it will be a time for real compromises and political goodwill. We encourage all members of our family of nations to approach 2009 with open hearts. If we are to turn the tide of tension and animosity  we must have the courage to reconcile our differences and come together in those dimensions that will enhance this noble Organization’s role in peacebuilding and development.  In closing  I would like to express the Government of Vanuatu’s gratitude to all our development partners who have generously contributed to Vanuatu’s development efforts. In particular  we wish to thank Australia  China  the European Union  New Zealand  Japan  the United States of America and France. We would also like to acknowledge the support of other partners  including India  Turkey  South Korea  Malaysia  Indonesia and Canada  as well as such multilateral institutions as the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank  and other United Nations agencies.  Mr. Baugh (Jamaica)  Vice-President  took the Chair.  We are living in perilous times. In our Father’s hands were we created  and to the hands of the leaders of the world He has entrusted the responsibility to ensure a world safe and just for all His peoples and children. The world’s destiny is in our hands. That must be our inspiration.   9 08-52272   May God bless the United Nations. May God bless the sixty-third session of the General Assembly. May God bless us all. "
"187",7478,"WSM",63,2008,"The United Nations embodies multilateralism. It is living testimony of the intergovernmental process at work. Samoa’s membership of the United Nations is grounded on the promise of the hope  equality and justice the United Nations offers the Member States  irrespective of their economic  political or military strengths. Looking back  our Organization has not lived up to the lofty goals enshrined in its Charter. Its credibility has been tarnished and undermined  and its performance questioned at times.  Yet  those perceived failings of our Organization are of our own making when we allow the vested interests of a few to take precedence over the urgent and deserving needs of the majority; when we accept flawed perceptions that certain issues  States and regions are more important than others  distorting the world’s focus and the allocation of resources; when we turn a blind eye and let the numerical superiority of groups or the importance of some stakeholders frustrate informed discussions of critical issues to score points and achieve symbolic wins that help no one in the long run; and when the long list of broken promises and unfulfilled undertakings couched in eloquent yet meaningless rhetoric creates frustration and mistrust among Member States.  The end result is that if no one takes responsibility  the future of the United Nations will be in doubt and the cost to the world incalculable. We have no one but ourselves to blame for any deficit in the credibility of our Organization. What we urgently need is a collective sense of trust and commitment to its Charter. Only then will the United Nations remain relevant and regain the confidence of our Members.  There is too much at stake for the world to just sit idly by. Strong global leadership is at a premium. Governments must yield not to vested interests and expediency  but because it is the ethical and the just thing to do.  That was my message from this rostrum last year  and I am happy to restate it again today. No Member State is too powerful or too small not to be part of the solution of making the United Nations an agent of change and a beacon of hope during these challenging times. And no contribution is too trivial or unimportant not to matter. For States in leadership positions  the   29 08-52272  ideal is to lead with humility  fairness and a kind heart. The world expects nothing less. Leadership and responsibility are  after all  one and the same.  Clearly  Member States can only do so much. We need a committed Secretariat that is aware of and sensitive to the needs of the people it serves. That is a non-negotiable prerequisite. Samoa supports the Secretary-General’s vision of creating a professional career service that is flexible and mobile enough to allow for quick and positive responses to the diverse demands of Member States. The need for the United Nations to deliver as one entity cannot be overemphasized. It adds value and quality to the process  eliminates waste  minimizes overlaps and ensures that the scarce resources entrusted to its care are used optimally to supplement Members States’ hard-earned efforts.  Right now our world is facing a difficult and troubled time. As members of the global community  our futures are inextricably linked. For Samoa  the small size of our country  its isolation from the major markets and permanent vulnerability to climate change are factors beyond our control. Yet even as a least developed small island nation that has made little or no contribution to the causes of today’s crises  Samoa is not shielded from their immediate negative impact and long-term consequences.  Global crises  as we know from bitter experience with global warming  energy and food prices  and now with the mayhem in financial markets that threatens to engulf the world  affect all our nations irrespective of whether we contributed to those crises or not.  This is why  in spite of shortcomings in the Organization  the United Nations remains the only viable institution that draws all the nations of our world together. However  the need to revitalize the General Assembly and to reform the Security Council has been obvious for many years. In the case of the Security Council  as long as its current composition and rules ignore today’s realities  it will continue to struggle to effectively carry out its intended tasks  as we have seen it do over many years.   Samoa remains firm in its position that the permanent and non-permanent membership categories of the Security Council should be expanded. Member States with legitimate credentials should be encouraged to stake their claims. Importantly  the intergovernmental process should commence in earnest during the current session to bring finality to an issue that has taxed Members States’ patience and endurance for over a decade and a half.  At the very minimum  the unanimous support of the current permanent members of the Security Council is a must. We hope  therefore  that candidate States and permanent members will reach out to each other in good faith and set aside the barriers that continue to frustrate the reforms to the Security Council that we all know must be made.  One observation that has been made over many years is that there seems to be indifference  whether intended or not  on the part of some of the leader nations of our Organization towards small and economically weak States  which  while they observe good governance and practice sound economic management  are nevertheless faced with the constant struggle to sustain and maintain the hard-won gains on those fronts.  Paradoxically  the only time those struggling States get noticed is when they are tottering on the brink or in the process of becoming failed States. By then  the cost in salvage action and remedial programmes is enormous. Therefore  the willingness of leader nations to listen and to try and understand early on the problems of States struggling to sustain good governance and economic management would go a long way towards creating effective partnerships  deploying scarce resources efficiently  and engendering goodwill and trust in the process.  Troubled spots around the world are on the rise  including in our own Pacific region. Some are occasioned by outside forces and influences  and others through domestically induced factors. Notwithstanding our differences  we all aspire to the same values in life. Hence  we must heed the lessons of history and provide appropriate encouragement and interventions to help States restore good governance and abide by the principles of democracy.  Yesterday’s high-level meeting on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) was a timely reminder  not of what we have achieved by the midway point  but what decisive actions must be taken urgently if the time-bound targets set at the dawn of the new millennium are to be met. Samoa participated in the recent Accra meeting on aid effectiveness  which further refined the pathways to the MDGs review just concluded and the International Conference on    08-52272 30  Financing for Development in Doha in November 2008.  Our strategic plan for 2008 to 2012 is a comprehensive development framework linked to the budget process for the implementation of the MDGs  with strategic targeting of those goals on which we have seen minimal progress through priority resource allocation.  We are grateful to the Governments of the People’s Republic of China and the United Kingdom for their support through debt relief. Similarly  we want to acknowledge the innovative partnerships in which we are engaged with our development partners  both old and new  giving us full ownership of the process in our quest to achieve as many of the MDGs as we possibly can.  In September 2007  during the 2007 South Pacific Games in Samoa  my Government worked closely with the United Nations system and others to promote the achievement of the MDGs. One innovative way of using sports as a vehicle to effect change in behaviour and to relay development messages was the installation of a solar-powered “MDG scoreboard” in front of a Government building to monitor national progress towards the MDGs.  Climate change continues to play a pivotal role in the decisions of the leaders in our region. Our Pacific Islands Forum meeting in August 2008 adopted the Niue Declaration on Climate Change. Our Forum communiqué  issued at the same summit  highlighted the vulnerability of Pacific small island developing States to the impacts of climate change. The European Union and the Pacific Islands Forum Troika agreed last week to work together to highlight the ongoing vulnerability of Pacific islands to the impacts of sea-level rise. Our representatives to the United Nations are working with like-minded countries to bring to the fore the security implications of climate change.  In total  those efforts and partnerships should convince those in denial that climate change is real. Its effects have already been felt by some of our Pacific island States  and for some low-lying islands climate change is an existential issue and their long-term survivability is at stake.  Only through selfless and concerted efforts by all countries  led by the major greenhouse gas emitters  can we have a fighting chance of lessening the destructive impact of climate change and enhancing the chances of a credible post-Kyoto agreement beyond 2012. To reach that goal  the Bali Road Map — with its four pillars of adaptation  mitigation  finance and technology — should be supported both in word and in deed.  The unpredictable weather patterns of recent times  affecting all regions of the world  are a sober reminder of our limitations as human beings against the force of natural elements no matter how good and technologically sound our preparations are. We need a global response if we are to succeed. Samoa was pleased  therefore  to see Australia take its place as a State party to the Kyoto Protocol at the Bali meeting. We remain optimistic that  either through a change of heart or through new circumstances  other countries will join the Kyoto Protocol to strengthen the implementation regimes of the Convention.  I mentioned last year the offer of the United Nations system to establish an inter-agency climate change centre in our country for coordinated support to Pacific island countries and regional organizations for climate change mitigation  adaptation and disaster risk reduction. Given the clear importance to the Pacific region of the project  Samoa has allocated land — 16 acres in all — on which to locate the centre and awaits the provision of the necessary resources by the United Nations so that the facility  which is already public knowledge in the region  can be constructed.  Samoa continues to support United Nations peacekeeping efforts worldwide. Small as we are  Samoan police continue to serve side by side with officers from other countries in Liberia  the Sudan and Timor-Leste as part of our ongoing commitment. Within the Pacific region  our solidarity in confronting the challenges facing our neighbours ensures a guaranteed Samoan police presence in the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands under the umbrella of the Pacific Islands Forum.  A durable peace settlement in the Middle East continues to elude us  but that does not constitute grounds to be pessimistic. We should support every effort to create conditions conducive to the creation of an independent Palestinian State alongside a secure and safe State of Israel.  Finally  those bent on creating fear and panic throughout the world will stop at nothing to achieve their aims. We must not be held hostage to their   31 08-52272  devious designs. Individually and collectively  we must step up our efforts to combat the threat of international terrorism in its many manifestations. No country can succeed on its own. Only by working collaboratively can we be successful. "
"188",7524,"YEM",63,2008,"I should like to start by congratulating Mr. d’Escoto Brockmann on being elected to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session. I am certain that he will steer the work of this session wisely and successfully  and we wish him every success in his work. I also wish to pay tribute to his predecessor  Mr. Srgjan Kerim  and thank him for his constructive efforts and the results that he achieved at the sixty-second session. On the occasion of the feast of Ramadan  I wish to extend my warmest greetings to the Islamic community and to all States of the world. May that feast bring prosperity  peace and security to all.  Without doubt  representatives closely monitored the terrorist acts perpetrated on the United States embassy  which were combated by our courageous Yemeni security forces. While we join the international community and the Security Council in condemning that terrorist act  we welcome the readiness of many countries to work on a daily basis to counter terrorism. We hope that such positive attitudes will translate into genuine support that will enhance human development projects and enable Yemen to overcome poverty by also strengthening the Yemeni security forces  so that they can play an effective role alongside the international community in countering terrorism. We also need increased cooperation and coordination among security and intelligence services at the international level so as to close all the gaps that have enabled terrorists to continue their destructive activities  which are alien to the values of religion and human morals.   Because of the exorbitant costs that we have had to bear in the field of security  Yemen has paid a heavy toll in terms of lives and material damage in the anti-terrorist activities that we undertake. Terrorist activities carried out by Al-Qaida and Islamic jihad elements  as well as by rebel movements  have caused tremendous economic losses of over $2 billion to the Yemeni Government and impeded the implementation of development projects and Government measures to reduce poverty. We therefore call on donor States  international organizations and Yemen’s partners in   13 08-53135  counter-terrorism to assist Yemen generously and to help it carry out the development projects and poverty-reduction programmes that are key components in countering terrorism  especially since terrorists exploit poverty  need and ignorance to polarize people and recruit individuals.  In the war on terrorism  in its various forms  many people have falsely found a pretext to mobilize against the Muslim religion  since Islam is the religion of dialogue  tolerance and moderation. In that connection  the Republic of Yemen fully supports the initiative of His Majesty the King of Saudi Arabia with regard to dialogue among religions — an initiative that attracted great attention at the Madrid conference. There is also a crucial need to fight terrorism around the world by reviewing counter-terrorism mechanisms so that the war on terror will not harm the lives of innocent citizens and cause human rights violations.  The Republic of Yemen  which is one of the least developed countries  continues to progress towards democratization through political plurality and freedom of expression  and is striving to promote the role of non-governmental organizations and civil society and the principle of the peaceful sharing of power. Yemen is moving from a local administration system to one of local governance that grants broad prerogatives in the area of decentralization and power-sharing. Parliamentary elections will take place in 2009 with the participation of various political parties. The Republic of Yemen  in that regard  intends to take all measures to safeguard the integrity of those elections  complying with international standards and welcoming the participation of international observers.   This session of the General Assembly is taking place in difficult international circumstances  with a new cold war threatening to return to the world and to undermine global peace and stability. We believe that this important international forum should be an instrument for resolving all issues and challenges and their implications for international relations. We trust that  through dialogue  non-interference in the internal affairs of countries and respect for the interests of all  we will be able to prevent a return to the age of alliances  because the world now has a crucial need for international cooperation in a spirit of pluralism and partnership instead of further tension and polarization.   The changes on the international scene are multiple. The most important facets are related to the international economic situation  which has confronted us with a number of unprecedented challenges. Among those challenges is the severe shortage of foodstuffs  the increase in the cost of food internationally and the rise in energy prices. Those acute crises threaten to affect the economies of poor countries  in particular by increasing the number of hungry people around the world. They are further compounded by industrial States’ growing use of biofuels  which poses a threat to the world’s current food reserves. While we agree that biofuels do help to reduce damage from global warming  that equation might change entirely if we were to take into account the potential effect on a large proportion of the world’s population  who may be facing famine. Food must be produced in the interests of the mass of humanity.  Poor countries are facing a major challenge because of the increase in the prices of food and energy. Whenever there are glimmers of hope on the horizon for developing countries  they find themselves facing new obstacles to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). There can be no doubt that  in order to address such difficulties  we need increased international solidarity and cooperation. We call on the major economic Powers and countries that produce energy and food to fully shoulder their responsibilities vis-à-vis the poorest countries and to help them to achieve development and the MDGs adopted by this Assembly in 2000.  The difficult humanitarian situation of the Palestinian people  whose rights continue to be denied and trampled by Israel  is a source of grave concern for us. Moreover  Israel’s expansionist policies of building illegal settlements on Palestinian and Syrian territories and of the racist separation wall in the West Bank  which have been condemned by the international community and the International Criminal Court  are creating further problems and placing new obstacles in the path of the peace process in the Middle East. We call on all parties  including the Quartet  to act to build a climate favourable to the restoration of trust among the parties concerned in the peace process so as to attain comprehensive and just peace.   It is high time to put an end to the procrastination policies of Israel. We greatly deplore the fact that Israeli occupation forces are committing offences in the holy sites in Jerusalem  which are among the most sacred to Muslims. We warn the occupying Israeli forces not to persist in such measures because  besides    08-53135 14  their potential impact on the peace process  they may also have uncontrollable and unforeseeable consequences. We believe it essential to adopt resolutions without delay to provide for the protection of the holy places and religious symbols  whatever they may be  while firmly condemning any prejudice or damage that may be done to them.   We warmly welcome the positive developments in Iraq. We also welcome the improved security situation and hope to see greater political stability in that fraternal country. From this rostrum  we welcome measures taken by the Iraqi Government to establish a timetable to end the presence of coalition forces on Iraqi territory as a major step towards its recovery of security  peace and stability and in order to protect its Arab identity and strengthen its national unity and role in the region.   We are also closely monitoring with great satisfaction the positive results achieved in Lebanon and the work being carried out by the Arab Group under the auspices of sisterly Qatar. We hope that the agreement between the various Lebanese parties and between the Syrian Arab Republic and Lebanon will also be successful. Security and stability must be strengthened in that region  and we hope that those agreements will play an important role in enhancing prosperity and peace for our neighbours in Iraq and Lebanon.  The Republic of Yemen is deeply concerned by attempts to interfere in the internal affairs of the Sudan  and we reaffirm the importance of respecting the sovereignty  territorial integrity and independence of that country. We call on the international community to fully assume its responsibilities in Darfur  and we encourage dialogue between the Sudanese Government and the various factions  considering any party that rejects dialogue and reconciliation and that resorts to violence to be a terrorist entity imperilling peace and stability. We also welcome the African and Arab efforts to resolve the Darfur problem and to nullify the negative impact of the decision of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court. We once again express our repudiation of politicized decisions by international judicial and humanitarian organizations that infringe on the sovereignty of States and interfere in their internal affairs.  Instability in Somalia has negatively affected countries of the region and is threatening the safety and security of navigation in international waters  as a result of the worsening phenomenon of piracy.   As members are aware  the number of refugees is constantly rising. Those refugees  who number approximately 500 000  have come to Yemen from the Horn of Africa. Millions in Somalia and in the Horn of Africa are threatened by famine  which could increase the number of refugees and thus the burden borne by the Government of Yemen. Therefore  we call for greater international support to help Yemen cope with the waves of refugees and to help Yemeni coast guard forces to combat piracy.  The situation in Somalia poses a challenge to the international community and requires serious efforts to achieve peace and security for the Somali people in order to enhance security and stability in the Horn of Africa. In that connection  we welcome Ethiopia’s readiness to withdraw its forces from Somalia and reaffirm the need to deploy international forces to restore stability there. We also call on all Somali parties to seek reconciliation and end their disputes  bearing in mind the interests of the Somali people  and we urge all external actors to refrain from interfering in Somalia’s internal affairs.  My delegation stresses the need to continue the process of United Nations reform. We reaffirm our resolve to join all other countries of the world in contributing effectively to the attainment of that objective. We believe that such reform is necessary and important and that all must join in the efforts to achieve it. Of particular importance is reform of the Security Council  which should not be limited to expanding its membership  but should ultimately result in more rational use of the right of veto so that it can no longer be used to block resolutions approved by the vast majority of the membership.   In closing  on behalf of Yemen  I wish to thank the Secretary-General for his unstinting support  efforts and guidance at the head of the Organization. "
"189",7562,"YUG",63,2008,"In 1945  on the heels of the most destructive conflict the world had ever seen  facing an uncertain future characterized by the threat of nuclear annihilation  the United Nations was established by men and women of strategic vision. In San Francisco  my country proudly sat among the Organization’s founders.  Our courageous political ancestors created this Organization in the belief that international law  based on the doctrine of sovereign equality of States  must supplant the use of force to settle differences between nations. This core abiding conviction of the founders must be repeatedly reconfirmed. The founders’ sense of purpose must also be reaffirmed. And the obligation they handed down to us must continue to be exercised by all with a solemn sense of responsibility.  However much the world has changed since 1945  the United Nations remains the only universal intergovernmental institution that unites us as a global community of sovereign States. And standing at the very heart of this indispensable Organization is the General Assembly  the ultimate source of the international system’s legitimacy. The unique world forum that is the General Assembly brings us together as sovereign equals  each acting on behalf of a country  with one vote  as guaranteed by the Charter of the United Nations.  The sacrosanct character of the foundational doctrine of sovereign equality and its accompanying binding obligation to respect each other’s sovereignty and territorial integrity constitutes the very nature of the enduring legitimacy of the United Nations.  This arrangement has not changed  and I believe it must not change — unless we seek to overthrow the Charter and overturn the global legal order upon which it is built.  I come before the General Assembly as the President of a country that has become caught up at the heart of one of the most dangerous challenges to the   29 08-51570  nature of the international system since the founding of the United Nations. I speak of the unilateral  illegal and illegitimate declaration of independence by the ethnic Albanian authorities of our southern province of Kosovo and Metohija  a territory that stands at the crucible of the identity of the Serbian people. It is the essential link between our proud national past and our proud European future. It is what ties the living tradition of Serbia to itself today.  The attempt at secession took place on 17 February 2008  in direct violation of the Charter of the United Nations  the Helsinki Final Act and Security Council resolution 1244 (1999). Kosovo’s ethnic Albanian leaders chose to take that unilateral step after walking away from the negotiating table. They believed that if they walked away  the path to securing independence would open up before them. They believed it because that is what they were told. And they believed it because an artificial deadline on the talks was affirmed from the outside  after which  if no compromise solution was reached  Kosovo’s independence would be imposed.  Under such circumstances  a negotiated solution was never a realistic option. With a fixed deadline and a default position that fulfilled the maximalist demands of Kosovo’s ethnic Albanians  what incentive did they have to negotiate with Serbia in good faith? All they had to do was to pretend to engage in a process predetermined to fail and wait out the clock.  The incentives for compromise were far outweighed by the incentives for maximalism. The result was the rejection of Serbia’s reasonable offer of almost unrestricted self-government  the broadest possible autonomy one can imagine.  Kosovo’s unilateral declaration of independence (UDI) amounts to an attempt to partition a State Member of the United Nations against its will  and with disregard for the firm opposition of the Security Council  in order to appease a volatile and threatening ethnic minority. As a result  the very nature of the international system has been called into question.  We all know that there are dozens of Kosovos throughout the world  just waiting for secession to be legitimized  to be turned into an acceptable norm. Many existing conflicts could escalate  frozen conflicts could reignite  and new ones could be instigated.  We have heard the argument that Kosovo is sui generis  that it is a unique case. But the truth is  that is tantamount to saying that Kosovo is an exception to international law  that Kosovo should stand beyond the rules that govern the behaviour of the international community.  The Republic of Serbia rejects that claim  believing that no people is authorized to declare itself an exception  especially when doing so is in defiance of the position taken by the Security Council.  We face a defining moment. We must stand together in steadfastness and determination against a fundamental violation of international law.  Serbia responded to Kosovo’s UDI with utmost responsibility and restraint. Despite political turmoil  our country continued to work hard to contribute to maintaining regional stability. From the very onset of this grave crisis  Serbia has ruled out the use of force. And we have not exercised other unilateral options  such as the imposition of economic sanctions against our breakaway province. Instead  we have opted for a peaceful and diplomatic approach  the result of which is that a vast majority of States Members of the United Nations have refrained from recognizing Kosovo’s UDI. They have continued to abide by their obligations under the Charter of the United Nations to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of my country. On behalf of the Republic of Serbia  allow me once again to sincerely thank these countries for their adherence to the principles of international law.  Serbia proposes a non-confrontational way to respond to the threat posed to its territorial integrity. We have chosen to use the law. While rejecting violence and unilateralism categorically  we are equally emphatic in demanding that justice be delivered through the proper legal means at the disposal of any State Member of the United Nations. To that end  the Republic of Serbia has submitted a draft resolution to be considered at this session of the General Assembly. Let me make it clear that the text of the draft resolution refrains from taking political positions on Kosovo’s UDI. Instead  in simple and direct language  it asks the principal judicial organ of the United Nations — the International Court of Justice — to render an advisory opinion on the following question: “Is the unilateral declaration of independence by the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government of Kosovo in accordance with international law?”    08-51570 30   We believe that sending the Kosovo question to the International Court of Justice would prevent the crisis from serving as a deeply problematic precedent in any part of the globe where secessionist ambitions are harboured. We also believe that an advisory opinion from the Court would provide politically neutral yet judicially authoritative guidance to many countries still deliberating on how to approach Kosovo’s UDI in line with international law.  Members’ votes in support of the draft resolution would serve to reaffirm another key international principle at stake: the right of any State Member of the United Nations to pose a simple  elementary question on a matter it considers vitally important to the competent court. To vote against is in effect to vote to deny the right of any country  now or in the future  to seek judicial recourse through the United Nations system. To vote against means to accept that nothing can be done when secessionists in any part of the world proclaim the uniqueness of their cause and claim exception to the universal scope of international law. Such an attitude could lead to the end of the United Nations system as we know it. Allow me therefore to formally ask for the support of each and every Member State for Serbia’s proposal before the General Assembly.  While the International Court of Justice deliberates on the legality of UDI  Serbia will remain a good-faith partner in the interim administration of our southern province. The functionality of a reconfigured international civilian presence under the overall authority of the United Nations  as defined by resolution 1244 (1999)  is of great importance to my country. It must remain status-neutral and cannot therefore be based on the so-called Ahtisaari proposal  which was rejected by Serbia and not approved by the Security Council.  It is well known that the European Union (EU) has committed itself to building the much-needed institutional and societal fabric of our southern province. Let there be no doubt: My country supports the deepening of Europe’s engagement in any part of Serbia  including Kosovo. In order for Europe’s presence in Kosovo to be fully anchored within an acceptable  legitimate framework  it is vital that its mandate be approved by the Security Council. We will work with the Member States and the Secretariat to ensure that we achieve consensus in the near future on the international civil presence in our southern province.  In conclusion  I want to emphasize that the central strategic priority of the Republic of Serbia is rapid accession to the European Union. Serbia will join the EU not only for reasons of geography  heritage  and economic prosperity  but also because of the values we hold in common. They constitute the intangible greatness of twenty-first-century Europe and they form the foundation of our democracy  our society and our beliefs in what we can accomplish.  Our common values also point to the significance of reconciliation — an important reason why Serbia is fully cooperating with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. We have demonstrated our unequivocal commitment time and again. We will continue to do so because it is our  duty — our legal  political and moral duty — to the victims  to ourselves and  most of all  to the generations to come.  Europe has become the unifying force of the region. My country’s absolute dedication to joining the EU is shared by all the countries of the western Balkans. If we choose  as democracies  to belong to something that is greater than the sum of its parts  the balkanization of the Balkans can be reversed.  Serbia’s European vision is complemented by our strong desire to continue restoring and deepening the many close friendships that Yugoslavia made across the globe during the post-Second World War period. It will be one of the key priorities in the years to come for my country and my Government. As a country that is the largest successor to a co-founder of the Non-Aligned Movement  Serbia will work hard to contribute to a more equitable global community  devoted to advancing the democratization of international relations  economic and social development  and human rights.  I close by saying that my country remains ready to further promote a nobler form of intergovernmental cooperation that truly addresses challenges  alleviates divisions  and reduces tensions. Such a vision can be built only on the firm foundation of the universal principles of sovereign equality  solidarity and international law within the framework of the United Nations. "
"190",7590,"ZAF",63,2008,"My delegation and I join in expressing our congratulations to you  Father Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann  on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session  and we hope you have a very successful and rewarding term at the helm of this body. We express our gratitude to His Excellency Mr. Srgjan Kerim for the excellent work done during his tenure as President of the Assembly at its sixty-second session.   Once again  we have come to this body to reaffirm the need for what we have always called for: the implementation of all the promises and pledges that we have made before. The focus of the sixty-third session of the General Assembly is on the global food crisis  climate change and reform of the United Nations. The confluence of the food  fuel and financial crises  as well as the effects of climate change  pose the real threat that they will undermine the progress made by developing countries in the struggle against poverty and underdevelopment.  During the Millennium Summit  held in 2000  our heads of State and Government adopted a Declaration (resolution 55/2) that communicated a message of hope and a vision of a better world. Included in the Declaration was an important section on the special needs of Africa. In paragraph 24 of the Declaration  the leaders stated that they would  “spare no effort to promote democracy and strengthen the rule of law  as well as respect for all internationally recognized human rights and fundamental freedoms  including the right to development”.   African and many other  developing countries have indeed taken responsibility for promoting democracy  good governance  peace and stability and human rights. They are also hard at work rolling back the frontiers of poverty and underdevelopment. But  despite those strides  it is clear that many in sub-Saharan Africa will not achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Part of the reason is that the global partnership for development on which the achievement of the MDGs was predicated has not been fully implemented. Despite the lofty ideas expressed at previous sessions of the Assembly  we continue to fall short in meeting our commitments to implement that partnership  in particular in the areas of trade  aid and debt relief.   We express the fervent hope that the high-level meetings organized by yourself  Mr. President  and the Secretary-General  on Africa’s development needs and on the MDGs  have served not only as important reminders of the challenges we face  but also as a catalyst that will cause the world to feel a greater sense of urgency.  The necessary resources exist in the world to achieve the MDGs. We need to summon the necessary political will and compassion. So we join the sister countries of our continent in calling for massive resource transfers through development assistance  investment  trade  technology transfers and human resource development. These will ensure that African and other developing countries are able to successfully adapt to the devastating impact of climate change and achieve the MDGs.  However  in order to accelerate the achievement of all the Millennium Development Goals  much more attention needs to be focused on Goal 3  regarding the empowerment of women. Women need to be at the centre of development as agents of change  socially  economically and politically.     08-53141 12   Billions of the people of the world  whom we are privileged to represent in the Assembly  have cast their eyes on this gathering of leaders. They have done so because they have hope that this leadership will take the required measures in order to address poverty and underdevelopment. We dare not fail them.  The food crisis has to be addressed in the short and medium terms. The Green Revolution that has been launched by the African Union needs partnerships in order to succeed. In addition  support for the New Partnership for Africa’s Development will be a major contributor to the struggle against poverty and underdevelopment. In that context  allow me  Mr. President  to quote from your own statement to the General Assembly with regard to that socio-economic programme as well as the role of our immediate former President  Thabo Mbeki:  “During his presidency of the rainbow nation  spanning nearly a decade  he  along [with] other African leaders  championed the vision of NEPAD we still pursue today. When the affluent listen to Africa and partner with it  that vision is within reach. To quote NEPAD’s founding document: `In fulfilling its promise  this agenda must give hope to the emaciated African child that the twenty-first century is indeed Africa’s century.’” (  p. 3)   The Doha Development Round has stalled despite seven years of negotiations. We are convinced that trade and increased market access will make a major contribution to the achievement of the MDGs. In that regard  it is our submission that the Doha Round of trade negotiations should not be allowed to die  but must remain focused on development  as originally envisaged.   In recent years  we have all witnessed the devastating effects of climate change  especially on island States. Hurricanes have become more frequent and more vicious  together with droughts  floods and unpredictable extreme weather patterns in the rest of the world. Of course  climate change requires an urgent response. Given the agreement in Bali last year on a road map for negotiations  it is our hope that the negotiations  to be completed in Copenhagen in 2009  will necessarily set the stage for more concerted action by all countries to address climate change and all its manifestations  with the developed countries taking the lead. South Africa commits itself to approaching the preparations for Copenhagen constructively and with a view to reaching an agreement that is ambitious  balanced and inclusive.  We join the many leaders of the world who have expressed their support for fundamental reform of the system of global governance  including the United Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions. It is important to understand that the critical issues facing the world today — the current financial  food and energy crises — cannot be addressed effectively when so many countries and regions of the world are left out of the key decision-making processes of important institutions of global governance. South Africa stands ready to work with other members of the United Nations to advance the goal of reform.   Equally  the reform of the Security Council need not be re-emphasized. We reiterate our view that a reformed Security Council would have more legitimacy and that its decisions would have more credibility. We welcome the recent decision (decision 62/557) to launch in the General Assembly inter-governmental negotiations on Security Council reform  to discuss plans for expanding the Security Council in both the non-permanent and permanent categories. It is of course a travesty of justice that Africa  which constitutes a large portion of the work of the Council  is not represented in the permanent category. Unless the ideals of freedom  justice and equality become the character of the United Nations  including the Security Council  the dominant will continue to dictate to the dominated  while the dreams of the dominated will forever be deferred.  In December this year  my country will complete its tenure as a non-permanent member of the Security Council. We have indeed been privileged to serve the peoples of Africa and the world in that capacity; it has been a historic first for us as a young democracy. In that capacity  we were indeed honoured to contribute meaningfully to global efforts to create peace and stability in all regions of the world. Accordingly  we express the humble gratitude of the people of our country to the general membership of the United Nations for the trust placed in us in helping the world discharge this mandate.  During our tenure  the Security Council also focused on the important question of enhancing the relationship between the United Nations and regional organizations  in particular the African Union (AU).   13 08-53141  We were honoured to be able to contribute to that work. We congratulate the Secretary-General on appointing an African Union-United Nations panel of distinguished persons whose mandate is to explore financing modalities for AU-led peacekeeping missions.  Peace continues to evade the Middle East. South Africa participated in the Annapolis Conference in 2007 with great expectations and hopes that progress would indeed be made to advance the goal of peace in that region. We will continue to support all international efforts to help the peoples of Palestine and Israel in their endeavour to find a lasting and peaceful solution to their challenges  leading to the establishment of a viable Palestinian State  coexisting side by side with the State of Israel  within secure borders. We understand full well the pain  suffering and agony that conflict brings to bear on the lives of ordinary people  particularly women and children. Those ordinary souls continue to cry out to this Assembly of the world  as they have done in the past  to help bring an end to the conflict.  South Africa will continue to work with the sister peoples of the Democratic Republic of the Congo  Burundi and Côte d’Ivoire in their efforts to consolidate peace and democracy in their respective countries. With regard to Zimbabwe  the Assembly must certainly be aware of the recent developments led by our former President Thabo Mbeki in his capacity as the Southern African Development Community (SADC) facilitator  which culminated in the signing of an agreement between the main political protagonists in the country. We hope that the leadership of Zimbabwe win soon finalize aspects of that agreement to make possible the formation of a new Government that will help lay the groundwork to address the political and economic challenges facing their country. SADC  the African Union and the facilitator stand as guarantors of the agreement. We call on the international community to spare neither strength nor effort in lending a hand to the people of Zimbabwe as they embark on the difficult path of reconciliation and reconstruction.  Equally  the situations in Somalia and the Sudan  and especially in Darfur  remain matters of great concern. South Africa will continue to do whatever it can  both bilaterally and in the context of the African Union and the United Nations  to help the peoples of Sudan and Somalia find peace among themselves.  We remain concerned about the impasse on the question of Western Sahara. South Africa is committed to seeking a just  mutually acceptable and lasting solution to that problem.   This year also marks the sixtieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. During the past six decades  the Declaration has remained the key standard for human rights  justice and dignity. We should therefore use this anniversary period to strengthen our resolve to defend human rights. South Africa has also had the honour to be reviewed under the Universal Periodic Review mechanism of the new Human Rights Council. We were also honoured with the appointment of our own Justice Navi Pillai to lead that very important international institution. Mr. Siles Alvarado (Bolivia)  Vice-President  took the Chair.  We wish to reiterate our belief in the centrality of the United Nations. In the Millennium Declaration  we reaffirmed that the United Nations “is the indispensable common house of the entire human family  through which we will seek to realize our universal aspirations for peace  cooperation and development” (resolution 55/2  para. 32). Leading South Africa’s delegation to the Millennium Summit was our former President  Thabo Mbeki  who reminded the Assembly that  “Billions among the living struggle to survive in conditions of poverty  deprivation and underdevelopment ... as offensive to everything humane as anything we decry about the second millennium.” (A/55/PV.5  p. 18)  It is that understanding that has correctly informed the engagement of successive leaders of our democratic State with this body over the years. In that regard  we are touched and humbled by the kind comments made in the Assembly by the various heads of State or Government and heads of delegation  directed at our immediate former President  Thabo Mbeki. We most certainly shall  through our Government  convey those sentiments to that noble son of our people and our continent  and citizen of the world.  Accordingly  from this rostrum may I also express our sincere gratitude to the general membership of the United Nations for the support that    08-53141 14  former President Mbeki and our country received over the past nine-and-a-half years of his stewardship of our country. As the leadership of our country is passed on  we confirm that South Africa  under the guidance of President Kgalema Motlanthe  shall indeed continue to be a trusted and dependable partner in the common endeavour to strengthen our institutions of multilateralism  starting from the correct premise that multilateralism remains the only hope in addressing the challenges facing humanity today  whether they be terrorism  threats to human rights  peace and stability or  of course  the central struggle against poverty and underdevelopment. "
"191",7632,"ZMB",63,2008,"At the outset  my delegation wishes to convey  on behalf of the people and the Government of the Republic of Zambia  our deepest and sincere appreciation and gratitude to Member States  as well as the United Nations  for the numerous messages of condolences we received following the loss of our beloved President  His Excellency Mr. Levy Patrick Mwanawasa  State Council  who passed away in Paris  France on 19 August 2008. Their messages of sympathy comforted and strengthened us immensely.   We are particularly indebted to the Government of Egypt for the medical attention rendered to our late President when he suffered a stroke while attending the African Union summit in Sharm el-Sheik on 29 June 2008 and for his subsequent evacuation to France. We are similarly grateful to the Government of France for the medical attention and hospitality availed to the late President up to the time of his death as well as for the repatriation of his body to Zambia for burial. The President was put to rest on 3 September 2008  which  incidentally  would have been his sixtieth birthday.   I wish to inform this Assembly that  in accordance with the Zambian Constitution  elections for the new President should be held within 90 days of the death or incapacitation of a sitting President. Thus  the Government has designated 30 October 2008 for the presidential by-election. In the spirit of transparency  accountability and good governance  the Zambian Government has invited international organizations  including the United Nations  to send election observers to the elections.  At this juncture  let me join others who have spoken before me in congratulating you  Mr. President  on your assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session. Zambia has no doubt that you will steer this session to a successful conclusion. I wish to assure you of Zambia’s support.  May I also take this opportunity to pay tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Srgjan Kerim of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia  for ably presiding over the proceedings of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session.  I wish to thank the Secretary-General for his tireless efforts in his dedicated service to humankind in trying to maintain international peace and security  achieve development and eradicate poverty for all.  The theme for this session  “The impact of the global food crisis on poverty and hunger in the world as well as the need to democratize the United Nations”  is indeed testimony to the noble efforts of the Secretary-General. The theme is also most appropriate  especially since it is relevant to the development challenges currently facing Africa and the developing world as a whole.  It is confirmed in the Secretary-General’s reports that many developing countries  and in particular sub-Saharan Africa  will not meet the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015 and that Member States should therefore redouble and reconfirm their commitments if we are to meet that target.  Zambia believes that the attainment of the MDGs will be meaningful only if it is all-inclusive. That will require the implementation of programmes and policies for empowering women  the girl child and other vulnerable groups of society be part of the overall process within that framework.   11 08-53129   In that regard  Zambia supports the assertion that women’s empowerment and gender equality are drivers for reducing poverty  building food security and reducing maternal mortality. It is in that realization that most of the States members of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) signed the SADC Protocol on Gender and Development in August 2008 — the first of its kind in Africa.  Such regional and national efforts need to be complemented by global action. It is in that regard that Zambia welcomes the ongoing debate on reforms in the context of United Nations system-wide coherence  particularly as they relate to strengthening the gender architecture  which is currently fragmented and underresourced.  In the process of empowering women and striving for gender equality  Zambia realizes that HIV/AIDS continues to be a challenge to the country’s development  with the prevalence rate for women being higher than that of men. The pandemic is robbing the country of a young and productive workforce. The Zambian Government therefore has put in place a number of policies that have helped to reduce the prevalence of HIV from 16 per cent in 2001 to 14 per cent in 2007. That reduction in the prevalence rate is an indication that our Government is determined to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS. That would not  however  be possible without the support of the international community.  The Monterrey Consensus places obligations on developed and developing countries alike to come up with concrete strategies and action to address poverty. Most African countries  including Zambia  have resolved to develop their economies and embarked on prudent macroeconomic management  channelling resources to growth sectors that present the greatest prospect for wealth and employment creation. They have further developed policies  plans and programmes that are not only growth-oriented but also pro-poor and address social development.  I wish to acknowledge with appreciation the role that our cooperating partners and the international community have played and continue to play in all our development and poverty-eradication programmes. We welcome the commitments made by Africa and its cooperating partners in the context of various important initiatives and partnerships in recent years  inter alia  the Tokyo International Conference on African Development  which among other things  came up with a Follow-up Mechanism with regard to implementation of commitments made during the conference.  Similarly  the China-Africa Partnership and the European Union-Africa Strategic Partnership have also contributed substantially to Africa’s development needs. With regard to the India-Africa Forum  we also look forward to the speedy implementation of commitments undertaken during the Summit Forum in India in April 2008.  Furthermore  we appreciate the assistance rendered by the G-8 Africa Partnership  the Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief of the President of the United States of America  the comprehensive health-care initiative sponsored by the Government of Cuba  the Initiative for Africa’s Development of the Republic of Korea and Pakistan’s Special Technical Assistance Programme for Africa. In similar vein  we look forward to the implementation of the recently launched Africa-Turkey partnership forum.  Zambia notes with concern  however  that the efforts the cooperating partners are making with regard to improved access to the markets of the developed countries and official development assistance flows and finance for development for African countries have not been completely fulfilled. We commend the five cooperating partners that have met or exceeded the target of 0.7 per cent of their gross national income as their contribution to official development assistance. We urge the cooperating partners that have not fulfilled their commitments to do so. We also look forward to the upcoming Follow-up International Conference on Financing for Development to Review the Implementation of the Monterrey Consensus in Doha and hope donors will honour their commitments.  We are aware that improved market access for developing countries is one commitment that  once fulfilled  will offer the greatest prospects for our integration into the world trading system. It also has the potential to foster food security for all and to raise the standard of living of the majority of the population that depends on agriculture for its livelihood.   In that regard  Zambia notes with disappointment that the Doha Round of trade negotiations collapsed at a time when many of us were looking forward to a successful conclusion to those protracted talks. It is my country’s hope that the negotiations will reconvene and    08-53129 12  conclude as soon as possible so that the developing countries can compete favourably and become integrated into the multilateral trading system.  The current global oil and food crises not only pose a threat to the gains made in achieving macroeconomic stability and growth in developing countries  but are an even greater threat to the achievements made towards eliminating extreme poverty and reducing by half the proportion of people suffering from hunger.  A solution to the food crisis must be found as a matter of urgency. In that connection  Zambia wishes to thank the Secretary-General for establishing the High-Level Task Force on the Global Food Security Crisis  whose task is to find a coherent and coordinated approach to resolving the food crisis. In addressing the crisis  we must be mindful of the fact that a large percentage of the people in developing countries depend on agriculture for their livelihoods. Therefore  in finding a solution to high food prices  we should ensure that we do not inadvertently encourage rural-urban migration by including measures that are disadvantageous to those engaged in food and general agricultural production.  In addition  the issue of climate change  which has worsened the food crisis  requires the concerted efforts of the international community to address it through the development of adaptation and mitigation measures. Zambia  like most of sub-Saharan Africa  has not been spared the adverse effects of climate change  such as increased exposure to drought  rising temperatures  more erratic rainfall and extreme weather conditions. Those are threatening water and agricultural systems  thereby condemning millions more to face malnutrition and water shortages.  Mr. Tanin (Afghanistan)  Vice-President  took the Chair.  Let me now turn to the ongoing reforms of the United Nations  in particular the protracted discussions on reform of the Security Council. Zambia wishes to reiterate the fact that United Nations reform will not be complete without meaningful reform of the Security Council. Any new proposals to reform the Council should take into account Africa’s call for two permanent seats with the veto power and two additional non-permanent seats  as that will not only address the historical injustice against Africa  but also respond to the need to democratize the Security Council  given that Africa constitutes the second-largest bloc of the United Nations membership. Equally important in that regard will be the need to reform the working methods of that important United Nations body.  It is a matter of concern to Zambia that the question of Western Sahara has remained unresolved for such a long time. In accordance with the principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter and General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960  the people of Western Sahara should be free to exercise their inalienable right to self-determination. In that regard  Zambia calls for the implementation of all relevant United Nations resolutions on that matter  while supporting the ongoing efforts between the parties concerned to find a lasting solution.  With regard to the situation in Zimbabwe  Zambia welcomes the signing of the Inter-Party Agreement on 15 September 2008 and pays tribute to former South African President Thabo Mbeki  who  on behalf of SADC  successfully discharged the mandate entrusted to him. We remain optimistic that the concerned parties will adhere to the Agreement  which has created a good basis for addressing the socio-economic problems confronting the country. In that regard  we appeal to the international community to provide all possible support to the people of Zimbabwe in their efforts to resuscitate their economy.  There is no doubt that the United Nations remains the only multilateral institution capable of addressing the challenges of our one world. The world’s poor are looking to the United Nations system to deliver on its commitments to enable them to live in dignity with every possible opportunity  free from hunger and diseases such as HIV/AIDS and  above all  in a peaceful  secure and environmentally sustainable world. Let us therefore not fail them  for they deserve no less. "
"192",7668,"ZWE",63,2008,"I wish to begin by joining those who have congratulated Mr. d’Escoto Brockmann on his election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-third session. My delegation is confident that  under his able stewardship  the General Assembly will make progress on many issues scheduled for discussion during the current session. I would also like to pay special tribute to his predecessor  Mr. Kerim  who successfully presided over the General Assembly at its sixty-second session.   The focus of our discussions at the present session  namely  the impact of the global food crisis on poverty and hunger in the world  as well as the need to democratize the United Nations  relates well to our Millennium Development Goals. For us in the developing world  the eradication of poverty is the first   11 08-51851  of our priorities and should indeed continue to receive serious attention.  The current global food crisis  characterized by escalating food prices  is causing untold suffering for the majority of poor people in many developing countries. That has been compounded by the energy crisis  with devastating social and economic consequences  especially for the most vulnerable in society such as women  children  the elderly and people living with HIV and AIDS. The crisis now qualifies as a humanitarian emergency that requires global solidarity to provide post-haste assistance in the form of food  water and energy.  For most developing countries  the crisis is competing with other pressing demands for scarce resources for development  including achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  especially as we are faced with declining official development assistance and foreign direct investment. The trend will  regrettably  reverse some of the progress made towards the attainment of the MDGs. It is therefore crucial that national efforts aimed at addressing the global food and energy crises be complemented by appropriate international assistance and interventions  including debt cancellation for low-income  food-deficient developing countries so as to release more resources to fight hunger.   Adequate support for food production programmes is absolutely necessary. We call for more research into better seed varieties and assistance in irrigation technology and improved water harvesting methods  necessary to mitigate the effects of climate change on agriculture. Zimbabwe believes that the challenges of climate change should be addressed in the context of development programmes that recognize the three pillars of economic and social thrusts  as well as environmental protection.  In the past year  Zimbabwe is proud to have played its modest part in promoting sustainable development through its chairmanship of the sixteenth session of the United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development. The session examined the obstacles and barriers to development in the areas of agriculture  land use and rural development  and to drought-mitigation measures and desertification prevention in Africa. My Government  which was an active participant at the High-Level Conference on World Food Security  held under the auspices of the Food and Agriculture Organization in Rome in June this year  will continue to play its active role in formulating policy recommendations on the subject of sustainable development targets.  We share the view that trade is an important tool for development  and so we reiterate our call for an open  rule-based  predictable and non-discriminatory trading and financial system that seeks the removal of the main trade barriers. Tariffs have unfortunately remained high on goods from developing economies  such as textiles and farm products. It is therefore disturbing that the Doha Round negotiations have collapsed without any indication of when they will be reconvened.  The objectives of the Charter of the United Nations in the economic arena will remain unfulfilled unless all Member States genuinely and seriously participate in efforts to redress challenges that persist in developing countries. Social justice  political stability and sustainable development in most developing countries can best be achieved through genuine and committed support for empowerment programmes through  inter alia  just land ownership patterns. We understand only too well in our context that sustainable development is not possible without agrarian reform.   My Government has therefore gone a long way towards laying the foundation for sustainable food production through its land reform programme. The majority of our rural people have been empowered to contribute to household and national food security and  indeed  to be masters of their own destiny. However  the effects of climate change  which have included recurrent droughts and floods in the past seven years  and the illegal  unilaterally imposed sanctions on my country have hindered Zimbabwe’s efforts to increase food production. Once again  I appeal to the world’s collective conscience to apply pressure for the immediate removal of those sanctions by Britain  the United States and their allies  which have brought untold suffering to my people.  Zimbabwe has always been and continues to be a firm believer in multilateral approaches to solving disputes  as opposed to the unilateralism favoured by some countries. Our experience has shown that the cooperative and pacific approach often leads to lasting solutions to conflicts. We therefore deplore the vindictive approach  which is often characterized by    08-51851 12  self-righteous finger-pointing  double standards and the imposition of unilateral sanctions  to coerce smaller and weaker countries to bow to the wishes of militarily stronger States.  In addition  the unilateral and coercive economic measures that we have witnessed in recent years are again completely at cross purposes with the principles that guide international cooperation  as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.  Not long ago  some permanent members of the Security Council sought to invoke Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations so that its weight of sanctions and other measures could be applied against my small country  which  by any stretch of the imagination  is no threat to international peace and security. What insanity is this that has afflicted some world leaders? Should that sacred document  the Charter of the United Nations  be allowed to suffer such undeserved emasculation and disgraceful abuse? And where is the protection of small and innocent countries like mine from threatened and real acts of aggression and punitive acts  often based on completely false allegations of violations of the rule of law  democracy or human rights? By the way  those who falsely accuse us of those violations are themselves international perpetrators of genocide and mass destruction.  The innocent masses of men  women and children who have perished in their thousands in Iraq surely demand retribution and vengeance. Who shall heed their cry? Surely those who invaded Iraq under false pretences and on the strength of contrived lies and in complete violation of the Charter of the United Nations and international law must be made liable for them. They must be made to answer for their acts of aggression.  Zimbabwe derives solace from the fact that there are some permanent members of the Security Council that have taken principled stands in defending the Charter and protecting our sovereignty by ensuring that the Council acts not only within its mandate  but also impartially  objectively and justly. Indeed  their sense of justice ensured that Zimbabwe — a country that poses no threat to regional or international peace — did not fall prey to the cocktail of lies and machinations that had been designed by our detractors to encourage United Nations sanctions against us under Chapter VII. We thank them for upholding truth and objectivity.   While we recognize the important role of the good offices of the Secretary-General in helping Member States to resolve political and other problems  we are of the view that international civil servants should discharge their noble duties with sensitivity and neutrality. At no time should they seek to pander to the whims and caprices of the mighty against the weak. Similarly  we call on certain Security Council members to desist from abusing the Secretariat in an attempt to promote their political interests. It is our firm belief that the Secretary-General and his staff should be allowed to serve all Member States without fear or favour.  We reiterate our long-held view that the Security Council as presently constituted is undemocratic. Its present configuration renders it subject to manipulation by the powerful countries that use the Council as a readily available legitimizing forum for their political machinations. Thus  it is imperative that the Security Council be democratized by ensuring equitable geographical representation through an increase in its membership. Zimbabwe remains steadfast in its support for the Ezulwini Consensus  which calls for Africa to have two permanent seats with the same powers and prerogatives as the current permanent members  as well as two non-permanent seats.  We share the view that the General Assembly  a body that represents all of us and enjoys a wider representation of States  must continue to be the supreme decision-making body of the United Nations. We call for its revitalization to make it more effective and to enable it to fully carry out its Charter mandate. It is our fervent hope that a revitalized General Assembly will reassert its prestige  its pre-eminent role  its authority and its capacity to guide and direct other organs of the United Nations system. In that context  the tendency of some members of the Security Council to usurp the power and mandates of the General Assembly must be resisted.  I am pleased to report that the inter-party talks in Zimbabwe — for which our regional grouping  the Southern African Development Community (SADC)  appointed a facilitator — ended with the signing of an agreement on the formation of an all-inclusive Government on 15 September. That was achieved entirely through African mediation  which is clear testimony that Africa is capable of overcoming its own challenges and problems  which  by the way  are often the remnants of colonialism. African leaders  working   13 08-51851  together  were able to find an African solution to an African problem. In that regard  I wish to pay special tribute to President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa  whose patience  fortitude  sensitivity  diplomatic skills and painstaking work made it possible for the Zimbabwean parties to overcome what had appeared to be insurmountable and intractable difficulties in reaching an agreement.  I would like to extend my thanks to SADC  the African Union and individual African and other leaders who lent their support to that initiative. My party  the Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front  will abide by the spirit and letter of the agreement to which we have appended our signature. As the Government  we are prepared to cooperate with all other countries that respect Zimbabwe’s sovereignty. I would therefore like to appeal to those members of the international community that have imposed illegal sanctions against Zimbabwe to lift them so that my country can focus undisturbed on its economic turnaround programme.  In conclusion  we hope that we will continue to shape an Organization that upholds universal values and interests  attends to the urgent needs of those in need and remains in the service of humanity. Long live the United Nations!  "
