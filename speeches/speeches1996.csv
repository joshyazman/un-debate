"1",26,"AFG",51,1996,"﻿At the outset  allowme  Sir  to express my delegation’s congratulations uponyour election to the high position of President of theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-first session.The Afghan trauma  which was imposed by othersand endured by the Afghan people  continues to havedisturbing consequences for our nation. For the world  itmay be just another trouble spot. But for Afghans  itmeans agony  pain  loss  psychological trauma and anunknown future. We must not forget that there is stillhope. It lies in the international connection between meand other representatives and  through them  to theircountrymen. The United Nations was built on that dreamand today  that connection is once again being made —it is the fifty-first connection.Two tragic dates will stand out in the recent historyof Afghanistan: 27 December 1979 and 27 September1996. Both were black days that trigger bitter memoriesin the minds of all patriotic Afghans. The first datereminds them of the occupation by the former SovietUnion and the second  of another occupying force  backedby another neighbour.The force occupying parts of our homeland today isknown as the Taliban — a name that became veryfamiliar to the General Assembly at the previous session.3What was the Taliban’s first act when it captured Kabul? Itwas to attack not a military garrison  but the United Nationsoffice in Afghanistan. Its first act was to breach the sanctityof the United Nations compound  in violation of allaccepted international norms and laws.That is the Taliban. As European Commissioner Emma Bonino  said yesterday  the Taliban is a force thatthreatens to take Afghanistan back to the dark ages.Numerous international media reports from Kabul draw apicture of an organization supported from abroad  imposinga draconian system on a terrified people. The Taliban haveordered schools and universities to close and stopped alleducation and employment for women. There are numerousreports from the media  the United States authorities andthe United Nations on the role of the Taliban in a $75billion heroin export industry in Afghanistan.On 1 October 1996  The New York Times said that the1 million people who live in Kabul alone had been plungedinto the“labyrinth that is Taliban rule”.On 3 October 1996 the Reuters news agency said that while the Taliban has tried to seek international recognition it has been greeted with “suspicion — and fear”. In justtheir first week in Kabul  the Taliban earned thecondemnation of Amnesty International.These are not the words of the Afghan Governmentdescribing the Taliban occupation — these are the words ofAmnesty International:“Despite statements from their leadershipsuggesting moderation  it is clear that Taleban guardsare busily implementing a reign of terror in Kabul ...Families are afraid to go out into the streets  afraid toanswer their doors  and afraid that their loved oneswill suffer the brutal consequence”of Taliban rule. Amnesty International accuses the Talibanof seizing  in house-to-house searches in the capital  up to1 000 prisoners  who were forced to walk over the front-line minefields.French television showed the Taliban storming into theKabul museum  where they destroyed many artifacts  relicsand statues that were unique. Those artifacts and statuesbelonged to the Buddhist era and are irreplaceable.I am talking about the Taliban  which isoverwhelmed by foreign-fomented hatred  mandated by aforeign-crafted agenda and committed to the annihilationof the political  social and economic fabric ofAfghanistan. It is an organization whose display of terrorin Kabul breaks all records. In short  the Taliban aremercenaries — an illegal and illegitimate force that hasbeen imposed on the Afghan people.Once again  foreign interference is the main cause ofthe continued conflict in Afghanistan. The current state ofterror and chaos  touching the lives of every living soulin Kabul  is the direct consequence of that interference.We have at our disposal hard evidence that we willsubmit in due course to the Security Council forappropriate consideration. What could prove that there isforeign interference better than the foreign militias  whichinclude some officers  who were recently captured on thebattlefield by the armed forces of the Islamic State ofAfghanistan?The Islamic State of Afghanistan firmly believes thatthe so-called Taliban is a perfect example of a mercenaryforce as defined by the International Convention againstthe Recruitment  Use  Financing and Training ofMercenaries  adopted by the General Assembly in 1989.We are not denying the existence among the Taliban ofAfghan youths who were raised across the border andattended religious schools there  but it cannot be statedtoo clearly that the main corps of the Taliban militarystaff consists of officers and militia forces from beyondour borders  paid by military-industrial magnates trying tooverthrow the Islamic State of Afghanistan.The United Nations General Assembly  on 21December 1995  adopted a resolution which condemnedany State that permits or tolerates the recruitment financing  training  assembly  transit and use ofmercenaries with the objective of overthrowing theGovernment of any State Member of the United Nations especially that of a developing country.The Charter of the United Nations  in variousArticles  urges all Members to develop friendly relationsamong themselves and to refrain in their internationalrelations from the threat or use of force against theterritorial integrity or political independence of any State.On the occasion of the commemoration of thetwenty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations on 24October 1970  the General Assembly approved the4Declaration on Principles of International Law concerningFriendly Relations and Cooperation among States. The firstprinciple declares that States shall refrain in theirinternational relations from the threat or use of forceagainst the territorial integrity or political independence ofany State  or in any other manner inconsistent with thepurposes of the United Nations.The Seventh Islamic Summit Conference inCasablanca on 13 December 1994  the Conference of Headsof State and Government of the Non-Aligned Countries on18 October of 1995 in Cartagena de Indias  the GeneralAssembly resolution on Afghanistan of 19 December 1995and the Twenty-third Islamic Conference of ForeignMinsters on 9 December 1995 held in Conakry  Guinea  allinsist vigorously on the principle of non-intervention andrespect for the territorial integrity and independence ofAfghanistan and on a peace process based on genuine intra-Afghan dialogue.It is a matter of great disappointment that persistentappeals to the United Nations made by the Islamic State ofAfghanistan to send a fact-finding mission to inquire intoand investigate the level  degree and nature of foreignintervention in Afghanistan remain unanswered.Last year  we presented facts about the Taliban fromthis rostrum. Our plight went unheard. We are afraid  giventhe accounts of documented facts by the press and our clearstand on the legacy of the Taliban  that our plight might gounheard once more. That will be even more catastrophicthan the Taliban take-over itself.The latest reports  as recent as yesterday  reveal someshocking realities and facts about the Taliban attacks on theareas surrounding Kabul  the capital. Allow me to unveilthe screened and concealed crime that the Taliban  assistedby their outside sponsors  committed very recently. Exactly26 days ago  on 11 September 1996  intelligence sources ofthe Defence Ministry of the Islamic State of Afghanistanintercepted and recorded a Taliban radio transmissionbetween Nangarhar and Kandahar. That transmission saysthe following:“Give regards to the victorious Mullah Shukrullah ...Tell him that new APR weapons have already beenbrought to Kandahar. You should immediately sendthese arms  which are gas weapons  through Torkhantowards Nangarhar because we have organized agroup of Taliban with special gear and are waiting forthe said weapons. We can capture large areas witha single round.”On 17 September  just six days later  I personallytook this report  submitted to me by the Ministry ofDefence  and presented it to the State Supreme Council convened under the leadership of Mr. Rabbani  thePresident of Afghanistan  in Blandage bunker  just northof Kabul  the capital. I still remember an overwhelmingstillness occupied the room after I submitted the report.After a brief calmness  a member of the Councilremarked that maybe the report had been passed aroundto demoralize State troops; hence  not enough attentionwas paid to the issue.Yesterday  we obtained a shocking — and I repeat shocking — report from the headquarters of theGovernment in Taloqan  which reminded me of theSupreme Council meeting. Officials of the Islamic Stateof Afghanistan recorded radio conversations by theTaliban in the front line around evening on 26 September the night before the Taliban take-over of Kabul. Thefollowing assurances were reported:“Reassure the leaders that the new weapons havehad good results in Lata Band  Bande-Ghazi andPuli-Charkhi.”These areas  for the information of therepresentatives  are located to the east of Kabul  thecapital.More staggering realities are provided by theeyewitness reports of those who saw the areas afterwards.These eyewitnesses have reported that they saw most ofthe corpses of the Government troops laying on theground without any sign of injury from a bullet or arsenalpenetration in their bodies. However  they did reveal thatthey had noticed that the Government troops had bledfrom their noses  eyes and ears. Mr. Muslim  a veterancommander of the Government  who witnessed similarsituations during the Soviet occupation  has remarked that:“The Taliban advance in the front line completelysurprised me. I then realized that the Taliban mustbe in possession of some kind of weapons moreadvanced than we had seen  possessed or known.”Mr. Muslim  the commander  continues:5“Chemical weapons hadn’t crossed my mind untilthe evening of 26 September during the Taliban’sfierce attack on Lata Band. I received a radiotransmission that a large number of our men werebeing lost and even when I commanded the rest toretreat  I heard no reply. I contacted my headquarters.I was ordered to examine the front line. One hour hadpassed since my initial contact with the front linewhen I arrived there. Then I saw Commander Saboor lying dead on the battle ground. I only noticed bloodaround his nose and ears. Saboor was a close friend ofmine. Suddenly  I had a flashback of the Red Armyusing similar weapons during the jihad. I reallywanted to take his body  which had no trace ofexternal injury  back with me. But the intensity offighting did not give me the chance.”Based on this account  it is the strong conviction ofthe Islamic State of Afghanistan that the foreign sponsorsof the Taliban have provided them with some type ofinternationally banned gas or chemical weapon which wereused in the Taliban onslaught for the capture of Kabul  thecapital  where they encountered strong resistance.We are bringing this tragic episode to the attention ofthis Assembly and therefore appeal to the internationalcommunity immediately to assign a team of inquiry toinvestigate the case to which I have referred.The Islamic State of Afghanistan has continuouslyprovided information to the United Nations Special Missionand to the Security Council about the military acts of theTaliban  which have systematically refused to accept theUnited Nations peace process.In a letter to the Secretary-General of the UnitedNations dated 5 September 1995 (S/1995/767)  theGovernment of Afghanistan warned the internationalcommunity about the dangers of the fragmentation anddisintegration of Afghanistan and of the possibility of theTaliban military advances getting out of control.In the letter to the Secretary-General dated 14September 1995  the Islamic State of Afghanistanforecasted“the outcome of this new tension as alarming andperilous”and earnestly called for the prompt dispatching“of a fact-finding mission to western Afghanistan inorder to report during the consultations to theSecurity Council”. (S/1995/795  p. 2)The Secretary-General  in a letter dated 22September 1995  assured that “The United Nations remains committed to thesovereignty and territorial integrity of Afghanistanand opposed to all external interference in yourcountry. I am using the mandates entrusted to me bythe Member States to do all I can to resolve thesources of conflict which contribute to instability inAfghanistan. I shall continue to pursue acomprehensive approach to the overall peaceprocess  in which the Special Mission will continueto play the main United Nations role. I ask that youcontinue to cooperate with it.”In a letter dated 27 September 1995 to the Secretary-General  the Islamic State of Afghanistan stated that “Taliban not only undermined peace andtranquillity in the western parts of the country  butin the meantime  posed an external practical menaceto the territorial integrity of Afghanistan.”(S/1995/823  annex  p. 3)and that “the most reasonable and practical way to peace  andappropriate atmosphere for a peaceful transfer ofpower to an elected authority enjoying theconfidence of the people  is first and foremost theneed to ease off the present crisis of confidence'”.(ibid.)In the general debate of 4 October 1995  we declaredthat attempts by“reactionary groups to destabilize a moderate Islamicsystem which believes in democracy and humanrights  are wrong in their assessments andcalculations. Such foreign circles may think thatafter the usurpation of power by the Taliban all willgo well for them. In fact  they will add a furtherproblem  especially by bringing onto the scene afaction which has no factual presence onAfghanistan’s political scene. These circles shouldbe aware that the peace and security in the capital the actual relative peace and stability in the country6and in the region  would be jeopardized by such anerroneous miscalculation. The same error was madeby the former Soviet Union in 1979.” (OfficialRecords of the General Assembly  Fiftieth Session Plenary Meetings  19th meeting  p. 10)As far as the activities of the United Nations SpecialMission are concerned  we suggested  in a letter dated 30September 1995  that the efforts of the Secretary-General“and those of Ambassador Mahmoud Mestiri  Head ofthe United Nations Special Mission to Afghanistan would benefit from the establishment of a contactgroup on Afghanistan composed of States  but not theones immediately involved  as well as of interestedorganizations.” (A/50/510  annex  p. 2)In a letter dated 12 October 1995  we warned that “The different leaders of the Taliban have severaltimes declared their rejection of the United NationsSpecial Mission’s action in proposing to them toaccept a ceasefire. They have also rejected theproposals for peace talks with other parties to theconflict.” (S/1995/866  annex  p. 2)In a letter dated 12 November 1995  we informed theSecretary-General that “On 11 November 1995  the Taliban launched asmany as 170 rockets on the civilian-populated sectorsof Kabul  as a result of which 37 innocent lives werelost and more than 52 civilians wounded  whileimmense damage was inflicted upon public property.”(A/50/748  annex  p. 2)This is why in a letter dated 16 November 1995(A/50/760) addressed to the Secretary General  the IslamicState of Afghanistan inquired about the identity of theTaliban  their ideology and goals  their rejection of thepeace process and their negative attitude towards the UnitedNations.As a result of the heavy bombardment of the capitalby the Taliban on 26 November 1995  the Secretary-General expressed his concern about the escalation offighting and called upon all parties to cooperate with theefforts of the United Nations Special Mission  then headedby Ambassador Mahmoud Mestiri  aimed at achieving animmediate ceasefire and promoting negotiations among theparties on a transitional mechanism for the transfer ofpower  to achieve a just and durable settlement acceptableto all Afghans.During 1996 Afghanistan continued to keep theUnited Nations well informed about the atrocitiescommitted by the Taliban in a letter dated 19 January1996 (S/1996/44).On 9 April 1996 the Security Council held twomeetings on Afghanistan. During the meetings thedelegation of the Islamic State of Afghanistan providedadequate information on the role of the so-called Talibanin causing turmoil in Afghanistan and threatening thepeace and stability of the region. This was recognized bythe Security Council in a statement to the press on 13December 1995.In a letter dated 22 August 1996 addressed to theSecretary General  the President of the Security Councilstated that the members of Security Council “express their strong view that the warring partiesshould renounce the use of force and settle theirdifferences by peaceful means  through negotiations.“The members of the Security Council areconvinced that the main responsibility for finding apolitical solution to the conflict lies with the partiesand that all States must refrain from interference.”(S/1996/683  first and second paragraphs)The Taliban have consistently taken a rejectionistattitude and still act against the letter and the spirit of allSecurity Council and General Assembly resolutions anddecisions.Given this account  I must say that this is the timeto look back and see who is responsible for the ongoinghuman tragedy in Afghanistan. Was it not the lack of anyappropriate response by this Organization to theintransigent attitude of the Taliban that encouraged andenabled them to see the tunnel wide open and to pursuetheir designs crafted by military-industrial magnates fromabroad?The Islamic State of Afghanistan had continuouslywarned the United Nations about the possible outcome.Who is to blame  and could we consider it a conspiracyof indifference or a conspiracy of victimization?Regardless of which one it may be  the blood of Afghanshas been spilled. One thing manifested by the indifference7thus far is that Afghan blood is not cheap; rather  it isworthless.Let us go back to the drastic events that took placeduring the last couple of weeks. The Government forcesevacuated the capital in order to prevent a bloodbath. TheTaliban invaded Kabul on the morning of 27 September1996. The Government authorities relocated theirheadquarters and offices in Taloqan  the capital of thenorthern province of Takhar.Resistance against the Taliban is not limited only tothe Panjshir Valley  where the Taliban are conductingwidespread and extensive battles  targeting civilian areas. Inmany other parts of Afghanistan  under the rule of theTaliban  there exists the potential for resistance. Soon wewill hear about uprisings.In today’s circumstances  the objectives of the IslamicState of Afghanistan have not changed  and I would like toemphasize once again our firm commitment to GeneralAssembly resolution 50/88 on Afghanistan  which wasadopted by consensus on 19 December 1995.The provisional setback of one party in the conflictand the territorial gain of one side could not mean thatpeace would prevail in the country. Military occupationcannot bring about conflict resolution. On the contrary  theescalation of tension once again necessitates a negotiatedsettlement of the conflict through the mechanismformulated in operative paragraph 4 of resolution 50/88 Bof 19 December 1995. This provides a solution to the crisisin Afghanistan through the United Nations peace process.A ranking United Nations official expressed hisconcern by stating in The Los Angeles Times of 5 October1996 “It’s frightening [that] this is going to be theGovernment  because these men have obviously hadno experience but fighting.”The Taliban  who have invaded the capital city ofKabul with cross-border military assistance  will not be ableto ensure the national unity of Afghanistan  especially inthe light of what they have done during the first days oftheir military rule in the capital. The Taliban  in spite ofbeing Pashtuns  neither agree with the majority of Pashtunsof the country nor with Tajiks  Uzbeks  Hazaras  Turkmen Baluchis  Nooristanis and others.The Afghan leaders  intellectuals and scholars cannotagree with the regressive and backward views of theTaliban. Many religious leaders of the country do notapprove of their attitude and deem it incompatible withthe needs of Muslims in the modern world. They allconsider them unacceptable tools of foreign intervention.The military rule of the Taliban must not beconsidered final or accomplished. Those foreign quarterswhich have provided financial and military assistance tothe Taliban will not be able to subsidize and finance theirrule permanently.The Taliban are lacking any vision or ability for theobjective of economic and social rehabilitation inAfghanistan. They lack any coherent and systematicthinking or projection of the vast needs of today’sAfghanistan. Many of their leaders consider the teachingsof modern science and technology contrary to religion.They consider science to be sacrilege. The Taliban  whostill believe the earth is flat  are not the people forAfghanistan  not when we are about to enter the twenty-first century.Yet the outside sponsors of the Taliban areattempting to cover up their actual identity and nature thus soliciting a kind of legitimacy for this illegitimate obscurantist and terrorist group. Any relation establishedwith the Taliban may be interpreted by the Taliban astolerance by the international community. Allowing thisto happen would be an affront to the principles of theUnited Nations  a seal of approval for terrorism  alegitimization of foreign intervention and  indeed  aninsult to the human conscience.In the name of the Islamic State of Afghanistan andthe victimized Afghan nation  I express gratitude to allthose countries that have expressed their concern anddisapproval of the occupation of the Afghan capital Kabul  by the Taliban  and the rule of terror in that city.Days after the occupation of Kabul  on 2 October1996  the Coordination Meeting of Foreign Ministers ofthe member States of the Organization of the IslamicConference (OIC)  at which I had the honour to speak convened at the United Nations in New York. In a finalcommuniqué  they expressed“the hope that the Afghan parties will peacefullyresolve their political differences and collectively8work for the restoration of peace and stability in thecountry”.The practical solution to the Afghan problem needs toinclude the following elements  in conformity with GeneralAssembly resolution 50/88 B of 19 December 1995 on thequestion of Afghanistan: first  an immediate cessation ofarmed conflict and the declaration of a ceasefire; secondly an invitation to all Afghan parties to the negotiating table under the auspices of the United Nations and with thecooperation of the OIC; thirdly  an agreement on thecomposition and establishment of a transitional Governmentof national unity and the creation of a credible  authoritativebody to which power would immediately be transferred;and  fourthly  the consolidation of the political process inorder to ascertain the views of the people and solve theproblem through elections or through the convening of thetraditional Grand Assembly.Our basic views and main objectives are as follows:the re-establishment of peace and stability  along with thecreation of conditions conducive to ensuring that thepeoples of Afghanistan can live  in an atmosphere of lawand order  on the basis of democratic values and respect forhuman rights  as required by an authentic and truthfulvision of high Islamic principles; and the establishment ofa strong central Government on the basis of agreementamong all Afghan sides that have the capacity to mobilizemasses and are able to secure the achievement of thesegoals. This will allow Afghanistan to become once again apositive factor for peace and stability in the region to whichit belongs.Only a transitional Government of national unitywould be able to secure the national unity of the countryand to allow the launching of the major task ofreconstructing and rehabilitating Afghanistan. Such a goalcould not be achieved without the full participation of theintellectuals  scientists  experts and technocrats ofAfghanistan  many of whom now live abroad. We areexpecting all countries that are in favour of peace andstability in Afghanistan to assist our people in order toachieve these noble objectives.Upon adopting the Charter of the United Nations 51years ago in the city of San Francisco  the founding fathersof this global establishment declared the United Nations tobe based on the sovereign equality of all States. They didthis at a time when this principle was an ideal. The strugglefor freedom by many nations  together with millions ofsacrifices  on the one hand  and the need in the twentiethcentury for natural interdependence between the membersof this global family  on the other  proved more than everthe righteousness of this principle.It is apropos in this connection to quote HisExcellency Mr. Hervé de Charette  the Foreign Ministerof France  who on 25 September stated from this rostrum:“If we are not careful  we are going to be living ina world without criteria  without values  withoutreferences  in which some — the strongest andrichest — will be in a position to decide alone onthe future of the planet.” (Official Records of theGeneral Assembly  Fifty-first Session  PlenaryMeetings  8th meeting  p. 18)"
"2",65,"AGO",51,1996,"﻿Allow me at theoutset to congratulate Mr. Ismail Razali on his election asPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-first session which is being held at a particularly difficult juncture. I am however  persuaded that his personal attributes as well ashis proven diplomatic experience will ensure the successthat is expected from this Assembly.Allow me to express to His ExcellencyMr. Freitas do Amaral my congratulations on theoutstanding commitment he demonstrated during his termin office. Our best wishes for the future go to him as heresumes his work as an educator and conducts research forpeace and progress for all peoples.Allow me also to express my warm appreciation to theSecretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for the dynamic and visionary manner in which heconducted the business of our Organization during a timeof great change in the international arena. At this time theUnited Nations is more and more frequently called upon torise to new challenges and is compelled to face tests thatare not always peaceful. For this difficult mission theRepublic of Angola will continue to render its modestcontribution for the successful accomplishment of hismandate.At the threshold of the new century of the thirdmillennium we are increasingly faced with new andgreater challenges  the solutions to which require joint andconcerted actions by all States  irrespective of their size economic potential or military might. In this context countries that have Portuguese as an official language —Angola  Brazil  Cape Verde  Mozambique  Portugal andSao Tome and Principe — have recently decided toestablish a community of Portuguese-speaking countriesin order better to serve the interests of their peoples. Wewould like to thank the Government and people ofPortugal for fostering a cordial climate for thiscommunity of Portuguese-speaking countries.It is essential  therefore  that a broad and in-depthreform programme be adopted for multilateral institutions which would make a decisive contribution towards thedemocratization of international relations on the basis ofthe primacy of law  the safeguarding of the sovereignequality of States and reciprocity in the comity of nations.It is along these lines that we approach with allseriousness the restructuring of the United Nations and itssystem.Our goal is to optimize the functioning of bodiesthat coordinate the work of maintaining internationalpeace and security and fostering social and economicdevelopment. Although innumerable internationalconferences held by the United Nations in recent yearsvalidate this concern  a great deal remains to beaccomplished. We must go from words of intention todeeds.In this context  we believe that the current session ofthe General Assembly must approach with daring andpolitical resolve all current issues of common concern including those in the areas of international peacekeepingand security and the healing of the economic and socialcrisis that afflicts the developing world.Last year our Organization celebrated its fiftiethanniversary  and there was unanimous recognition by allmankind of its role as the most important forum forconcerted action among nations. Although therestructuring of the United Nations has always been an19issue of concern  it is now even more essential if we are torise to the challenges of the twenty-first century.In this connection  I would like to avail myself of thisopportunity first of all to congratulate the Open-endedHigh-level Working Group on the Strengthening of theUnited Nations System for the positive achievements wehave witnessed. Nevertheless  there is still a long roadahead before we achieve our final objectives and make itpossible for our Organization to play its true role. As amatter of fact  we are quite concerned by the currentfinancial crisis  which is affecting the proper operation ofour Organization and even threatening its very survival. Inthis context  we support proposals that suggest practicalaction for the correction of the financial situation  such asthe revision of the scale of assessments  the downsizing ofthe Secretariat and some of its bodies  with a view towardsrendering them more efficient  less bureaucratic and lessburdensome.By way of example  allow me to point out that severaldevelopmental assistance projects or humanitarian aidprogrammes are entrusted to foreign officials while theycould perfectly well be carried out by local officials withsimilar qualifications  which could cut down theimplementation costs to less than one third. This is onlyone example among the many we could cite that could gofar towards assisting with the financial healing of theOrganization.The measures we have alluded to are feasible andcould bring about greater benefits and substantially improvethe functioning of the Organization and its specializedagencies.As regards the Security Council  my Government hasalways supported its restructuring in order to strengthen itsrole and effectiveness and ensure greater transparency inthe decision-making process and in the implementation ofits resolutions. Our position therefore is identical to the oneadopted by the Organization of African Unity. It wouldexpand the Security Council and provide for fair and equalrepresentation by permanent and non-permanent members with equal rights and duties. Africa’s claim to at least twopermanent seats on the Security Council is nothing but itsproper and due right. We likewise support the right of otherregions to representation on the Council  with the status ofpermanent members.Regarding the modes of operation of the SecurityCouncil  we believe that the areas concerned will find theirappropriate modus operandi.In several regions of our planet  there are stilldecades-old conflicts  and new sources of tension arebreaking out in areas that previously enjoyed a certainpeace and stability. This offsets the most optimisticexpectations of our peoples  who had hoped that theworld would be on the threshold of a new era of peace inthis post-cold-war period  paving the way for cooperationand development.It is therefore with great apprehension that we notea proliferation of regional conflicts  social and economiccollapse in some of our countries  environmental decay and the coming of new scourges such as transnationalcrime  drug trafficking  a rising wave of criminality  racialdisturbances  xenophobia  and religious and culturalintolerance.It is in the face of this bleak picture that we cometogether for the fifty-first session of the GeneralAssembly  compelling us to pause in deep introspectionand firm resolve to handle this time bomb. In this context the Republic of Angola urges all Member States to dotheir very best in the search for ways and means toachieve this. One of the main tools available to us ispreventive diplomacy and the political resolve of all thosewho are in a position to make a decisive contribution tointernational peace and security.In the Middle East  recent events are showingdangerous trends  jeopardizing the Washington agreementon the autonomy of the Palestinian people and the firststeps towards the joint peaceful settlement of peace issuesin that region  all of which are matters of the greatestconcern to the Republic of Angola.The Republic of Angola reiterates the stand adoptedon the Middle East by African Heads of State orGovernment at the thirty-second summit meeting of theOrganization of African Unity  in Yaoundé  and appealsto the parties for strict compliance with theircommitments  because nothing can resist the resolve of apeople to be free. As stated by a great leader of ourcentury  Ho Chi Minh  “Nothing is more precious thanfreedom and independence”.We are likewise concerned at the grievous situationin East Timor  a non-autonomous territory illegallyoccupied by Indonesia  in violation of the principlesestablished in the United Nations Charter and applicableresolutions of the General Assembly and the SecurityCouncil.20My Government reaffirms that the United Nations hasa great responsibility vis-à-vis the people of East Timor andshould not fail in it. In this context  the Republic of Angolasupports and encourages dialogue between Portugal  theadministering Power  and Indonesia in search of asettlement that will bring self-determination andindependence to the people of Timor.We are  likewise  profoundly concerned by thedifficult social and economic situation in the Republic ofCuba resulting from the financial and economic blockadeimposed on that member State of the General Assembly.The Government of Angola supports the GeneralAssembly resolutions appealing for the lifting of theeconomic blockade in favour of the Cuban people  whichis suffering under the negative effects of that measure. Wetherefore encourage a dialogue with a view to normalizingrelations between those two sovereign Member States of theOrganization  which we call the United Nations  not thedivided nations.In the course of the next century  one of the greatestchallenges to the United Nations will be the protection andpromotion of human rights. The Government of Angola hasalways recognized the indivisible and universal character ofthe fundamental rights of every human being and theintrinsic correlation between human rights  democracy anddevelopment. Thus  at the Commission on Human Rightsand other forums  Angola has always categoricallycondemned selectivity and its politicization.We condemn human rights violations  wherever theymay occur. This attitude  however  should not serve as apretext for sectarianism  exerting pressures designed tocreate political instability in sovereign States  or theimplementation of hidden agendas. This practice harmsrather than fosters the promotion and protection of humanrights.Allow me to take this opportunity to inform theAssembly that  at the proposal of President José Eduardodos Santos  and in coordination with the United NationsCentre for Human Rights  the 32nd summit meeting of theHeads of State and Government of the Organization ofAfrican Unity decided to hold this year a ministerial-levelmeeting devoted exclusively to in-depth consideration of theissue of human rights in Africa. The Republic of Angolawill have the privilege of hosting this conference  which webelieve is of tremendous relevance in the lengthy anddifficult process of democratization in our continent.The crisis that is currently affecting the globaleconomy is mostly structural in nature and results frominconsistency  lack of coordination  and the adoption ofmacroeconomic policies incompatible with the growthneeds of the developing world. Of great concern is therealization that the current growth rate of some of ourcountries is often negative. This compels wholepopulations to lead lives of starvation and extremepoverty. It is indeed unfair that  at the threshold of thethird millennium  there are still some 800 millionmalnourished people across the world.Africa is the continent most lacking in capital andtechnology and  as a result  its population growth rate farexceeds its food-production capacity. In turn  thisincreases poverty and starvation and can lead to serioussocial unrest. These consequences can be avoided if weare able to rely on the understanding and goodwill of ourcreditors and major international financial institutions which impose economic management prescriptionswithout regard for each nation’s realities.In our view  one of the basic keys to the economicand social development of our countries lies in theexpansion and reorientation of economic cooperation fordevelopment. We must map out as soon as possible aglobal developmental strategy that will contribute to thesolution of the problems now affecting the survival of oureconomies.Today  our world has reached such a level ofinterdependence that new levels of interaction among oureconomies are required if we are to survive  enjoystability and avoid the threat of the imminent breakdownsuffered by the weaker nations. My Government reaffirmsits support for the United Nations special initiative onAfrica and  at the same time  underscores the need forgreater assurances of success  in view of our experiencewith similar programmes in the past. Once again  a wordof praise is due to the Secretary-General for this initiative which again demonstrates that the world  and the UnitedNations in particular  has not turned its back on Africa.If the African continent is to overcome its social andeconomic crisis  a broad marshalling of financial andother resources will be necessary before the end of thiscentury in order to meet the social and economicdevelopment needs of the continent. Likewise  we aredeeply concerned by the growth of the external debt ofAfrica and other developing countries  as well as by theheavy burden involved in debt servicing  which is one of21the causes of the continuous economic and socialdeterioration of our standard of living.We believe that a fair and lasting solution can befound for the African foreign-debt crisis  as long as there isunderstanding and a strong political resolve on the part ofcreditors. For certain developing nations  the negotiation ofa debt roll-over is a feasible solution. For the less-developed nations  however  the sole viable solution is totalforgiveness of the debt and a massive effort in the area ofinternational cooperation for development throughpartnerships. The strengthening of South-South cooperationand regional economic integration are processes that pavethe way for the establishment of a more equitable  newinternational economic order  free from measures ofprotectionism that hinder international trade and give rise todiscrimination against our nations.Of equal concern is the deteriorating food situation inAfrica due to drought and other natural disasters. This canbe addressed only through special assistance from theinternational community for the development of the foodand agricultural sectors and of food self-sufficiency inAfrican countries. We extend our best wishes for success tothe World Food Summit scheduled to take place inNovember in Rome  of which His Excellency Mr. JoséEduardo dos Santos will be a sponsor.My Government has focused special attention onissues of environment and human settlements and we takethis opportunity to underscore the positive impact in Angolaof the programmes and related activities in our continentsponsored by the United Nations Environmental Programmeand the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements. Inspite of all the difficulties it faces  Angola has spared noeffort in combating desertification and drought in Africa.We congratulate those countries that volunteered to host theConvention to Combat Desertification and urge all countriesto ratify it  thus enabling it to enter into force as soon aspossible.Illegal drug trafficking and the chemical-precursorstrade  together with money laundering  represent anotherscourge that is destabilizing our nations. Drug traffickingfor us  therefore  is an international problem requiringcooperation among all countries worldwide. With thesupport of the United Nations International Drug ControlProgramme and the assistance of other United Nationsspecialized agencies  my Government has drafted andsubmitted to our Parliament updated legislation relating toour struggle against the traffics in illegal drugs psychotropic substances and chemical precursors. This lawwas enacted recently  but we still lack the technical andexpert resources to ensure the success of that campaign.In southern Africa  we have coordinated our policiesin this area so as to score significant successes  bothnationally and regionally. The results are satisfactory andencouraging.Today  just as it was 51 years ago   the struggle forpeace continues to be one of the fundamental goals of ourOrganization. We must therefore devote all our effortsand energy to the creation of a better world instead ofpreparing for new wars of self-destruction.My Government has signed  and the AngolanParliament has just ratified  the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. We support the effortsto ban new nuclear tests. We also reiterate our appeal forrespect for and preservation of the African continent andits contiguous areas as a nuclear-free zone  in accordancewith the Pelindaba Treaty.The Republic of Angola is today one of thecountries in which the largest number of anti-personnelland-mines can be found. There are over 10 million mineslaid in Angolan territory. These mines have inflictedinnumerable casualties  and over 100 000 people havebeen mutilated in my country. My Government supportsall efforts towards a total ban on the production andexport of anti-personnel land-mines and their use indomestic or international conflicts.With the Assembly’s permission  I would like toaddress the situation in Africa  which today seems like acorpse on which vultures come to feed.Some countries of our continent still face seriousobstacles due to negative interference in the peace processand in their efforts to promote economic development  thewell-being of African peoples and the establishment ofpeace  security and political stability.The problem of conflicts in Africa is undoubtedlyone of the crucial issues affecting the development andstability of our continent. The Government of Angolawould like to praise the efforts of the Central Organ ofthe Organization of African Unity’s Mechanism forConflict Prevention  Management and Resolution invarious African regions and countries  such as Burundi Liberia and Somalia.22In this connection  we support the efforts of theneighbouring countries and others that advocate anegotiated political settlement for the crisis in Burundi onthe basis of the country’s constitutional legal order and inconsonance with the legitimate interests of the parties. Webelieve that if this objective is to be achieved  there mustbe a global dialogue among the parties concerned.We would like to pay tribute to the former Presidentof Tanzania  Mwalimu Julius Nyerere  for his efforts toreunite our Burundian brothers who have fallen into enmityaround the negotiating table. We are convinced that goodwill on the part of the politicians will help our sister nationof Burundi overcome its critical difficulties.Concerning Liberia  we would like to congratulate themember countries of the Economic Community of WestAfrican States (ECOWAS) for the significant progressmade so far  culminating in the swearing in ofMs. Ruth Perry as Chairperson of the Liberian Council ofState and the beginning of the belligerent parties’ processof disarmament.Unfortunately  we are still concerned over the situationof Somalia. We feel that in Somalia  as in the case of otherconflicts  there is no other way to find peace than throughdialogue between the parties concerned.We would like to reaffirm our support for thecountries in that region  and particularly for the PrimeMinister of Ethiopia in his efforts to bring the Somalifactions together around a negotiating table. We also feelthat the United Nations should not and cannot renounce itsduty and abandon that country to its fate.Finally  we cannot fail to restate our position ofprinciple regarding the issue of Western Sahara — namely our support for the United Nations and Organization ofAfrican Unity resolutions in that regard. We are convincedthat the problem can be resolved only through a referendumon the self-determination of that territory.We support a peaceful solution to the conflict  takinginto account the interests of the parties  particularly that ofthe Saharan people  and we offer congratulations on theresumption of direct talks between the Kingdom ofMorocco and POLISARIO.I would not wish to conclude my statement withoutapprising the Assembly in general terms of the situationprevailing in my country during the implementation of theLusaka Protocol  aimed at restoring lasting peace andreconciliation for all Angolans.Prior to doing so  however  I would like to expressthe sincere appreciation of the Government of Angola tothe Special Representative of the Secretary-General forAngola  Maître Alioune Blondin Beye  as well as to therepresentatives of the troika of observer nations —Portugal  the Russian Federation and the United States ofAmerica — for the unswerving efforts they have made individually and jointly  for peace and nationalreconciliation in Angola.Although the peace process has evinced a certaindynamism since the Franceville and Libreville meetingsbetween the President of the Republic His Excellency Mr. José Eduardo dos Santos  and theleader of UNITA  Mr Jonas Savimbi  we have beenconfronted with certain situations that are ratherunfavourable for its normal and desirable development.As the Assembly knows  the implementation of theLusaka Protocol included a calendar of specific tasks forthe Government and for UNITA.The position adopted by the UNITA leadershipconcerning the honouring of its commitments has unfortunately  given rise to deplorable situations in thecourse of the implementation of the Lusaka Protocol  inspite of the fact that the Government has gone beyondmeeting its commitments under the calendar.As a matter of fact  not only did UNITA fail tohonour its commitments and fail to comply with thepertinent Security Council resolutions  but it failed tocarry out fundamental commitments in the peace process:it failed to confine all its true military forces to quarters;it did not surrender its light and heavy matériel; it did notbring about the induction of all its general officers intothe regular armed forces of Angola  in accordance withthe agreement; it continued to create impediments anddifficulties in the selection and induction of 26 300 troopsinto the national army of Angola; and  finally  itprevented the free circulation of people and goods  thusdelaying the extension of the State administration over theentire national territory.As members know too  at its Congress  held from 20to 28 August this year  UNITA rejected the offer made toits leader by the Government of the position of Vice-President of the Republic. By so acting  UNITA createdan additional difficulty for the formation of the23Government of National Unity and Reconciliation. Thatattitude on the part of the leader of UNITA did not comeas a surprise to many observers of the Angolan peaceprocess because it is in keeping with Mr. Savimbi’shabitual lack of coherence. He has always placed his self-interest far ahead of the interests of the Angolan nation.Consequently  it is more than evident that UNITA is tryingto impose strategic delays on the peace process and theimplementation of the Lusaka Protocol  to aggravate thesocial and economic crisis and to distort the Protocol andother commitments assumed.However  despite the difficulties encountered in theprocess  the Angolan Government is resolute in its intent tospare no effort to resolve all the country’s problemsthrough dialogue and collective commitment. OurGovernment  working hand in hand with the democraticforces interested in peace and national reconciliation inAngola  has decided that  regardless of circumstances  wewill put an end to the cycle of strife that is disrupting thecountry. We will launch a new era of peace and politicaltolerance  strengthen democratic institutions and save theAngolan nation from the economic and social chaos intowhich it has been plunged by the stubborn attitude of thosewho try to block the wind with their bare hands.In this connection  I should like to thank theinternational community for its efforts and understanding inthe search for peace in Angola. We are aware of thetremendous costs involved in the operation of UnitedNations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM III)  butthis is a very sensitive juncture and the perseverance of theinternational community is of the essence  for victory iscertain. Only with the victory of peace and democracy inAngola can we say that the sacrifice of the internationalcommunity has been worthwhile.In the achievement of those objectives the participationof UNITA is essential. We therefore urge the internationalcommunity to continue to exert pressure to compel theleader of UNITA to follow a reasonable course  renouncingwar once and for all  and to persuade him to occupy hisposition in Angolan society.For more than 30 years the Angolan people have beensubjected to successive wars that have caused and stillcause indescribable suffering. After the election inSeptember 1992  Angola was once again plunged into a warthat forced all Government activities to be directed at anemergency social policy  the sole objective of which was tomitigate the nefarious consequences that afflicted the livesand dashed the hopes of Angolans.That conflict created over 2 million displacedpersons directly affected by the conflict; it drove over halfa million refugees into neighbouring countries andmaimed more than 100 000 people. In the economicsphere  it destroyed over 70 per cent of the social andeconomic infrastructure and the agro-industrial base.Those are only a few of the many indicators thatreveal the true dimensions of the catastrophe that hasbefallen Angolans and that has led to a seriousdeterioration in the humanitarian situation in the country.Given the tragic situation we described earlier  myGovernment is no longer in a position to face thischallenge on its own. What is at stake is the survival ofmillions of human beings.I should therefore like to take this opportunitysincerely to thank the international community andGovernments  as well as governmental and non-governmental organizations  for the assistance they haveextended to the Angolan people. I would implore them tocontinue to assist the needy population without losingsight of assistance for development and self-sufficiency.We peaceful Angolans and our Government will notabdicate our responsibilities.Once again  I extend our best wishes to the Presidentfor success as he presides over the General Assembly atthis session and pledge to him my delegation’s full andsincere cooperation."
"3",112,"ALB",51,1996,"﻿Let me begin by expressing my warmest congratulations toMr. Razali Ismail on his election to the presidency of theGeneral Assembly as well as my best wishes for hissuccess. I am pleased also to take this occasion to conveymy sincere appreciation to His Excellency Mr. DiogoFreitas do Amaral for the excellent manner in which heguided the proceedings of the Assembly during the previoussession. We wish also to pay tribute to the Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for hisinvaluable contribution and his tireless efforts in effectivelysteering the Organization.Despite many difficulties and financial problems  theUnited Nations is striving to play its irreplaceable role inthe service of peace and security through peacekeepingoperations and the promotion of international cooperation.The United Nations Blue Helmets have already becomesymbols of hope in the major areas of conflict throughoutthe world. The Albanian Government sincerely hopes thata lasting peace will be established in Bosnia andHerzegovina  Afghanistan  Tajikistan  Burundi  Liberia and everywhere else.The United Nations is undergoing the most severefinancial crisis in its history. This year alone  theOrganization ran out of money in its regular budget threetimes and was therefore forced to borrow funds from itspeacekeeping operations budget. The tasks of today andthe challenges of tomorrow require a general reform ofthe entire United Nations system. Albania has activelyparticipated in the debate on the preparatory process toreform the Security Council within the framework of theOpen-ended Working Group on the Question of EquitableRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of theSecurity Council. Albania is in favour of increasing thesize of the Council by two permanent seats: Germany andJapan. We also believe that options should be consideredthat relate to a broader representation of Member States in order to make the Council more efficient and betterable to fulfil its mandate.Revitalization of the Economic and Social Councilmust be part of the reform process. We all firmly believethat as long as wide economic gaps exist between Northand South  and East and West  several peoples andcountries will face key problems related to their survival and risks of tension  conflicts and regional hostility willprevail. For this reason  reform of the Security Councilwill not aid the cause of global peace and stability if it isnot accompanied by an equally effective reform of theEconomic and Social Council.After a long 50 years of communist rule  Albania hasnow been a democracy for five years. During this period ofdemocratic reform  it has had to face innumerable majorproblems  including its communist heritage  with itsassociated spirit of class struggle; and its extreme povertyand strict isolation. The country’s transition was renderedyet more difficult by the situation in the region  which wasweighted down by the crisis in the former Yugoslavia andthe related application of the sanctions regime for severalyears. Nonetheless  Albania has been able to evolve froma one-party to a multiple-party system; from repression tothe establishment of a State based on the rule of law and onrespect for human rights and minorities; from a highlycentralized and depressed economy to a growing  free-market economy; and from isolationism to openness toEuro-Atlantic integration.Albania’s gross domestic product has increasedannually  from 11 per cent in 1992 to 15 per cent in 1996.Inflation fell 400 per cent in 1992 and now stands at 7.5per cent in 1996. Our national currency’s exchange rate hasgained some stability  and our foreign debt has been paid.Although five years ago the economy was totallycentralized  privatization is now proceeding rapidly in allthe major economic sectors; at present 75 per cent ofoverall production comes from the private sector. Theunemployment rate has dropped from 39 per cent in 1992to 12 per cent in 1996. Within four years  Albania was ableto completely liberalize prices.Clearly  transforming a centralized economy into amarket economy is difficult and sometimes painful especially for certain economic sectors and for certainsegments of the population. I should like to take thisopportunity to again sincerely thank the European Union the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)  theWorld Bank  the European Bank for Reconstruction andDevelopment  the International Monetary Fund and anumber of United Nations specialized agencies for thevaluable assistance they have provided to my countryduring this period of transition. We are confident that theseinstitutions will continue to help Albania.Over the past four years  Albania’s prestige in theinternational arena has increased considerably  giving proofof its priority Euro-Atlantic orientation. Albania is alreadya member of the Council of Europe and an activeparticipant in the Partnership for Peace  and is working forits full integration into the North Atlantic TreatyOrganization and the European Union. In this regardAlbania highly appreciates the support of the memberStates of the European Union and is convinced that the timehas come to accelerate the process of Albania’sintegration. We also welcome the current progress beingmade in solidifying our relations with the United States which the Albanians consider to be the champion ofdemocracy and freedom. We are confident that theserelations  which are of great importance to Albania  willcontinue to develop.Albania’s regional policy is based on a desire topromote peace and stability in the Balkans. Given thegeo-strategic position of Albania  the deterioratingsituation of those Albanians living in exile in otherBalkan countries  and the prolonged crisis in the formerYugoslavia  the Albanian Government’s significantcontribution to regional peace and stability demonstratesits willingness to establish regional cooperation in linewith Euro-Atlantic trends. Determined to continue thispolicy and to increase its contribution  Albania hosted thefirst Conference of South-Balkans Defence Ministers which served as a first step leading to the Conference ofthe Ministers for Foreign Affairs  held in Sofia somemonths later. As part of this contribution  my country hasjust established a peacekeeping unit  now serving inZadar  Croatia within the framework of theImplementation Force (IFOR).The Albanian Government continues to believe thatthe question of the Balkans requires greater attention bythe international community and by the United Nations inparticular. The bitter history of the region and theprolonged conflict of recent years have proved clearly thatthe threat of war always looms large in countries whereultra-nationalism and chauvinism hold sway. We all areaware of the importance of the Dayton Agreement inresolving the conflict in the Balkans. We have alwaysstressed the importance of identifying the major cause ofthat conflict: Serb ultra-nationalism.While making a serious effort to assist in theimplementation of the Dayton Agreement  theGovernment of the Republic of Albania wishes onceagain to draw the attention of the United Nations to theserious problem of Kosovo. In the 1980s  Kosovo —more than 90 per cent of whose population consists ofAlbanians who have lived on their own territory forthousands of years — was the first to speak of the dangerthat Serb ultra-nationalism posed to the territories of theformer Yugoslavia. National chauvinism; ethnicintolerance; racial  economic and religious discrimination;“ethnic cleansing”; and acts of violence and repressionagainst an entire population — characteristic features ofSerb policy — were demonstrated for the first time in2Kosovo. In fact  the crisis in the former Yugoslavia beganin Kosovo  though at that time the international communitypaid scant attention to what the Albanians were saying. Itwas not until the crisis became a bloody conflict in Bosniaand Herzegovina that proper attention was paid.The Kosovo issue must be duly examined and treatedin the spirit of the Dayton Agreement. It is now consideredone of the serious international issues that must be resolved and it has been the subject of several documents anddecisions of the Organization for Security and Cooperationin Europe and of the United Nations. However  the situationin Kosovo is still tense and volatile. The fact that up tonow an armed conflict between the Albanians living inKosovo and the Serbs has been avoided — or rather resisted — is primarily the result of the peaceful policypursued by the legitimate political representatives of thepeople of Kosovo  and of the foreign policy of the AlbanianGovernment.We believe that Kosovo deserves a status that reflectsthe political will of its people as well as the internationalinstruments relating to the right of peoples to self-determination. The agreement on education in Kosovo recently reached by representatives of Kosovo andBelgrade  is a promising step towards further efforts fullyto guarantee the Kosovo Albanians basic freedoms andhuman and national rights. The Government of the Republicof Albania believes that through constructive dialogue  inthe presence of a credible international third party  asolution to this acute problem can be found.We thank the General Assembly for its considerationof the situation in Kosovo  particularly through itsresolutions 49/204 of 23 December 1994 and 50/190 of 22December 1995. We would like to take this opportunity toappeal once again to the international community tocontinue its efforts until this issue is definitively resolved.Albania’s foreign policy is characterized by efforts toestablish good relations with its neighbours. Albania hasalways been in favour of peace  stability  and economic andcultural cooperation with its neighbouring countries.Albania and Greece have been able to establish goodrelations  which are expanding and strengthening. TheGovernment of the Republic of Albania and the Albanianpeople are grateful to the Government and the people ofGreece for having supported us during our difficult periodof transition. The current positive developments inAlbanian-Greek relations show  to our great pleasure  thatin bilateral relations all problems can be solvedsatisfactorily and within a reasonable time-frame if there ispolitical good will and a serious commitment by bothsides. The friendly relations between our two countriesare concrete testimony of the achievements of both theGreek and the Albanian Governments. Good relationsbetween two neighbouring countries such as Albania andGreece show that the existence of national minorities inneighbouring countries can serve as a bridge of friendshipand become a connective link between countries. Therecognition and equal treatment of national minorities coupled with respect for the independence  sovereigntyand territorial integrity of each State  are essentialelements in such relations.The Albanian Government has taken steps to showits interest in establishing mutually beneficial relationswith the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.Albania was among the first countries to officiallyrecognize that State  while at the same time assuring it ofour readiness to work with it to establish strongerrelations in all fields  independently of the problemsrelating to the situation and the position of thoseAlbanians living in that State. My country believes thatthe normalization and improvement of relations withSerbia and Montenegro depends on Belgrade takingcertain steps  such as respecting the Dayton Agreement taking concrete measures to put an end to the violenceagainst and the suppression of the rights of the Albaniansin Kosovo  and making a serious commitment to apeaceful solution to the Kosovo question.Albania attaches particular importance to its relationswith its western neighbour  Italy. This ancient relationshiphas lasted as long as our peoples have lived in theMediterranean. In the framework of the European Union Italy has been one of the main donors to Albania. We arevery grateful to the Italian Government and people for thetremendous assistance they have given our country duringthis difficult period of transition  and for the spirit ofgood will that has always prevailed in our relations. Webelieve these things provide a solid basis for furtherpositive developments in the future.Before concluding my address before the Assembly allow me to assure members  on behalf of the AlbanianGovernment  of our continued support for the activities ofthe United Nations. We will continue to contribute to thestrengthening of the Organization and of its irreplaceablerole in the service of peace  security  progress anddemocracy throughout the world. My small country Albania  will always be committed to contribute activelyto all the work of the Organization.3"
"4",135,"AND",51,1996,"﻿Allow me first ofall to express the honour I feel as an Andorran at thedistinction that has been conferred on our small country bythis Assembly through your election  Mr. Minoves-Triquell as a Vice-President for this year’s session of the GeneralAssembly. I thank you for calling on me to address thisAssembly and assure you of the support of the people ofAndorra and  I am sure  of all those who speak the Catalanlanguage.I must also thank the outgoing President  Mr. DiogoFreitas do Amaral  for his excellent tenure at the helm ofthe General Assembly during the year of the fiftiethanniversary of the United Nations. I do this with thesatisfaction of congratulating an illustrious Portuguese  abrother from the Iberian peninsula who has been able togive this Assembly the necessary impetus to start off on theright foot and with hope for the new era of 50 years thatmust take us to the one hundredth anniversary of the UnitedNations. I wish also to convey to the new President  HisExcellency Mr. Razali Ismail  my warmest congratulationsand those of my country on his election  and I have thegreat pleasure of assuring him of the close collaboration ofthe Andorran Vice-President of the General Assembly  whowill always be at his service.Andorra looks to the future of the world withoptimism  sure that on this Earth men and women of goodwill will know how to overcome intolerance and injustice.In order to advance towards these objectives of progress we will have to count on the United Nations. Its reform which the Secretary General  at the call of all the States has promoted during these last years  will give us a moreefficient Organization  with more coordination and lesscostly duplication  responsible in the financial sphere andconcentrated on its mandate.My fellow citizens often ask me  “What can a smallcountry like Andorra bring to the United Nations?” We area State with very little land and with a population that wecount in six tens of thousands  and we lack the politicalweight the force of arms normally provides. However  oursmall size has been our good fortune. We have opted tolack armies and cannons since we destroyed all ourcountry’s fortifications in 1278. One day  we would hope that admirable action of the thirteenth-century Andorranswill be imitated by our century’s over-armed Powers large  mid-sized and small. Our small population has beena good school for human understanding and ourindividual and collective aspirations  allowing for theprecision of small-scale observation. Because we aresmall and peaceful  and because we have a lengthyhistory  we bring to the United Nations a vision of theworld that is patient and optimistic  and it is our beliefthat if we have lived in our territory without bellicoseconflict for more than 700 years  the same is also possiblebeyond our borders  for  in the end  the men and womenwho live in Andorra are different from the rest ofmankind only in their collective historical experience.It is the young people growing up in this latter partof the twentieth century who will pave the way to thethird millennium. I should thus like to make them themain point of my statement this year in the Assembly’sgeneral debate. Later  I will mention my State’s hopes forthe young who are today being educated in anunderstanding of the challenges of the United Nations andof the need to promote democracy and human rights asthe pillars of the peace  prosperity and justice for peoplesthat we are striving to attain  goals that  if we hurry inour task  we may be able to glimpse ourselves.Earlier  I indicated that Andorra trusts the future.One of the principal reasons for that trust is probably thefact that a great part of our population is young and thatour demographic pyramid is very different from those ofour Western European neighbours. When human beingsare young  everything seems possible. The energy we allpossess allows us to look forward with strength  withcourage and with hope. Raisons d’état  political evils economic imperatives  the belief that the end justifies themeans — all these have difficulty taking root in theyoung  since youth cares more about fidelity in friendship more about making its imprint on society. Youth hasidealism — something we too often criticize butsomething which feeds the genuine and vital fire thatcompels human beings to strive for dialogue and genuinecoexistence — to aspire  for example  to the UnitedNations.It is that aspect of the young that we must nourishif we desire a better world. Unfortunately  it is still verydifficult for many young people to seek the good ofmankind when in their own countries  cities or villages 9in their homes or in their families  they lack the most basicphysical or spiritual necessities  when the education theyare given is the official doctrine of a despotic regime andwhen — as was the case with their parents and theirgrandparents before them — what they eat today is themeagre wage of much sweat. In the developed countries unemployment among the young crushes the hopes of alarge part of today’s well-prepared generation  which willbe forced to waste the education that decades of economicprogress have enabled it to obtain. In States still striving toachieve development  in which 84 per cent of the world’spopulation between 15 and 24 years of age lives  thesituation is very worrying: AIDS  the rural exodus  poverty hunger  medical shortcomings  sexual exploitation  juveniledelinquency — problems that also affect the developedcountries — are particularly acute. Unemployment indeveloping countries is also a tragic evil. We know thatmore than 100 million new jobs will have to be created inthe next two decades to satisfy the growing young andactive population of the developing countries.In confronting these problems we who govern mustassume our responsibilities and give priority to policiesaffecting the young  especially those geared towardsfighting youth unemployment. One of the first areas wemust encourage is obviously that of training. Governmentsmust coordinate economic plans with training policies sothat students can learn professions that they will have somechance of practicing  as well as to prevent  insofar aspossible  an excess of graduates in saturated sectors. Wemust also give appropriate encouragement  throughprogrammes of coordination and technical assistance whennecessary  to the integration of young people into thecommunity. Small communities  when they work inconjunction with non-governmental organizations  payspecial attention to the management of resources and arewell aware of the needs of their young people.This joint effort is most appropriate when we recallthat we are living in an era in which society realizes thatbig government and its programmes sometimes give rise tomore expenditure than advantages and that fiscalresponsibility is of more benefit to the economy than is themultiplication of governmental departments  especially inthe developing countries  where the public sector is stillsuffering the consequences of large-scale programmes thathave not produced the results expected. In those States Governments will find it to their advantage to acknowledgethe value of fostering microcredits for young people withentrepreneurial projects. The example of Bangladesh  wheresuch credits have enabled many women to achieve financialindependence  is noteworthy in this respect. I would alsomention as an example of successful action theeducational measures for young entrepreneurs that someLatin American States have taken with a view to thecreation of new  small companies.At the United Nations  States must give directsupport to young people and to the programmes related tothem. More specifically  I am thinking of the WorldProgramme of Action for Youth to the Year 2000 andBeyond. That Programme  which was adopted by theGeneral Assembly on 14 December 1995  defines someof the problems that affect the world’s young people andindicates medical  educational and job-oriented prioritiesfor the next few years. We must enlarge on that text.States Members of the United Nations must collaboratewith the Secretariat in defining the Programme’spossibilities and putting it into practice in a concrete wayso that its message reaches all nations. What we do withtoday’s youth will define the twenty-first century.For the past year Andorra has actively participatedat the United Nations in the debates involving the young.On 26 October of last year  in commemorating the tenthanniversary of the International Youth Year  ourAmbassador spoke in this Hall on the benefits of teachingtolerance and human rights to young people in schools.Andorra has also contributed to the United Nations YouthFund.Earlier  at the March 1995 Copenhagen WorldSummit for Social Development  Andorra proposed a fulland specific commitment asking the Governments of theworld to foster dialogue between generations andachieved its incorporation into the Declaration by Headsof State and Government. Given the lack of specificreferences in many United Nations texts  this provides agood basis for subsequent studies on youth-relatedthemes.At this juncture  I should like to say that the fact thatwe concentrate our attention on youth must never lead usto forget members of older generations  particularly theelderly. Dignity in ageing must be recognized andpromoted  particularly today  when the progress ofmedicine is making possible the lengthening of humanlife. Intergenerational solidarity accompanied by dialogue is an integral theme of any policy geared to the supportof the young. Indeed  when we talk of giving primaryattention to youth  that must not mean a glorification ofthe first decades of human life to the detriment of oldage. On the contrary  it should mean a recognition of the10determining role that young people play in what willhappen later.I should like for a moment to pay a tribute here to ageneration of young people which the media has of latecharacterized as being “lost” — the young people of Bosniaand other parts of the former Yugoslavia who  not so manyyears ago  were confident children of Europe and who havenow spent their youth amidst fratricidal struggles and“ethnic cleansing”  with all the revulsion inherent in thatexpression  a youth spent between death and barbarism.Andorra  which  during the Spanish Civil War and laterduring the Second World War  was a land of welcome andrefuge for other lost generations of other wars — alsofratricidal  and  indeed  if all human beings are brothers what war is not fratricidal? — feels solidarity with theseyoung people of Bosnia  upon whom has fallen theresponsibility for building a new coexistence and forerasing from the collective consciousness these past yearsof propaganda and demagoguery and for breaking with thehistory of confrontation that afflicts the Balkans.Bosnia is not the only place where we have witnesseddifficult times. Angola  Afghanistan  Cambodia  Liberia Sierra Leone  Somalia  Haiti  Guatemala  El Salvador Burundi  Rwanda  Iraq and many other places have inrecent years been affected by conflicts of great complexity.Some of these problems have already been solved orattenuated  often thanks to United Nations action.Developments in the situation in El Salvador are a goodexample. Other conflicts continue  a cause of greatconsternation to the international community.My Minister of Foreign Affairs reminded us last year in this Assembly Hall  of the considerable increase inmilitary personnel deployed for the United Nations in recentyears. At the beginning of 1988  there were just over 9 000Blue Helmets in the world engaged in peacekeepingoperations. Seven years later  there are over 70 000 — thisin spite of the fact that the military and logistical means ofimmediate action are not in the hands of this internationalOrganization.Ultimately  we — the States that decide how thisOrganization shall act — are the ones responsible forfailing to end or prevent conflicts. Criticism must beconstructive. When we accuse the United Nations of a lackof action in Bosnia  let us ask ourselves why the policies ofthe members of the Security Council are so divergent anddifficult to coordinate. We must therefore make an effort toprovide information so that the public has an accurate ideaof what really happens behind the flags that adorn thisbuilding. We must make the successes of the UnitedNations known  not just its shortcomings. We musthighlight its efforts to promote international law  a bodyof law that will guarantee negotiated solutions instead ofshows of strength  a principle that is essential for thesurvival of small States. We must recognize the small quiet steps humanity takes day by day in United Nationscommittees  steps geared towards the promotion andapplication of human rights. If in a particular State somepeople  be it only a few  no longer suffer torture orrepulsive abuse when they are arrested; if in some partsof the world blood is not shed because internationalshame projects itself on those countries; if in other places nuclear tests will not shatter the peace of the peopleliving there because we have signed a treaty prohibitingsuch actions  then the United Nations deserves all oursupport.We must foster confidence in the future of men andwomen  not cynicism towards international organizations.If we do not  we run the risk of encouraging movementsthat seek to express this cynicism through violence andterrorist acts. We have no choice but to consider themeans democracy gives to its enemies that they can useto destroy it  particularly through terrorism. When themedia tell us that the United Nations is a potentialterrorist target  we become even more conscious of ourcommitment to strengthening efforts more effectively topublicize the task of our Organization. The energies ofour youth must not be directed towards violentexpressions of social discomfort. We must thereforechannel them  as I have stated before  towards creativityin one’s work and promoting confidence in humanity’spotential. When  a few years ago  the political scientistFrancis Fukuyama  as witness to the end of the cold war wrote about the end of history  he forgot about theimmense creativity of human beings. When one period ofhistory ends  another one begins. Our responsibility is toensure that the period of history we have entered in thenineties rejects the obscurantism produced by the fearperpetuated by human beings  and reflects the qualitieshumanity holds highest.The framing of a Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-BanTreaty (CTBT)  which I will sign tomorrow on behalf ofthe Andorran Government  along with many of therepresentatives here  is an achievement of which theUnited Nations Organization can feel proud and a clearexample of what we can do when the peoples of theworld unite with the strength of an ideal of peace.Andorra  an initial co-sponsor of the resolution thatbrought this Treaty to the General Assembly  adheres to11its principles in full  principles which provided the basis forthe founding of our country. In the same fashion  not verylong ago we gave top priority to acceding to the Treaty onthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons with the hope ofpromoting that text of peace. Peace! The cry of alignmentfor the traditionally neutral States  one of the most noblecries  is — let us not fool ourselves — still far from beinganswered. The CTBT is only the first step  and an essentialone  towards more efforts to ensure nuclear disarmamentand non-proliferation  and the reduction of other types ofarsenals — goals to which Andorra will devote muchattention.To help achieve these objectives  the Government ofAndorra has a mandate of solidarity which is enshrined inour Constitution. In its preamble  the Andorran peopledeclare themselves eager to make every effort to promotevalues such as freedom  justice  democracy and socialprogress  to maintain and strengthen Andorra’s harmoniousrelations with the rest of the world on the basis of mutualrespect  coexistence and peace  and willing to bring theircollaboration and effort to all the common causes ofhumankind.At present  States  large or small  within theframework of the United Nations  have a duty to provide asource of inspiration for the ideals of youth  preventisolationism and look beyond their borders  shareexperiences and show solidarity with States in distress. Thisnotwithstanding  Governments continue to have afundamental role in the internal activities of States  so thatfew United Nations efforts and initiatives can really beeffective without their active cooperation.For this reason  the leaders of States who  year afteryear  gather in this Assembly Hall must leave hereconvinced of our unavoidable responsibility to promotehuman rights within our own borders and social andeconomic development in our States.In accordance with article 29 of the Convention on theRights of the Child  which Andorra signed and ratified lessthan a year ago  thus contributing to the universal processof ratification so desired by the United Nations Children’sFund (UNICEF)  it is vital that Governments ensure thattolerance and human rights are taught freely andcomprehensively at school in order to rear new generationsthat are much more sensitive to the universality andrelevance of these rights. We must also encourage Statesstill using other forms of government to adopt democraticprocesses  and make the rule of law a priority for leaders inthe coming years. There are no peoples unprepared fordemocracy  only leaders with little aptitude for fosteringit.I wanted to introduce a spirit of optimism in myspeech today. When optimism does not conceal reality but instead tries to transcend it  it is the best remedyagainst the apathy that can affect the human heart in aworld full of conflict. I have spoken of youth and itsoptimism  and of the need to focus our attention on theproblems affecting youth. I have lauded the successes ofthe United Nations  but I have also noted the difficultieswe will have to overcome if the United Nations  is toenjoy qualitative growth. I have advocated the teaching ofhuman rights  of democracy  of tolerance  and of socialand individual responsibility for the progress of humancommunities. Four years before the new millennium  wemust give our youth optimism and confidence in thefuture.One year ago  the Minister for Foreign Affairs ofAndorra concluded his statement before this Assemblywith some words by Robert Kennedy. Previously  mypredecessor in the presidency of the AndorranGovernment borrowed from John Fitzgerald Kennedy theexpression “Ich bin ein Berliner” to declare himself anAndorran in a speech on the particularities of smallStates. To make reference to the Kennedys is to makereference to an optimistic decade imprinted with theideals and dreams that a young American President spreadaround the world. It was also a decade of harsh realitiesand contradictions  as in the world today. Ideals  however last because there is always a new generation to adoptthem. Today I reiterate the promise that PresidentKennedy made to the United Nations:“To that world assembly of sovereign states the United Nations  our last  best hope in an agewhere the instruments of war have far outpaced theinstruments of peace  we renew our pledge ofsupport to prevent it from becoming merely a forumfor invective  to strengthen its shield of the new andthe weak  and to enlarge the area in which its writmay run”."
"5",180,"ARE",51,1996,"﻿It gives me great pleasure to extend to you Sir  on behalf of the delegation of the United ArabEmirates  our congratulations on your election as Presidentof this session of the General Assembly. Your election isindeed an expression of the international community’s faithin your competence and vast diplomatic expertise  and ofthe high esteem in which we hold your friendly country Malaysia. At the same time  allow me to thank sincerelyyour predecessor  who so ably led the deliberations of theprevious session of the General Assembly.I should also like to take this opportunity to pay awarm tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. BoutrosBoutros-Ghali  for the positive and important role he hasplayed in the past few years. My country supports hisre-election for a second term and appreciates his efforts toenhance the role of the Organization in the maintenance ofinternational peace and security.The fifty-first session of the United Nations GeneralAssembly is being held amid new internationalcircumstances and developments that have both positivelyand negatively affected the global scene. Despite therelative optimism that has permeated internationalrelations  threats to peace and security and to economic social and human development worldwide still remain.The present détente in regional and international relationsdoes not necessarily mean that the international climatehas become more harmonious or homogenous. Thesecurity and political independence of small States is stillthreatened by the ambitions of States aspiring to spreadtheir hegemony and expand at the expense of theirneighbours.The political situation in the Arabian Gulf regionduring the past two decades has made us increasinglyconvinced of the importance of rebuilding confidenceamong the countries of the region. This confidence mustbe anchored in the principles of full and mutual respectfor the sovereignty  territorial integrity and non-interference in the internal affairs of States  and ofrefraining from the threat or use of force. Every State hasthe right to choose its political  economic and socialsystem  to preserve its natural resources and to resort topeaceful negotiations as a means of settling disputeswithin the context of bilateral  regional and internationalinitiatives and endeavours.We also support the peaceful efforts currently underway to complete the demarcation of borders among theStates of the region in order to enhance the nationalsovereignty of each State. This will contribute to theachievement of lasting peace  security and stability in theregion.Inspired by our tradition  our history and ourcommitment to peace  we in the United Arab Emiratesfirmly believe that the Charter of the United Nations andthe principles of international law are the proper means ofsettling disputes among nations.Twenty-five years have passed since the occupation bythe Islamic Republic of Iran of our three islands  GreaterTunb  Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa. These are Arab islands both in their history and in their origin. They are the pillarsof our national sovereignty  territorial integrity and overallinalienable national rights. Since the beginning of theconflict  the United Arab Emirates has called on the IranianGovernment to end its occupation of the islands and toenter into bilateral negotiations or seek the arbitration of theInternational Court of Justice. Referring the case to theInternational Court of Justice will ensure that each State hasa chance to submit the relevant legal and historicaldocuments and evidence to support its claim of sovereigntyover the three islands.Despite our declared peaceful intentions  the mediationefforts of some friendly countries and the good offices ofthe Secretary-General  the Iranian Government rejected ourpeaceful endeavours. It has established and equippedfacilities on the three islands whose features are notexclusively civilian. It has built an electrical power plant onGreater Tunb; and an airport  a refrigeration plant and afish-processing plant on Abu Musa. Moreover  Iraniannationals  mostly from the military  have been settled on theislands. We view this as a clear act of provocation aimedat changing the demographic character of the islands andimposing a new fait accompli. Through these acts and byignoring the repercussions of such a policy on the peaceand security of the region and on international navigation Iran has consolidated its illegitimate occupation.The Islamic Republic of Iran has failed to heed therepeated  serious and sincere appeals made by the UnitedArab Emirates  the Gulf Co-operation Council  the ArabStates of the Gulf  the last Arab Summit meeting  theCouncil of the League of Arab States and the States partiesto the Damascus Declaration to settle the dispute throughpeaceful means. This violates not only our country’snational sovereignty  but also international law and all theinternational principles  norms and practices governingrelations among States  particularly among neighbouringStates.We therefore call on the Government of Iran todismantle all the illegitimately established civilian andmilitary facilities on our three islands. We also call uponIran to respond to the peace initiatives we have advancedand which are supported by sisterly and friendly peace-loving countries; to enter into unconditional bilateralnegotiations conducive to a peaceful settlement of thedispute; or to refer the case to the International Court ofJustice.Security  stability and sustainable development areurgent needs of societies all over the globe. My country which has always supported the inalienable rights ofpeoples to resist occupation and aggression  condemns allforms of terrorism and the acts of subversion andsabotage facing the international community today. In thisconnection  we agree with and support all the measurestaken by the State of Bahrain to preserve its security  itsnational sovereignty and its political independence.In this context  we reiterate our full support for theKingdom of Saudi Arabia in its fight against terrorism inall its forms and manifestations  and against all threats toits national security. We believe that the member Statesof the Gulf Co-operation Council are bound by thethreads of a common destiny defined by the requirementsof peace and security of the whole region. Terrorismdefies all international norms and practices and runscounter to religious and cultural beliefs  which are thepillars of stability and prosperity for all societies. It musttherefore be addressed in an international context.The United Arab Emirates has followed with graveconcern the recent developments in Iraq. We reaffirm theimportance we attach to preserving Iraq’s nationalsovereignty and territorial integrity. We oppose anyinterference in its internal affairs and the establishment byneighbouring States of safety zones on its territory. In thesame context  we support all the measures taken by theState of Kuwait to preserve its sovereignty  security andterritorial integrity.The escalating human suffering of the Iraqi peopleand the spread of disease and malnutrition call for theimmediate and full implementation of Security Councilresolution 986 (1995). However  the ultimateresponsibility for the alleviation of the suffering of theIraqi people rests solely with the Government of Iraq.This can be realized only when the Iraqi Governmentcomplies fully with its international obligations under therelevant Security Council resolutions. Those obligationsinclude the release of all Kuwaitis and other nationals2imprisoned or detained by Iraq and the return of all Kuwaitiproperty still in its possession.My country supported the Agreement on Principlesconcluded between the Republic of Yemen and Eritrea onthe Hanish archipelago. We renew our call to the twoGovernments to commit to the principle of peacefulsettlement through international arbitration so that peaceand security can prevail in this region. We take thisopportunity to express our appreciation to the Governmentof France for its mediation efforts.The United Arab Emirates welcomed the peacenegotiations in the Middle East  beginning with the MadridConference through the subsequent agreements relative tothe question of Palestine. We are disappointed by theposition of the Israeli Government  which has not honouredthe commitments entered into by its predecessor. The IsraeliGovernment has refused to withdraw from the city ofHebron  and has embarked on an expansion of itsillegitimate settlement activities. More recently  it openeda tunnel adjacent to Al-Haram al-Sharif  the NobleSanctuary  which threatens the structures of the Al-AqsaMosque and alters the demographic character and legalstatus of the city of Jerusalem. This is an act of provocationthat will arouse the feelings of Arabs and Muslims  and willobstruct the achievement of a just  comprehensive andlasting peace settlement to the Middle East problem and thePalestinian question.At the Security Council meeting held last week  theinternational community reaffirmed its solidarity with thePalestinian people  its support of the peace process  and itsopposition to all the measures recently taken by the IsraeliGovernment. The United Arab Emirates condemns all theacts of violence recently committed by the Israeli occupyingauthorities against the Palestinian people  which resulted infiring at and thus the martyrdom of many Palestinians  inaddition to the injuries sustained by many more. We call onthe Israeli Government to put an end to its barbaricpractices  which run counter to the most basic norms ofinternational humanitarian law.The Arab parties are determined to pursue the peaceprocess as an objective and a strategic option to which thereis no alternative. This calls for a reciprocal commitment bythe Israeli side  without any further delay or procrastination.This commitment must be proven by the actual unconditional implementation of all relevant agreementsthus far concluded  to enable the Palestinian people toexercise their legitimate rights  including their right to self-determination and to the establishment of their ownindependent State  with Jerusalem as its capital. It mustalso include full Israeli withdrawal from the Syrian Golanto the 4 June 1967 line  and from southern Lebanon andthe western Bekaa  to the internationally recognizedb o r d e r s   p u r s u a n t t o S e c u r i t y C o u n c i lresolutions 242 (1967)  338 (1973) and 425 (1978)  andthe principle of land for peace. These measures willguarantee balanced and equitable security for all theStates of the region  and realize their peoples’ aspirationsfor a new era of comprehensive economic and socialdevelopment.We fully subscribe to the international call for aregional and international nuclear-test ban  and for theestablishment of international zones free of all weaponsof mass destruction  particularly nuclear weapons. Theseweapons pose a grave danger to our health  ourenvironment and our natural resources. I recently had thehonour to sign  on behalf of the United Arab Emirates the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty  thusenhancing its universality. We call upon the internationalcommunity and the relevant international bodies to spareno effort to make the Middle East and the Arab Gulfregion a zone free of all weapons of mass destruction including nuclear weapons. The international communitymust call on Israel to accede to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  and to comply with theinternational safeguards regime of the InternationalAtomic Energy Agency.Despite the efforts and good offices of the League ofArab States and the United Nations to save Somalia fromits predicament  the civil war there continues unabated and the deteriorating humanitarian situation is cause forgrave concern. We therefore appeal to the rival Somalifaction leaders to shoulder their responsibility and bringthis tragic bloodshed to an end. They must set aside theirdifferences and form a national Government representingall the factions of the Somali people  a Government thatcan restore to Somalia its national unity  territorialintegrity  security and stability.Political developments in the Republic of Bosnia andHerzegovina testify to the importance that theinternational community attaches to the Dayton PeaceAgreement  with a view to restoring normal conditions inthe Republic. My country supported that Agreement. Weconsider it the first constructive step on the road to a justand permanent settlement of the Balkan problem. Wewelcome the results of the recent elections in theRepublic of Bosnia Herzegovina. We hope that theseelections will safeguard the territorial integrity of the3Republic and contribute to the establishment of democraticinstitutions. We also hope that they will help restore normalrelations among the Bosnian people and pave the way forreconstruction  following the war’s devastation. Peace security and stability can then return to this tormentedregion. We take this opportunity to stress the importance ofbringing to justice war criminals who have committedheinous crimes against humanity and humanitarianinternational law in the former Yugoslavia.The tragic events  raging wars and civil strife  anduntold human suffering of the peoples of some Africancountries  are cause for grave concern. In view of thehistoric relations that bind our countries together  wereiterate our support for the efforts of the Organization ofAfrican Unity in cooperation with the United Nations tocontain the conflicts by peaceful means so that theirpeoples’ aspirations to peace  security  stability anddevelopment may be realized.The economic and social gap between the nations ofthe world is still wide in spite of positive political andeconomic developments on the regional and internationalscene  the creation of economic blocs  and free trade in theworld. This has led to the exacerbation of poverty  illiteracyand disease in many developing countries. Those countriesare already ailing under the heavy burden of debt and debt-servicing  and are suffering from the deterioration of livingstandards and dwindling development assistance fromdeveloped countries  in addition to trade barriers adverselyaffecting their economies.The world conferences held over the past five yearsachieved important results  and their recommendations havebecome important strategies aimed at creating an equitableand prosperous international environment. The internationalcommunity  which is still plagued by persistent violence organized crime  drugs and terrorism  must translate theserecommendations into a reality that will guarantee equitableeconomic and social development and the free flow of tradebetween the developed and the developing countries.We firmly believe that this Organization stillrepresents mankind’s conscience in the face of lingeringworld problems. To enhance its role under the Charter  theinternational community needs to provide the necessarypolitical  financial and moral support to the Organization.We must undertake major structural reforms  enlarge theSecurity Council membership in accordance with theprinciple of equitable geographic distribution  and improvethe functioning of the General Assembly  the Economic andSocial Council and the specialized agencies  so that theycan respond adequately to current regional andinternational developments.I would also like to stress the importance ofcooperation  consultation and coordination between theUnited Nations and regional organizations. Theseorganizations can assist the United Nations to arrive at abetter understanding of regional problems that can affectpeace  security and sustainable development.In conclusion  we hope that our aspirations will findproper expression in the commitment by the States of theworld to the Charter of the United Nations and theprinciples of international law. We look forward to therealization of the noble objectives of this Organization."
"6",227,"ARG",51,1996,"﻿May I first extend to Mr. Razali Ismail mywarmest and most sincere congratulations on his12unanimous election as President of this important session ofthe General Assembly.I recently accompanied President Carlos Saul Menemon a visit to his country  and I have the most pleasantmemories of his countrymen’s hospitality  of the vitality ofhis culture and of the extraordinary strength of hiscountry’s economy.To Ambassador Freitas do Amaral  who presided overthe Assembly at the last session  we express our mostsincere admiration. His term was a year full of difficultiesand challenges  and he left us a positive vision of thequestions of the future.I have had the privilege of participating in the generaldebate for the last six years. During that period  significantchanges have come about and profound contrasts havearisen in the world. The scepticism of somenotwithstanding  allow me to recall some of the progressmade on the international scene: we have improvedmechanisms for international peace and security; we haveadvanced in the universal consolidation of democracy andtolerance; we have created institutions to prevent veryserious crimes that offend the world’s conscience fromgoing unpunished  which clearly reflects the concept thatjustice and the law are inseparable components of a stablepeace; we have successfully stepped up intense collectivework towards non-proliferation of nuclear and conventionalweapons  including anti-personnel mines. The adoption ofthe Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban-Treaty willundoubtedly contribute to greater progress  as will the entryinto force of the Convention on the Prohibition of theDevelopment  Production  Stockpiling and Use of ChemicalWeapons and on Their Destruction. We have also begun toarticulate the concept of sustainable development to ensureprogress for current generations without compromising theviability of such progress for those of the future. We haveopened new paths to free trade  eliminating barriers which until yesterday  were regarded as normal instruments ofnational policy.All this has happened in recent years  and it is onlyfitting to recognize that the Secretary-General hasanticipated  promoted and reflected all this in his annualreports  in his Agenda for Peace and in his Agenda forDevelopment  documents that are essential for theinterpretation of the process begun at the end of the coldwar.Allow me to take this opportunity to state how mycountry has dealt with all these transformations. Argentinahas actively promoted the new agenda. It has adapteditself domestically and internationally to fulfil theobjectives and principles of the Charter  both in its letterand its new spirit.Argentina has consolidated democracy and has takena very active role in the defence of fundamental rightsand freedoms. It has given constitutional status to theUniversal Declaration of Human Rights and to the mainhuman rights treaties to which it is a party.Argentina has got its economy in order and openedup new possibilities and potential for its people bypromoting good governance  fiscal discipline accountability in the management of public funds equality before the law for domestic and foreign investorsand the fight against corruption.In particular  Argentina has presented and promotedin the Organization of American States (OAS)  as well asin this Assembly and other international organizations initiatives to combat the curse of corruption  which is anenemy to development  investment and charity in society.In Argentina  sustainable development goes beyondacademic discussions. The growing deterioration of theozone layer in the southern hemisphere has affected thedaily life and health of the population of southernPatagonia. Argentina  in cooperation with other countriesin the region and the United Nations system  has assumeda leading role in reducing the risk level for the affectedpopulations by establishing five ozone-layer monitoringstations in our national territory  incorporating them intothe world multilateral environmental monitoring system.We strongly hope that the international community willjoin us in this effort by taking the necessary actions tocooperate in protecting the atmosphere.In our subregion  the southern cone of the Americas Argentina  together with its neighbours  has played asignificant role in eradicating distrust  in resolving borderproblems  in promoting physical and economic integrationand in fostering political cooperation  all of which havegenerated an exemplary framework for cooperation andconvergence.On the basis of political and economic stability  wehave designed ambitious mechanisms for integration  andwe have made the Southern Cone Common Market13(MERCOSUR) and the Rio Group important channels forour foreign policy.In the agreements signed at the last MERCOSURpresidential summit  the States parties — Brazil  Paraguay Uruguay and Argentina — ratified their commitment todemocratic institutions. As our country sees it  this shouldbe a prerequisite for full membership in MERCOSUR. TheStates parties established a mechanism for consultation andpolitical cooperation aimed at reviewing internationalactivities of special interest to them.At that time  agreements were also signed betweenMERCOSUR and Chile and Bolivia  which willsignificantly broaden MERCOSUR and launch oureconomies into an ever more globalized system. Clearevidence of this is the adoption of the interregionalframework agreement between MERCOSUR and theEuropean Union  which has given rise to positiveexpectations and created opportunities for strengtheninglinks between the two regions in the economic  political andcultural fields.Argentina has promoted common activities on issuesof growing importance  such as protection of theenvironment  preservation of natural resources and socialand human development  within the framework of regionalmechanisms for dialogue and political cooperation  as wellas bilaterally  in regional forums and at the United Nations.Argentina participated in the adoption of concrete decisionsto fight terrorism  drug trafficking and corruption  whichare the new threats to international peace and security.Argentina’s natural interest in the South Atlantic isreflected in our participation in the zone of peace andcooperation in the South Atlantic  which embraces countriesfrom both sides of the ocean in constituting an area towhich we attach special significance.Member States of the zone are committed torespecting sovereignty and territorial integrity  promotingdemocracy  human rights and civil liberties  joining effortsfor nuclear non-proliferation and de-nuclearization  and tocooperating in the struggle against drug trafficking. We arevery pleased with our contribution to maintaining  togetherwith other coastal States  the political balance and economicpotential of the South Atlantic.However  there is still an important unresolved issue:the persistent sovereignty dispute over the Malvinas  SouthGeorgia and South Sandwich Islands and their surroundingmaritime spaces.During these last six years  I have come to thisforum to voice the claims of the Government and peopleof Argentina in the sovereignty dispute over the MalvinasIslands.It is incomprehensible that while Argentina and theUnited Kingdom have overcome the sorrow and have leftbehind their mutual disagreements and distrust and builtup a harmonious and constructive relationship — and wesee the positive results of this day by day — they havenot so far been able to comply with the resolutions of theGeneral Assembly and of the Decolonization Committeeand to progress in the dialogue towards a definitivesolution to this dispute. We have not even been able to sitdown together around a table to talk  even if only toexpress our disagreement.In the same spirit that encouraged our two countriesto cooperate in the South Atlantic for the protection of itsrenewable and non-renewable resources  we shouldadvance in our search for a peaceful solution to thisdispute.In spite of our efforts  the lack of direct links withthe Malvinas impedes human contacts  trade and tourism among other possible exchanges  and has slowed downthe economic and cultural development of the SouthAtlantic. The lack of relations between the two areas isinconceivable in today’s world.Argentina is proud of its great cultural diversity.Since the birth of our nation  our laws have preserved andguaranteed such cultural heritage. Our nationalConstitution establishes the objective of recovering theMalvinas Islands and the full exercise of sovereignty  andensures respect for its inhabitants’ way of life. The onlything lacking is the will to start a new phase together.Argentina is firmly convinced that a new era shouldbegin in the South Atlantic  as an area free fromtensions — a place where different cultures committed tohumanistic ideals and with a common wish for progressand well-being may come together.What in the past has been a negative factor in ourrelations should become a positive factor and a startingpoint for a new relationship.My country has shown its vocation for constructiveparticipation in the areas created by the internationalsystem  fostering tolerance and preserving peace. In thatrespect  we avidly support all efforts to resolve situations14of serious instability and conflict still existing in variousparts of the world.In the Middle East  we welcome the progress made inthe peace process  especially regarding the question ofPalestine. We add our voice to those calling for the partiesinvolved to maximize their efforts to achieve a just  lastingand comprehensive peace. We renew our offer of fullcooperation to contribute to the attainment of that objective.The peace process  fostered by this General Assembly  hasborne fruits that should not go to waste.United Nations peacekeeping operations are one of themost effective tools for preventing violence around theworld. This explains our full support for peace missions.We have responded promptly and unconditionally torequests of the Security Council  agreeing to participate inoperations in our hemisphere and in various other parts ofthe world by providing large amounts of financialresources.We deem it vital to ensure an orderly transitionbetween peace-keeping operations and the work ofreconstruction aimed at reversing the economic  politicaland social damage caused by conflicts and to offer effectivehumanitarian assistance so as to reduce the suffering of thepopulations affected.With the objective of complementing United Nationsemergency humanitarian assistance  Argentina  inspired byPresident Carlos Saul Menem  proposed the “WhiteHelmets” initiative. The effective deployment of the “WhiteHelmets” in many humanitarian assistance operations isalready proving their political and technical viability.The United Nations is called upon to play a significantrole in the international system of the twenty-first century.Everything indicates that this system will be marked bygrowing globalization and that problems such as poverty unemployment  corruption and the lack of education can bemore effectively dealt with at a global level. For the UnitedNations to respond effectively to this increasingly broad andcomplex mandate  it will be imperative for Member Statesto renew their political commitment to the organization’spolitical future. At the same time  it will be necessary tostrengthen the United Nations through the in-depthstreamlining and reform process that has already begun.With respect to the Security Council  we continue tofavour a mechanism that  without affecting its efficiency reflects new realities  of which Argentina is an active part and ensures the participation of those who have clearlydemonstrated their commitment to and respect for thepurposes and principles of the Charter. It is equallyimportant to ensure that the working methods of theCouncil guarantee transparency in the debates and indecision-making processes. Only in this way will theOrganization become a special forum for nations tochannel their resources effectively and successfully facethe challenges of a globalized world."
"7",252,"ARM",51,1996,"﻿At the outset  I would liketo congratulate the President on his election to thepresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-first session.Given his talent and experience  I am confident that he willguide this session to a successful completion of the noblemission entrusted to it by the Charter of the United Nations.I would also like to express my appreciation andthanks to his predecessor  Mr. Diogo Freitas Do Amaral for his outstanding leadership in accomplishing the tasks ofthe last session.The end of the cold war has given a decisiveimpetus to globalization by offering former socialisteconomies the opportunity to assume their rightful placein the world economy. The challenges posed by extremelyrapid transformation are nowhere more graphicallydepicted than in the current transition of the countries ofEastern and Central Europe and in the former Union ofSoviet Socialist Republics.In addition to severe economic and social problemsresulting from the extraordinary changes buffeting thecountry  the transition process in Armenia has beenexacerbated by the transport and energy blockade byneighbouring Azerbaijan  the devastation caused by themassive earthquake of 1988  the conflict betweenNagorny-Karabakh and Azerbaijan and the presence ofmore than 300 000 refugees.Despite such serious circumstances  economicreforms begun after the declaration of independence in1991 have been continued and expanded over the pastyear. Having achieved a fair degree of economic stability the Government of Armenia has designed a medium-termeconomic programme for 1996-1998. Armenia’s medium-term policy objectives are to maintain financial stabilityand establish the institutions and mechanisms of a marketeconomy by the end of the programme period in order tolay the foundation for sustainable growth and a viablebalance of payments. Consistent with this strategy  themain macroeconomic objectives of the programme are toraise the economic growth rate from 5 per cent in 1995to 7 per cent in 1998; to lower inflation to 8 per cent bythe end of 1998; and to narrow the current account deficitfrom 26 per cent of the gross domestic product in 1995to 12 per cent in 1998. To cope with the social pressuresinvolved in the transition process  the reorientation ofsocial expenditures towards the most vulnerable remainsa high-priority task. The programme lays emphasis onimproving the targeting of the social safety net andintensifying efforts to rationalize social expenditures.While each country is responsible for its owneconomic policies for development  in accordance with itsspecific situation and conditions  the reactivation ofeconomic growth and development in all countriesrequires a concerted effort of the international community.Here  particular attention should be given to the needs ofthe countries with economies in transition  without thisaffecting development assistance to the developingcountries.5The completion of the transition process  theintegration of these countries into the world economy andtheir effective involvement in the multilateral institutionswill have a positive impact not only on these countriesthemselves  but also on the global economy.As we approach the twenty-first century  it is thecollective responsibility of the international community toensure that  within the multidimensional and integratedcharacter of its mandate  the United Nations system isequipped to show leadership in the fulfilment of thecommitments made to international cooperation fordevelopment.In this context  the United Nations System-wideSpecial Initiative for Africa exemplifies the system’scommitment to collaborative action and its renewedcommitment to supporting Africa’s development. Launchedlast March by the Secretary-General  this Initiative is thelargest coordinated action in the history of the UnitedNations. While it is clear that the implementation of theInitiative will be led at the country level by Governments the United Nations agencies will hold themselves mutuallyaccountable for achieving this Initiative’s goals.The United Nations  in cooperation with the BrettonWoods institutions  other bodies of the United Nationssystem  including its specialized agencies  and the WorldTrade Organization  has a key role in fostering greatercoherence  complementarity and coordination in globaleconomic policy-making. The General Assembly shouldexert greater policy leadership on development issuesinasmuch as the Charter of the United Nations provides theAssembly with broad mandates concerning these issues. Inaccordance with relevant provisions of the Charter  theEconomic and Social Council must continue to strengthenits role as the central mechanism for coordinating thepolicies and activities of the United Nations  its specializedagencies and funds in the economic  social and relatedfields. It should provide overall guidance and coordinationto the United Nations development system. The Councilmust also promote a coordinated follow-up to the outcomesof major international conferences.Recommendations adopted by the Economic andSocial Council at its 1996 substantive session onstrengthening collaboration between the United Nations andBretton Woods institutions and on new arrangements forconsultations with non-governmental organizationsrepresented a great step forward.Modern democracy is the political counterpart of themarket economic system  and the two go hand in hand.The success of a democracy requires informed and civildiscourse and respect for the rule of law and thedemocratic process  including the expression of the publicwill through free and fair elections.The recent  vigorously contested presidential electionsignalled the vitality of the democratic process inArmenia. President Levon Ter-Petrossian’s re-electiondemonstrates the will of the people in support of thepolicies pursued thus far by the Government  based on aclear programme and an achievable plan of development.Development cannot be attained in the absence ofrespect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms.Armenia strongly supports the High Commissioner forHuman Rights in his efforts to restructure the Centre forHuman Rights. The Member States must continueworking towards better coordination within the Centre andconsolidation of human-rights functions within the UnitedNations system.Armenia considers self-determination in its multitudeof manifestations to be an inalienable human right. In thislight  the Nagorny Karabakh conflict continues to concernthe Government of Armenia and its peaceful resolutionremains Armenia’s top foreign-policy priority. A fewmonths ago  on 12 May  we marked the secondanniversary of the cease-fire in the Nagorny Karabakhconflict. At the same time  the parties to the conflictreleased all prisoners of war and hostages identified bythe International Committee of the Red Cross. Weconsider these developments encouraging and conduciveto the overall peace process and to the establishment of afavourable atmosphere for negotiations.Negotiations among the parties within theOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe(OSCE) Minsk Group on a political agreement continuedduring the past year. We believe that the signing of theagreement provides the best hope for consolidating thecease-fire and making the peace process irreversible. Theelements of the political agreement  and most importantlythe security provisions for Nagorny Karabakh  willeventually comprise an inseparable part of any settlement regardless of the ultimate status of Nagorny Karabakh.Also this year  the parties took an extra step toestablish a second negotiating track through immediateand direct contacts  as mandated by the December 1995meeting of the OSCE Council of Ministers in Budapest.6Thus far  several rounds of talks have taken place betweenArmenia and Azerbaijan in which general aspects of keyissues have been discussed. We are hopeful that therepresentative of Nagorny Karabakh will join in upcomingrounds  for we strongly believe that no final solution can beachieved without Karabakh’s direct participation in thedeliberations.The peaceful resolution of the Karabakh conflictremains Armenia’s first priority. Armenia is committed tothe talks on both tracks and will remain constructivelyengaged in both processes. We believe that these two trackscompliment each other and that any progress we make oneither can only positively impact the other  ultimatelyleading to a breakthrough.During the past five years  Armenia has experiencedfirst hand how war  armed conflict and regional instabilityin general can hamper economic progress and development.Thus  I would like to reiterate Armenia’s commitment tomaintaining the existing cease-fire  while eagerly searchingfor a solution based on good will  mutual compromise andunderstanding.The proliferation of weapons of mass destructionposes a serious threat to both global and regional securityand stability. The adoption last month by the GeneralAssembly of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treatyrepresented the international community’s determination tobring to a completion one of the most sought after non-proliferation and disarmament measures in the history ofthis Organization. It gave me much satisfaction to sign theTreaty earlier today on behalf of the Government andpeople of Armenia.Virtually all States Members of the United Nationsfavour an increase in the membership of the SecurityCouncil  reflecting the radical changes in the world and theincrease in the Organization’s overall membership.However  during the discussions in the Open-endedWorking Group  wide support has been expressed for theview that  if there is no agreement on other categories ofmembership  expansion should take place  for the timebeing  in the non-permanent category alone. Armeniafavours an increase in the non-permanent membership ofthe Council that would incorporate the interests of all theregional Groups and correspond to the principle of equitablegeographic distribution.In order to carry out its activities  the United Nationsneeds financial means. The financing of the Organization isthe collective responsibility of all Member States andArmenia is not indifferent to the financial situation of theUnited Nations.I would like to assure the Assembly that Armeniawill do its best to fulfil its financial obligations. However there is an urgent need to adopt a global package ofmeasures to solve the grave financial situation of theUnited Nations. These measures should contemplate inter alia  review of the scale of assessments so that itwould reflect as accurately as possible the principle ofcapacity to pay.Allow me to conclude by wishing the GeneralAssembly every success in the demanding work it facesduring this session  and by pledging Armenia’s mostactive and effective cooperation with the delegations ofother States."
"8",285,"ATG",51,1996,"﻿It is with profoundpleasure that I salute the President  a diplomat ofexperience and stature and one worthy to preside over thefunctions of the fifty-first session of the General Assembly.I wish to recall that it was his country and mine thatbrought the question of Antarctica to the United Nations and our countries have worked closely together for anumber of years. We have made progress as countries fromvarious parts of the world have joined us in an effort topreserve Antarctica as the last natural heritage of mankind.His country’s efforts in regard to the betterment of theglobal community are deeply admired by my countrymen and it is with a sense of genuine cordiality that we refer toMalaysia as a friendly and brotherly country. Permit mealso to extend sincere thanks to the outgoing President Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral of Portugal  who so ably ledthe historic fiftieth session of the General Assembly.On 7 July of this year Hurricane Bertha passedperilously close to Antigua and Barbuda  and our twin-island State sustained some damage. Small islanddeveloping States like ours are subject to various naturaldisasters — earthquakes  volcanic eruptions and hurricanes.In 1974  we experienced an earthquake that measured 7.8on the Richter scale and caused considerable destruction. Avolcano on the island of Montserrat  some 50 kilometresfrom our shores  has been active for the past 15 months.Our people live in constant fear of fall-out and tidal wavesfrom a major eruption.The natural phenomenon presently plaguing Montserratcould be a prelude to a disaster that can destroy smallislands globally. Evidence of the warming of the planet hasclearly emerged  and extreme weather events have becomemore frequent and intense. Last year  Hurricane Luisunleashed its fury on our country for 48 hours and wasdeclared to have been the worst storm of the century.Hurricane Marilyn followed in its wake  intensifying thedamage. Indeed  we remain grateful to the countries andinstitutions that provided various forms of assistance tohelp in the reconstruction.In addressing the General Assembly of theOrganization of American States this year  our envoynoted that development is not sustainable if a score ofstorms and hurricanes are to trample through our regioneach year. Carbon dioxide emissions caused by theburning of petroleum  coal  wood and gas since the startof the Industrial Revolution in western Europe 200 yearsago have begun to place the survival of small islands injeopardy. Harmful production  wasteful consumption anddangerous disposal patterns continue to characterize thebehaviour of the largest industrialized States. We musttherefore reduce carbon dioxide emissions to the agreedToronto targets. Together  let us address the challenge sothat we may bequeath to future generations a better anda safer world than we inherited. Our demise will onlysignal the beginning of the end of a marvellouscivilization  more creative and more inventive than anythat has gone before.Between 1 and 15 July Antigua and Barbuda playedits part at the human settlement Conference  Habitat II  atIstanbul  and we urge that the Istanbul Declaration andPlan of Action be adhered to. It must be recognized thatit is in the cities and towns of the new urban world where most of us will ultimately live and work  that mosteconomic activity will take place and goods be produced.It is where most pollution will be generated and nationalresources consumed  with an impact felt far beyond citylimits. Moreover  it will be in the cities and towns of thisurban world that growing social tensions and conflict rooted in poverty and the maldistribution of resources will be resolved  and where the key to true humansecurity will be found.The problems of urbanization are not limited to themore endowed countries. We too  despite our small size have to cope with the varying patterns and outcomes thatdemand responses that have at times threatened tooverwhelm us. Nevertheless  I am happy to report that inAntigua and Barbuda we have made considerable progresstowards control and adequate regulation.1Under the guidance of the Development ControlAuthority and the Central Housing and Planning Authoritymajor initiatives have been undertaken  with assistance fromthe United Nations Centre for Human Settlements and theUnited Nations Development Programme. The Government in partnership with other sectors of society  is playing amultiple role in improving living and working conditions onan equitable basis to enable all its citizens to enjoyadequate shelter  affordable basic services and sustainablehuman settlements.The Government of Antigua and Barbuda not onlyperforms the functions of a national policy-maker andhousing administrator  but also serves in the capacity oflender and developer. In those roles  it has ensured thatinterest rates are kept at reasonable levels and thatrepayment periods for loans are as long as 20 years. In itsregulatory role  the Government of the Labour Party has putforward development standards  stipulated buildingprocedures and integrated land and shelter policies withprogrammes for reducing poverty and assuring employment for environmental protection  for improvement in educationand health  and for providing clean water and sanitationfacilities.This is indeed a strange and puzzling world. Withreference to sustainable development  a myth has gatheredmomentum that maintains that the developing world ismaking significant forward strides. World Bank data however  demonstrate that over 60 per cent of the countriesin which the United Nations and other bodies havedevelopment assistance operations have witnessed declinesin real per capita income over the decade ending in 1994.James Gustave Speth  the Special Coordinator forEconomic and Social Development  in a forceful andmoving presentation at the opening of the 1996 substantivesession of the Economic and Social Council  noted twomajor ironies of the current situation. He declared that nowthat the world is freed from distorting effects ondevelopment cooperation  just when the developmentassistance community has learned so much more about howto succeed and do its job well  just when the needs of thedeveloping world are growing rapidly and dramatically —just at this precise time  the resources that are needed fordevelopment cooperation are shrinking rapidly anddramatically. In the past four years  real developmentassistance has declined by 20 to 25 per cent.The other irony is that just when there is a betterunderstanding of the essential links between peace anddevelopment cooperation  just when the United Nations iscalled upon to assume much greater responsibilities in thefollow-up to conferences and in post-conflict peace-building and other areas  just when the United Nations isreforming and strengthening itself to do these things  theOrganization finds itself threatened by a financial crisisthat afflicts both its assessed and its voluntarycontributions. Indeed  Speth sees the above as not onlyironies  but as tragedies of our era.This  the major international Organization  isrestructuring itself and endeavouring to undertakemeaningful reform. While it may be true that the existingfinancial crisis is primarily a crisis of payment  there isno denying the fact that there is unnecessary waste beinggenerated here  whether in regard to the duplication ofwork detail  the excessive copying of documents  thescheduling of numerous meetings destined to accomplishnothing or to a myriad of other undesirables. Financialconcerns are not  however  the only issue of which theworld body is seized. Reform is being undertaken in amulti-pronged manner  which in itself will be a longprocess that can be justified in a Benthamite way byemphasizing the greatest good for the greatest number.At present  even though the discussions have beenconsidered to have made progress  there is not even theglimmer of a discernible outcome in regard to the“Question of equitable representation on and increase inthe membership of the Security Council and relatedmatters”. Although consensus exists on expanding theCouncil  the manner in which that can be achievedequitably remains to be resolved. Antigua and Barbuda isfirm in its declared position that any expansion shouldinclude developing countries and that both the Africanand the Latin American and Caribbean Groups should berepresented. Similarly  Antigua and Barbuda would liketo see certain restrictions placed on the use of the veto.We understand that all efforts at restructuring and reformin the United Nations  however  should be focused oneconomic growth and development.In this whole process of misunderstandings  theregional commissions are being placed under attackthrough cut-backs and in some instances calls for theirdissolution. This is particularly hard on those of us whoare being served by the Economic Commission for LatinAmerica and the Caribbean (ECLAC). We see ECLAC asa regional organization that has already reformed itselfand should not be penalized by calls for further reforms.ECLAC has rendered valuable service throughsubprogrammes on economic development  socialdevelopment  international trade  development financing andtransport  industrial  agricultural  and technologicalmodernization  environment  natural resources and humansettlements  statistics and economic projections  theintegration of women into development  regional integrationand cooperation  economic and social planning andpopulation. In all of these fields  ECLAC collaborates withthe Governments of the Americas in the investigation andanalysis of public policy  provides technical assistance andtraining  and promotes regional cooperation.For those of us in the Caribbean it is imperative thatECLAC be fully sustained to continue to assist us in theseand other areas. This is set against the backdrop of thepressures that are being brought to bear on the Caribbeanregion  which Prime Minister Lester Bird described at themeeting of Heads of Government of the CaribbeanCommunity (CARICOM) on 6 July. He spoke of the right-wing voices that are ready to impose upon the States of theCaribbean Community a new colonialism under a variety ofguises  such as those of limited sovereignty andextraterritoriality. Indeed  the very economic survival ofsome Caribbean States is threatened as a result of pressuresbrought against countries whose sustenance depends almostentirely upon the production of a yellow fruit.Most of the countries affected by the banana disputeare former European colonies  and the continuation of theirhistoric access to European markets is crucial to theireconomic survival. Without some form of protection  thebanana industry in the CARICOM States would collapse leading to severe social dislocation that would ultimatelymanifest itself in political catastrophe.Recognizing the significance of banana production tosome of our economies  the European Union has aprogramme in which a small portion of its market isreserved for Caribbean producers  a portion that is less than10 per cent. This has certainly not been a major problemfor the big companies  for a handful of multinationalconcerns still controls 60 per cent of the European marketand 70 per cent of the overall market. However  it appearsthat Bob Herbert  in an editorial of 13 May  was correctwhen he asserted:“for the multinationals  enough is never enough”. (TheNew York Times  13 May 1996  Section A  p. 15)Indeed  for countries where literacy rates are in theninetieth percentile and where political prisoners areunheard of  it would be disastrous if the economies oftheir societies were to be destroyed through thedestruction of the banana industry.The bleakness of the aforementioned situation is however  offset by the ideas expressed at the TokyoConference on Development Strategy in March of thisyear  where it was posited that there is the will to sustaina new global partnership and make it effective. There wasconsensus that the issues that stretched beyondmathematical economics  that is  issues such as thoseincorporating poverty  the environment  the advancementof women and food security  had to be tackled at both thenational and international levels.It was nonetheless brought out that many developedcountries are experiencing harsh financial difficulties thatare imposing severe limits on their capacity to contributeto the international organizations. Thus  the nations of theworld had first to respond to the challenge of poverty bystriving for its eradication. Secondly  the key to successclearly lies in nations working together to build andimplement a development strategy to meet the challengesof the twenty-first century. Thirdly  in the process ofworking out and implementing a new developmentstrategy  it is crucially important to reinvigorate the rolesof the international organizations  and in particular that ofthe United Nations.Of significant concern to developing countries wasthe statement that in efforts to secure sufficient resourcesit is important to take steps in other policy areas such astrade or technological transfer. In addition  theglobalization of the world economy makes it important topromote the development of human resources and thecapacity for institution-building in developing countries.In its Human Development Report 1996  the UnitedNations Development Programme acknowledged that although some countries are experiencing unprecedentedeconomic growth  the quality of human development doesnot always reflect that progress. While many countries ofthe developing world are struggling with the implicationsof trade liberalization and globalization  individuals withinthese societies are faced with a complementary struggle.The sad fact is that as long as selective liberalizationbetween countries remains  individuals within countrieswill find it more difficult to escape the downward spiralinto the depths of poverty. It hardly takes a stretch of theimagination to recognize  therefore  that an earlyinvestment in building human capacity is incumbent upon3any society wishing to achieve economic and socialdevelopment that is both equitable and sustainable.While it can truly be said that the 1990s signalled theend of the cold war and witnessed the dissolution of abipolar world  the conflicts we are witnessing today arelocalized and appear to be gathering momentum as a resultof ethnic  religious and civil considerations. There is clearlyan upsurge of micronationalism  which fosters separatistconsiderations. There is much social disruption  massstarvation and the spread of contagious diseases. Of anextremely frightening nature is the fact that access tovictims is often rendered difficult or impossible. There isclearly a deepening lack of security for relief personnel andsupplies. Clearly  there is a need for the demobilization ofparamilitary groups  for demining and for an intensificationof peacemaking  peacekeeping and peace-building.It must be recalled that the United Nations came intoexistence to ensure peace among nations. With that in mind we should be prepared to take steps beyond a Non-Proliferation Treaty and a Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-BanTreaty and move towards the elimination of weapons ofmass destruction within a time-bound framework.Responses to the myriad of desperate problems haveto be interdisciplinary in nature  for there is no singleUnited Nations agency that can control  pacify  andrehabilitate effectively.Recognizing the dangers of increased internationalcriminal activity in the region  Antigua and Barbuda isworking with its neighbours and expects to receiveadditional assistance from bilateral and multilateral sourcesto initiate a national drug and money-laundering controlpolicy. Priorities of the policy include legislative andregulatory reform  increased interdiction activities  technicaltraining  preventive health and public education andtraining. Given its multidimensional nature  the drugproblem is one that the United Nations system isparticularly well equipped to address.However  working alone  the Organization is helplessto tackle this scourge that cuts across all sectors of society impacting on families  health and economic activity. Thereneeds to be greater coordination among nations if the blightof narcotics is to be tackled in a meaningful way. Strongand determined efforts within certain countries will beseriously undermined if there is not a united globalapproach to manifestations and practices that will destroynot only the fabric of our societies but the lives ofcountless individuals.The plague of terrorism must be controlled. Theappeals of two South Asian nations to have aninternational convention against terrorism must be heeded.Often  terrorism is linked to narcotics. Not only do theStates of the eastern Caribbean have fears of subversion they are also concerned by the intense violations of portsand harbours and the corresponding graft as theircountries serve as transit points.In concluding  I would like to say that as therepresentatives of the global community we have to liveup to the trust placed in us by our constituencies.Multilateralism must be paramount as we strive towardways and means for better management of our planet. Wemust agree on common values for common survival. Ourconstituents are calling for an end to senseless violenceand for the re-emergence of concepts of compassion andequity. They are asking for our dialogue to be creativeand forward-looking.The peoples of different regions must be prepared tomake sacrifices and to suppress the barriers that divide —barriers such as hatred  selfishness and bitterness. Let usnot forget the words of Philip Vundla  an executive of theAfrican National Congress  who said:“What you achieve by violence  you will needgreater violence to maintain. Those who say theanswer is bloodshed have other people’s blood inmind  not their own.”However  the fundamental need in regard toadvancement remains that of economic reality. MichelCamdessus of the International Monetary Fund remindedthe leaders of the G-7 countries on 24 June that:“Too many refusals to grant development assistancehave the alibi that such funds are wasted. Thisslippage  as well as the so-called donor fatigue  mustbe vigorously combated if the internationalcommunity wishes to be in a position to keep thepoorest countries from marginalization and to steerthe world away from the tensions and crises thatextreme poverty cannot but engender whenever itoccurs. Marginalization is not inevitable  and everycountry has its opportunity in this globalized world.”4My country recognizes the fact that we are in an eraof unprecedented change and opportunity  a period in whichscientific developments and technological achievementsseem almost miraculous and offer an improved quality oflife. The United Nations should become embedded inreality and push the critical issues involving destitution andsocial injustice to the centre of both national and publicdebate.Antigua and Barbuda takes pride in and cherishes theUnited Nations and we believe that it has been judged unjustly  more by its failures than by its successes. But thework done in regard to health  human rights  peacekeepingactivities  disaster mitigation and assistance to developingcountries presents an enviable record.The United Nations has the capacity for achievementsin areas beyond the reach of national or regional authorities.Subsequently  the nations that comprise this body mustredouble their collective commitment to translating visioninto reality. In this way  we will thrust the United Nationsmanfully forward into the dawning twenty-first century."
"9",332,"AUS",51,1996,"﻿I should like to extendwarm congratulations to Mr. Razali on his election asPresident of the General Assembly. As a close neighbourof Malaysia  Australia will confidently rely on hisexperience and sound judgement as he presides over thisimportant session of the Assembly.I feel greatly honoured to be leading for the firsttime the Australian delegation to a session of the GeneralAssembly.A year ago  when the Assembly adopted theDeclaration on the Occasion of the Fiftieth Anniversaryof the United Nations  it made an important promise: togive to the twenty-first century a United Nations thatwould serve effectively the peoples in whose name it wasestablished. We must keep that promise  but to do so we8will need a clear view of contemporary circumstances andof those which we can see unfolding into the twenty-firstcentury.The landscape that was revealed at the end of the coldwar  just a little over five years ago  has many newfeatures  some of which are still not clear. What is clear however  is that we face new challenges and that we havenew opportunities that few of us would have imagined fiveyears ago.The most compelling of these opportunities is to takefuture steps in nuclear-arms control and disarmament. Thepossibility of taking such steps is surely a principaloutcome of the end of the cold war. This was firmlyunderlined last Tuesday when  in a single day  67 countriessigned the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. Thatnumber  only a week later  is now nearly 100. But beyondthis achievement lies another major opportunity  which isto turn our national and international attention to enhancinghuman security in all its aspects.Our dynamic times have presented us with newproblems. Such problems include the major non-militarythreats to security: the clandestine arms trade  the narcoticstrade  HIV/AIDS  the need to stabilize the rate of growth ofthe world’s population and major threats to theenvironment.The elemental characteristics of such non-militarythreats to security are that they cannot be defeated byweapons. They cross state boundaries and they can affectwhole populations. These characteristics lead to one centralconclusion  that is  action on these problems must be thesubject of international cooperation.Multilateral cooperation can  does and must take manyforms. But the role of the United Nations is unique becauseof its universality and because of the rules we find in theCharter of the United Nations.It is for these reasons — the nature of theopportunities we have before us  the problems we face andthe unique role and capability of the United Nations — thatwe must keep last year’s promise of a United Nations fitfor the challenges of the twenty-first century.Australia’s particular commitment to the UnitedNations is founded on the belief  articulated as far back asthe 1950s by the then Foreign Minister  Richard Casey  thatthe United Nations represents the practical effort of theGovernments and peoples of the world to attain the highgoals to which they are pledged through the UnitedNations Charter: international peace and security and theeconomic and social advancement of all peoples.Australia has contributed readily to achieving thosegoals. Whether by paying its financial contributions in fulland on time  by providing personnel to peacekeepingoperations or through its contributions to developmentprogrammes  Australia has been determined to see theUnited Nations succeed. I commit Australia today tocontinuing such involvement in the work of the UnitedNations.At present  a window of opportunity in arms controland disarmament is open to us. If we do not take it soon it will close. Large and sophisticated nuclear andconventional arsenals continue to exist. In a number ofregions  suspicions remain close to the surface. The risksof the spread of weapons of mass destruction have  incertain respects  increased.In Australia’s view  two tasks are fundamental: first building and strengthening international institutions andinstruments; and secondly  developing new thinking inarms control and disarmament so as to push theinternational agenda forward in constructive and realisticways.To achieve progress with institutions andinstruments  Members of the United Nations need to worktogether on at least six priorities. These priorities forinternational cooperation are to make the Treaty on theNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and its enhancedreview process operate more effectively; to strengthen theInternational Atomic Energy Agency safeguards; toachieve an early start for the Organization for theProhibition of Chemical Weapons; to reach earlyagreement on effective verification machinery for theBiological Weapons Convention; to pursue the goal of aglobal ban on anti-personnel landmines in conjunctionwith a global approach to the problem of demining; andto achieve a ban on the production of fissile materials fornuclear weapons.As we pursue these priorities in the multilateralsystem  we should keep firmly in mind that progress inregional security  particularly in regions of weapons-proliferation concern  will make a crucial contribution.The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty is ofcourse the immediate priority. Its adoption by the GeneralAssembly and its opening for signature on 24 September9were major milestones for the international community. TheTreaty is a product of our times. It flows from a long andcommonly held global concern. Its death was something theinternational community simply could not allow.Australia was therefore prepared to take the lead inbringing the Treaty to the General Assembly. Theoverwhelming support for the resolution demonstrated thestrength of international feeling against nuclear testing. ThisTreaty was wanted and needed  but it has also helpedchange the international climate. We can now reasonablyhope and expect that nuclear testing will not be part of thefuture to be faced by succeeding generations. In a worldwith a mixed history on controlling the development andspread of destructive weaponry  that is something of whichwe can all be proud.The Treaty must become universal. We urge all thosecountries that have not yet done so to sign and ratify theTreaty as soon as possible so that it can be fullyimplemented as quickly as possible. There is no merit inthe argument that says that  because there is more to bedone in nuclear-arms control and disarmament  we shouldin some way scorn or reject a Treaty that bans all nuclearexplosions forever. This ban has intrinsic value. We mustnow keep up the positive momentum generated by theadoption of the Treaty.This brings me to the second task: developing newideas. Because building institutions and strengtheninginternational instruments will not be enough  theinternational community must also develop imaginative newways of guiding the world into the next century.The Australian Government established the CanberraCommission on the Elimination of Nuclear Weapons toaddress the questions of whether a nuclear-weapon-freeworld is feasible and  if so  the measures which could betaken to attain that objective. I am delighted to confirm thatthe Commission has more than met Australia’sexpectations. Its report will make a major contribution tointernational thinking and discussion on nucleardisarmament. The Australian Government will take itforward by circulating it today in this Hall  will present itto the Secretary-General tomorrow and introduce it to theConference on Disarmament in January.The Canberra Commission report recommends apolitical commitment by the nuclear-weapon States to theelimination of nuclear weapons. That is the first and centralrequirement. The report then sets out six immediate steps:taking nuclear forces off alert; removal of warheads fromdelivery vehicles; ending the deployment of non-strategicnuclear weapons; ending nuclear testing; initiatingnegotiations further to reduce United States and Russiannuclear arsenals; and an agreement among the nuclear-weapon States on reciprocal no-first-use undertakings andof a non-use undertaking by them in relation to thenon-nuclear-weapon States.The Commission also recommends three reinforcingsteps: action to prevent further horizontal proliferation;developing verification arrangements for a nuclear-weapon-free world; and the cessation of the production offissile material for nuclear-explosive purposes. TheCommission placed particular emphasis on the importanceof effective verification in the achievement andmaintenance of a nuclear-weapons-free world.Having at last  after 33 years  met the challenge ofthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty  theinternational community must now push on with furtherpractical and realistic measures on nuclear-arms controland disarmament.As already indicated  one such measure is thenegotiation of a convention under which it would beagreed that there will be no further manufacturing ofweapons-grade fissile material. This convention should besought now.Any discussion of arms control and disarmament intoday’s world that failed to address the question oflandmines would be sadly incomplete. These hideous anddiabolically inexpensive weapons must be banned.Australia will support efforts that will be made at thissession of the Assembly to take the next step towards thenegotiation of an international convention to that effect.But in the meantime  there are in excess of 100million of these maiming weapons distributed in the soilof too many countries. Demining must proceed at a farfaster rate than has been the case in the past. There havebeen technological barriers to increasing that rate andAustralia has therefore proposed that a technologyworking group be established among interested andcapable countries with the purpose of designing theequipment required for demining on a far larger andquicker scale.If there is any doubt about the need for this action I would place on record here that  if the current rate ofdemining in Cambodia were to be maintained  thatcountry  which has struggled so hard to repair itself 10would not be free of these mines for a further 130 years.This must be unacceptable to all. That is why theAustralian Government recently committed $12 million topractical demining initiatives in the war-ravaged fieldswithin our own region.Security Council reform is another vitally importantitem on the peace-and-security agenda. The three key issuesto be tackled are expansion  transparency and theeffectiveness of sanctions regimes.There is now a general acceptance that the SecurityCouncil must be expanded and modernized if it is tomanage international peace and security more effectively.Although Australia wants to avoid making the Council toounwieldy  there can be little doubt that its membershipneeds to reflect better current geopolitical and economiccircumstances. Expanding the membership is an importantelement in achieving this and Australia believes that anexpansion up to a total Council membership of 25 Stateswould be reasonable.This brings me to the more contentious point ofpermanent as against non-permanent membership. Australiahas made clear that it supports the claims of Japan andGermany to permanent membership. This is the very leastthe United Nations can do to acknowledge their major-Power status and the financial contribution they are makingto the Organization.Australia also advocates permanent seats on theCouncil for underrepresented regions. As to how that is tobe achieved  we remain flexible. Whether those seats arefilled by a single member or rotate among leading MemberStates agreed on by regional groupings needs to bediscussed further  primarily by those regions concerned. Wealso see scope for an increase in the number ofnon-permanent members of the Council  again in theinterests of ensuring greater balance in representation.I turn now to the need for greater transparency inSecurity Council processes. Consultative mechanisms haveimproved in recent times  notably between the Secretariatand troop-contributing countries  but more needs to bedone. Australia is committed to trying to improve the wayin which the Security Council interacts with non-membersso that the Council’s activities become more responsive tothe United Nations as a whole.More needs to be done  too  to build the Council’srelationship with regional organizations. Good progress hasbeen recorded to date  but United Nations and regionalorganizations should meet regularly in order to developfurther the appropriate division of responsibilities.The Council also has an important role to play inpreventing the proliferation of weapons of massdestruction and enhancing the effectiveness of thenon-proliferation regime.Australia wants to see improvements in theeffectiveness of United Nations sanctions because werecognize that the Security Council’s use of collectivesanctions continues to be an important and  at times contentious enforcement measure. The effectiveness ofsanctions regimes could be improved in three ways:clearer drafting of Security Council resolutions; providingspecific objectives and realistic time-frames; and throughrelevant sanctions committees providing clearinterpretative guidance on implementation. These arechanges that are essential for the Security Council’sdynamism. We need to press ahead with them to ensurethat the Council reflects modern-day circumstances andrealities.Our contemporary circumstances have opened upnew needs and prospects for peacekeeping and preventivediplomacy. Initial post-cold-war hopes about thecapabilities of the Security Council have been tempered.It has become clear that many conflicts are intractable.Experience has taught us that it is difficult to reachagreement on suitable approaches and to find enoughresources  particularly in the area of peacekeeping.The Security Council must be realistic in theimplementation of its Charter responsibilities. It mustresist pressure to embark on missions before it hascompleted adequate preparations  developed a focusedsense of the mission’s goals and agreed on a clearlyarticulated mandate.At this very moment  the United Nations isconfronted with major challenges in such diversesituations as those in Cyprus  Burundi and Liberia.Australia has been contributing personnel to the UnitedNations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus  for example  forover 20 years and has been saddened by the recentincidents of violence there. The time has come to resolvethat situation  which requires the assistance of all parties.One very important area of reform for UnitedNations peacekeeping is to establish an enhanced rapid-reaction capability. There have been many proposals onthis issue  but the Australian Government believes that the11Canadian study  Towards a Rapid Reaction Capability forthe United Nations  contains some commendablerecommendations  including the development of adeployable  operational-level headquarters to strengthenplanning for operations.Australia welcomes recent moves by the Departmentof Peacekeeping Operations to begin implementingmeasures aimed at improving United Nations rapid-reactioncapability  but in taking these measures forward  the UnitedNations should consult adequately with all Member States.Australia is also keen to see the United Nationsdevelop the preventive-diplomacy agenda and it welcomesthe greater resources the Secretariat now devotes to suchactivity. The Security Council  the General Assembly andthe good offices of the Secretary-General  as well asregional arrangements and agencies  have important roles toplay in preventive diplomacy. Australia supports greater useof Chapter VI of the Charter on the pacific settlement ofdisputes. Article 33 is particularly important. The SecurityCouncil can use it to undertake a leadership role by callingon disputing parties to seek a solution using negotiation mediation and other peaceful means.As I indicated at the beginning of this statement  oneof the chief results of the end of the cold war must surelybe an increase in our ability to turn away from militaryconcerns and to give a greater degree of attention to threatsto the security of individuals  as distinct from those threatsto the security of States that have dominated our thinkingin the past  important and basic though they have been andremain.In today’s world and in the world we see unfoldinginto the twenty-first century  the security of far too manypeople is threatened in ways no less immediate than thethreat of the gun. I have in mind narcotics  HIV/AIDS andmajor threats to the environment. These threats cannot bedealt with effectively by States acting alone. Sometimesthey require new international law  but more specificallythey require political will to defeat them and to fostercooperation among nations to ensure maximumeffectiveness of action.The United Nations is the ideal environment in whichto develop such cooperation. It is here that the world isrepresented. We have here a tradition of debate  ofdiscussion  of identification of problems and of consensus.We have the ability to make law when it is necessary.Above all  we have pledged ourselves to defending andproviding a decent standard of living to the peoples werepresent.There is also a regional role and  in that context Australia was pleased to have promoted the concept of aregional HIV/AIDS ministers’ meeting at the Post-Ministerial Conference of this year’s session of theAssociation of South-East Asian Nations.As we move towards the twenty-first century  it willbe crucial to the execution of that responsibility to ensurethat we have a healthy United Nations that is devoted tointernational cooperation aimed at defeating the majornon-military threats to the security of the human family.These threats are tragically evident to us today. They willonly become larger if we do not agree  now  to begincooperative action to defeat them. History will surelyjudge our generation harshly if  having identified theproblems of human security  we fail for lack of will toaddress their solutions.Another great requirement of our times is theeconomic needs of people and the promotion ofdevelopment. Much has been done through the UnitedNations and its agencies to advance the developmentcause. They have been pivotal to the emergence of amultilateral approach in which institutions with specialcompetencies such as the specialized agencies  theInternational Monetary Fund and the World Bank together with policy deliberative bodies such as theGeneral Assembly and the Economic and Social Council have complementary roles to play.Development is about more than just economicgrowth  however. There is also the need for internalstability  sound environmental management  a vigorouscivil society and a lively democracy. The United Nationsis uniquely placed to build consensus on how to advancethese various elements of the development agenda.In this context  Australia welcomes the constructiveoutcomes achieved at the ninth session of the UnitedNations Conference on Trade and Development(UNCTAD) held in Midrand  South Africa  earlier thisyear. The decisions taken there should help developingcountries benefit from the opportunities of economicglobalization.We also underline the importance of encouraginginvestment and technology transfers and providing tradeopportunities to stimulate economic development. Such1development is the only enduring foundation forindependence and economic and social well-being.It is in Africa that these development challenges aremost stark. Rich in promise yet wearied by emergencies Africa stands today at a decisive juncture in its history.African leaders seized the moment with theOrganization of African Unity’s 1995 Cairo Agenda forAction  in which they called for immediate action toimplement the development strategies for which aninternational consensus now exists. The United Nationsresponded this year with the launch of a 10-year $25 billion United Nations System-wide Special Initiativefor Africa.The Australian Government welcomes the SpecialInitiative as a concrete demonstration of the internationalcommunity’s concern with Africa. The internationalcommunity cannot allow disease  poverty  war andunderdevelopment to become entrenched in the 53nations — almost one-third of United Nations MemberStates — that make up the African continent.The world must continue to seek ways to break thepoverty cycle in Africa so that its potential for economicdevelopment is realized. Sustainable economic developmentis essential to overcome poverty  disease and conflict.The United Nations system needs to give greater focusand impetus to the development effort in Africa.I now turn to the issue of human rights. Human rightsare important in international relations for two mainreasons: first  political instability and major conflict canresult where human rights are breached or are under threat;and secondly  the freedom and dignity of individuals is  initself  of fundamental value to the world community.The Australian Government aims for practicaloutcomes that will improve the lives of individual men women and children. We recognize the importance ofdialogue and cooperation  based on mutual respect. Inaddition to public and private diplomacy  Australia’sapproach to the improvement of human rights alsoencompasses development cooperation.Australia strongly supports the development of strongand independent national human rights institutions. Forexample  Australia provided financial support for aworkshop of Asia-Pacific national human rights institutions which agreed to establish an informal forum to work for thestrengthening and further development of such institutionsin the region. Australia has also provided financialsupport to the United Nations for the creation of aposition of special adviser to the United Nations HighCommissioner for Human Rights on national humanrights institutions.Finally  it is important to address the issue of reformof the United Nations. Much work still needs to be doneto bring about greater efficiency and effectiveness in theUnited Nations and its specialized agencies.While Australia applauds the dedication and hardwork of the General Assembly Working Groups that wereset up in 1995  Member States must not lose sight of thefact that to achieve real change  the Groups have to comeup with realistic and achievable recommendations. Thoserecommendations must in turn lead to practical andmeasurable outcomes.It is important that the work of the groups befocused and that their momentum be restored so that earlyand positive outcomes can be achieved. We must allcommit ourselves to this end and to bringing aboutstructured change within the United Nations.It is also crucial that the financial situation of theUnited Nations be repaired. Australia believes that allMembers should pay their contributions in full and ontime. We therefore welcome recent moves by somecountries to pay their arrears.It is time to establish a revised scale of assessedcontributions that more fairly reflects what Governmentscan pay. The current minimum payment is too high formany small-economy countries  and Australia would liketo see it reduced or even removed.These are the reforms that Australia believes arenecessary to equip the United Nations for its role in thetwenty-first century.It is in this overall context that Australia is deeplycommitted to contributing to the United Nations goal ofmaintaining international peace and security in an activeway. Serving a term as a non-permanent member of theSecurity Council during 1997-1998 would enableAustralia to make a substantive contribution to that goaland to work for a more effective  modernized andtransparent Council. That is why we have asked for thesupport of Member States at the elections to be held afew weeks from now.13Let me conclude by summing up what I have saidtoday. The United Nations is unique and needed  but itmust pursue  and work on the basis of  a relevant Agenda.This is the central point. The United Nations must be putto work on the agenda of the twenty-first century.Much work needs to be done to tackle the keychallenges that face the United Nations. Only a sustained cooperative effort among all Member States will bringsuccess. Australia will make that effort."
"10",379,"AUT",51,1996,"﻿We are glad to see theGeneral Assembly  the key organ in the reform process ofthe Organization  meet under a President who combinesprofound knowledge of the United Nations with areputation for strong leadership.My colleague from Ireland has already outlined thepositions of the European Union  which we fully endorse.I will elaborate on a few points to which Austria attachesparticular importance.When discussing the need for reform a year ago Heads of State and Government expressed their politicalwill to give the twenty-first century a United Nationsequipped  financed and structured to serve effectively thepeoples in whose name it was established. However insufficient progress has been made so far in implementingthis commitment. While the Secretary-General  to whosespirited leadership of the Organization I should like to paya warm personal tribute  has undertaken a number ofimportant reform initiatives  the Working Groups of theGeneral Assembly have made only limited progress. Muchmore needs to be done. And we must always bear in mindthat reform is not mere downsizing  but pursuing our goalseffectively and efficiently. Four principles should  in ourview  guide our reform agenda. As the first priority and asa precondition for reform  we must fulfil our financialobligations in accordance with the United Nations Charter;we must give clear mandates and provide the necessaryresources; we must ensure the competitiveness of theUnited Nations system; and we must eliminate duplication waste and mismanagement.We should like to see strong United Nations leadershipin the following areas.As regards human rights  the results of the WorldConference on Human Rights form an integral part of thecoordinated follow-up to recent United Nations conferences.Austria will play an active role in preparations for thefiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration ofHuman Rights and the five-year review of the ViennaDeclaration and Programme of Action in 1998. Today our main task is not to elaborate new internationalstandards in the field of human rights but to ensure fullrespect for the broad body of existing norms and rules inall parts of the world. This requires the activeinvolvement of the entire United Nations system. Thisincludes United Nations Development Programme(UNDP) projects on governance; the United NationsChildren’s Fund’s efforts in the field of juvenile justice;programmes of the Crime Prevention and Criminal JusticeBranch of the Secretariat for the strengthening of criminaljustice systems; and the integration of human rightselements into United Nations field missions. In the run-upto 1998  system-wide cooperation and integration in thefield of human rights have to be improved.Austria pays particular attention to the promotionand protection of minorities as a means both to preventand to resolve conflicts. Respecting the rights ofminorities is crucial for peaceful development and goodneighbourly relations. The case of South Tyrol is anexcellent example. Half a century after the conclusion ofthe 1946 Treaty of Paris between Austria and Italy — offundamental importance for the survival of the Austrianminority — the South Tyroleans enjoy the protection ofa carefully regulated autonomy  which increasingly servesas an inspiration in comparable situations elsewhere.Turning next to drug control and organized crime  itis estimated that drug sales generate more than$120 billion annually  thus exceeding the gross domesticproduct of many United Nations Member States. Thiseconomic power of drug traffickers is a serious threat tothe stability and the democratic and legal institutions ofmany countries. Drug abuse also has severe socialconsequences for societies and individuals. Therefore drug control must remain a top priority for the UnitedNations. Austria will welcome the holding of a specialsession of the General Assembly in 1998 devoted to thisquestion. In order to make that session a success  weshould soon start our preparations at the national  regionaland international levels.Trafficking in illicit drugs goes hand in hand withtransnational organized crime and money laundering which can be fought only through intensified internationalcooperation. In this regard  we encourage closercooperation between the United Nations International8Drug Control Programme and the Secretariat’s crimeDivision.I turn now to fight against the sexual exploitation ofchildren. A phenomenon closely linked to organized crimeis the sexual exploitation of children; this contemporaryform of slavery can result in serious  life-long  even life-threatening consequences for the physical  psychologicaland social development of children. The rights of childrenand women being at the very heart of our concern  wewould like in this respect to reiterate the importance weattach to the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action aswell as to the recommendations of the recent StockholmWorld Congress on Commercial Sexual Exploitation ofChildren. We are convinced that only a global partnershipuniting Governments  non-governmental organizations andrelevant United Nations agencies can bring an end to thetrafficking and exploitation of children and women forsexual purposes.Peace-keeping remains the international community'smajor tool to assist parties to a conflict in theimplementation of peace agreements or to provide a rapidresponse to complex emergencies. In view of lessonslearned from previous missions  we actively support theimprovement of the rapid deployment capability of theOrganization  including the establishment of a rapidlydeployable headquarters.Currently  some 1 200 Austrians — troop contingents military observers  civilian police and civilians — areserving in United Nations missions and in theImplementation Force (IFOR) in Bosnia and Herzegovina.We will continue to participate in such operations. In thiscontext  I am pleased to announce that my country willparticipate in the system of stand-by arrangements. We willalso continue to assist the United Nations in its efforts toimprove the quality of peace-keeping personnel through ourparticipation in the United Nations training assistance teamprogramme. International training centres in Austria offertraining programmes for military as well as civilianpersonnel. We have joined forces with the Organization ofAfrican Unity (OAU) in the strengthening of conflictprevention and peace-keeping capacities in Africa.As regards preventive diplomacy  over the last fewyears  we have witnessed an increase in the deployment ofsmall political field missions. They play an important rolein the preventive diplomacy efforts of the Secretary-Generaland his Special Representatives  and in the coordination ofpeace-building initiatives. Austria encourages the Secretary-General to make more use of this cost-effective instrument.We therefore support his proposal to establish clearbudgetary procedures ensuring a sound and predictablefinancial basis for such missions.The United Nations took the lead in developing theconcept of post-conflict peace-building. Today  not onlythe United Nations but also the International MonetaryFund (IMF) and the World Bank  the Organization forEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and theOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe(OSCE) are elaborating concepts of how to assist in theconsolidation of peace and the prevention of therecurrence of conflicts. The objective of peace-building ispolitical  but it often requires action in the economic social  humanitarian or human rights fields.The broad variety of available instruments is amplydemonstrated by a recent survey of the United Nationssystem’s capabilities in post-conflict reconstructioncompiled by the Vienna-based Reconstruction andDevelopment Support Unit of the Secretariat.The ability of the United Nations system to act in anintegrated manner in peace-building represents a test forits overall ability to reform and to modernize. We callupon the Secretary-General to develop comprehensivecriteria and operational guidelines  including on thequestion of leadership for peace-building activities. Wealso encourage the Secretary-General to intensify hiscooperation with international financial institutions andother relevant actors in this field.As regards regional conflicts  time constraintsprevent me from addressing in detail the many situationsin all parts of the world where the internationalcommunity  often under the leadership of the UnitedNations  has attempted to bring conflicts and humansuffering to an end — as in the Great Lakes region ofAfrica  Liberia and Afghanistan. I will limit myself to aconflict in our immediate neighbourhood  namely thesituation in the Balkans: in the former Yugoslavia.My country follows developments there with bothgreat hope and great concern. The implementation of theDayton Peace Agreement lags behind our expectations especially in the civilian field. However  we must notoverlook the foremost achievement of this Agreement: thefact that a very brutal and bloody war was stopped andthat the road for Bosnia and Herzegovina’s return tonormalcy was paved. It is an encouraging sign thatballots  and no longer bullets  are in place.9The elections held on 14 September represent a vitalstep forward and indicate the Bosnian people’sdetermination to continue with the peace process. Thesetting up of common institutions  as foreseen by theDayton Agreement  is now the number-one task.Notwithstanding the primary responsibility of the partiesthemselves to fully implement the Dayton peace accords  itis indispensable that the international community notabandon the country after the expiration of the IFORmandate by the end of this year. We will have to continueto assist the people and authorities of Bosnia andHerzegovina in their efforts to rebuild a civil society and tostrengthen reconciliation among ethnic groups.Sustainable management of environmental resources toensure both human progress and human survival poses amajor challenge at the outset of the twenty-first century. Atpresent  we are compromising the ability of futuregenerations to meet their own needs. The United Nationshas a crucial role to play in achieving a commonunderstanding of sustainability and in promoting itsimplementation. We therefore attach great importance tonext year’s special session of the General Assembly on theoverall review and appraisal of Agenda 21. The specialsession should not only assess the implementation of theRio commitments  but should also elaborate a globalconsensus on new important areas such as sustainableconsumption  production patterns  energy and transport.The process of globalization also profoundly changesthe parameters of social development in all countries. TheWorld Summit for Social Development took up thischallenge and agreed on a set of principles  goals andcommitments to enhance the benefits and mitigate thenegative effects of this process. We welcome thedetermination of the United Nations system to translate theoutcome of the Copenhagen Summit into its operationalwork for the benefit of all people.We are striving nationally to meet our commitmentseven in times of budgetary cuts. I avail myself of thisopportunity to recall the Austrian invitation to hold aregional follow-up conference to the social Summit inVienna at the end of 1997 or the beginning of 1998.My next point is disarmament. A more cooperativeapproach to security is to provide a setting conducive togiving new impetus to international disarmament and armscontrol. Serious efforts must be undertaken to eliminateweapons of mass destruction and to strengthen the variousarms control and non-proliferation regimes. At the sametime  more attention should be devoted to areas ofconventional disarmament  such as the United NationsRegister of Conventional Arms  small arms and armstransfers  as well as to the further development ofuniversal regimes of transparency in armaments. TheWassenaar Arrangement  recently established in Vienna will make an important contribution to international peaceand security.In response to the human tragedy of civilianlandmine victims  Austria has been one of the firstcountries to establish a total moratorium on anti-personnellandmines  and is aiming for an agreement on aworldwide total ban on this scourge of humanity.The approval of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) constitutes a milestone on our pathtowards a more secure future  leaving behind the nuclearweapons competition that defined the cold war. Austriawelcomes the test moratoriums announced by all fivedeclared nuclear-weapon States  and we call on all Statesto work on the rapid ratification of the CTBT in order tofoster nuclear non-proliferation and to spare this planetfurther ecological damage.The organization for the CTBT and  pending entryinto force  its preparatory commission  will play a vitalrole in verifying the implementation of the test ban.Austria considers it an honour to host such an importantinternational organization and will contribute its share tocreating favourable working conditions. The position ofVienna  which already hosts the International AtomicEnergy Agency (IAEA)  as the centre of global nuclearnon-proliferation is further strengthened by the addition ofcrucial nuclear verification facilities.This fight can be won only by pursuing a double-tracked approach: on one track  non-proliferation is aprecondition for ridding ourselves of the risk of nucleardestruction. On the other track  the nuclear-weapon Statesare called upon to honour their obligation under theTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons(NPT) to disarm their nuclear arsenals with the ultimategoal of the complete elimination of these weapons.The United Nations should continue to play aleading role in the progressive development ofinternational law. Austria highly esteems the work of theInternational Law Commission. Currently the elaborationof a statute for an international criminal court is of utmostimportance. Austria strongly supports the earlyestablishment of the court  to end the widespread cultureof impunity.10Finally  I would like to mention the United NationsOffice at Vienna: our strong commitment to the UnitedNations also manifests itself in Austria’s role as one of theheadquarters of the Organization. United Nationsprogrammes and agencies based in Vienna represent highlyimportant instruments in international efforts to meet newthreats to peace  security and development. I am referringto the key role of the International Atomic Energy Agencyin preventing nuclear proliferation; that of the UnitedNations International Drug Control Programme and theUnited Nations crime Division  which fight against drugabuse  money laundering  organized crime and corruption;of the Office for Outer Space Affairs  the principal UnitedNations body for international cooperation in the peacefuluses of outer space; of the United Nations IndustrialDevelopment Organization (UNIDO)  the centralcoordinating agency for information  analysis  advice andassistance in the field of sustainable industrial development;and of the United Nations Commission on InternationalTrade Law (UNCITRAL)  the international centre for thepromotion  harmonization and unification of the law ofinternational trade. We would like to pay tribute toUNCITRAL for the able manner in which it is carrying outits task. The Austrian Government is looking forward tocelebrating the Commission’s thirtieth anniversary on theoccasion of its next meeting  in spring 1997 in Vienna.Over the years  the IAEA and the United NationsOffice at Vienna have understood the importance ofbuilding a solid reputation for good and lean management.UNIDO has undergone drastic reforms  streamlining itssecretariat and clearly defining its priorities and areas ofconcern. As one of the host countries of the UnitedNations  we are particularly committed to the reform effortsbeing undertaken by these organizations and by the UnitedNations system as a whole. We shall support all efforts tofulfil the commitments we all agreed on last year  to makethe United Nations fit for the twenty-first century."
"11",404,"AZE",51,1996,"﻿I wish to make a statement on behalf of theMinister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Azerbaijan.At the outset  allow me to congratulate Mr. RazaliIsmail on his election to the high post of President of theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-first session  which atteststo the recognition of Malaysia’s authority in theinternational arena. I am confident that  under his ableguidance  the General Assembly will write anotherexemplary chapter in the annals of United Nations history.I also take this opportunity to extend our deepgratitude to the President of the last  historic fiftiethsession of the General Assembly  Mr. Diogo Freitas doAmaral  for the excellent manner in which he led thework of the Assembly.The Azerbaijani Republic attaches specialimportance to the creation of a new world order  basedprimarily on the strict observance by all States of thefundamental principles of international law and on thecomprehensive system of international security. Worldsecurity must take into consideration the interests of allsovereign States  irrespective of their size or population.No single State should ensure its own security at theexpense of another.In a transformed world in the late twentieth century the euphoria of post-bloc relations has begun to yield tothe sober realization that mankind is faced today withacute problems of an increasingly global nature. Theproliferation of weapons of mass destruction  aggressiveseparatism  international terrorism  drug trafficking andenvironmental pollution are common problems that mustbe resolved through joint efforts. In these conditions  theconsolidated action of Member States will permit aquicker identification of the real mechanisms needed toaddress these serious problems.Azerbaijan welcomes the adoption of theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty  recently openedfor signature. The objective achieved had been sought formany decades. It is a major contribution to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons  in particular  anddisarmament in general.10Taking into account the historical experience of theworld community and striving to attain the highest humanvalues  the Government of Azerbaijan  in the person ofPresident Heydar Aliyev  having unified the nation  isheading with determination along the path of democraticreform  since only a climate of peace and national accordbased on respect for civic rights and human liberties canensure the overall development of the individual and societyand create conditions conducive to normal interaction withthe world at large and the country’s achievement ofdemocratic political  economic and humanitarian standards.However  every aspect of life in my country has beenseriously affected by the aggression of the Republic ofArmenia. The occupation of about 20 per cent of theterritory of Azerbaijan and the seizure and plunder of townsand villages  including tens of thousands of objects takenfrom households  industry  agriculture  the infrastructureand the social sector  continue to inflict enormous damageon the Azerbaijani State. “Ethnic cleansing” has beencarried out in the occupied territories. The country faces anextremely serious humanitarian situation. The number ofrefugees and displaced persons has passed the one millionmark  a figure that is catastrophic for a country with a totalpopulation of 7.5 million.Still  we continue to consider peaceful negotiationswithin the framework of the Organization for Security andCooperation in Europe (OSCE) Minsk process to be theonly way to settle the conflict. It was for that reason thatAzerbaijan  despite the continuing occupation of its landsand the presence of enormous numbers of refugees anddisplaced persons  consented to the ceasefire which haslasted for more than two years.The Republic of Armenia  endeavouring to consolidatethe gains from its past aggression  refuses to recognizeAzerbaijan’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and therebyentirely discredits one of the fundamental principles ofinternational law as a basis for settlement. That refusal hasbecome a major obstacle to the achievement of peace.I would like to reconfirm our clear compromiseposition on the settlement  which envisages the assuranceof unconditional and immediate implementation of therelevant Security Council resolutions and OSCE decisionsregarding the conflict. The package of our proposals tospeed up progress in the Minsk process towards theachievement of a comprehensive settlement consists ofthese elements: the withdrawal of Armenian forces from alloccupied territories of Azerbaijan  including the Shusha andLachin districts; the return of the Azerbaijani population totheir previous places of residence  including the Nagorny-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan; ensuring equal security monitored by the OSCE forces  for the Armenian andAzerbaijani populations who have suffered as a result ofthe armed conflict; and guarantees that autonomy will begranted to the entire population of the region constitutingAzerbaijan.At their meeting on 22 April 1996 in Luxembourg held within the framework of the conclusion of bilateralagreements on partnership and cooperation betweenAzerbaijan  Georgia and Armenia and the EuropeanUnion  the Presidents of Azerbaijan and Armenia adopteda joint communiqué expressing their agreement that theresolution of the conflict will make a substantialcontribution to regional stability and security as well as tothe socio-economic development of the peoples of theregion.In reflecting on the establishment of a securitysystem at the regional and pan-European levels  we wouldlike to emphasize that in our view the forthcoming OSCESummit in Lisbon constitutes a real opportunity for theelaboration of basic principles for the settlement  not onlyfor the settlement  not only of the Armenian-Azerbaijaniconflict  but possibly also other conflicts in the OSCEarea. The relevant provisions of the Summit’s finaldocument  agreed at the highest level  could play a mostimportant role in the positive development of negotiationsboth within the OSCE Minsk process and in all othercurrent mediatory efforts of the OSCE.For several years since the end of the cold waractive discussions have been taking place in the world onthe transformation of international relations. Thesediscussions are held at different levels and touch uponalmost all aspects of life of the world community. TheUnited Nations  as the leading international organization is the main forum for gathering and testing a majority ofideas related to a vision and understanding of processestaking place in the world in recent years  and thepossibilities for their implementation in the name ofhuman progress.In recent years these have been wide discussions onan increase in the membership of the Security Council or in a broader context  on its reform in the light of thesubstantial increase in the membership of the UnitedNations and the major changes in international relations.In this regard  it is important to take into account theneed to maintain and even strengthen the ability of the11Security Council to respond adequately to threats ofinternational peace and security.Azerbaijan supports the candidatures of Germany andJapan as potential permanent members of the SecurityCouncil. At the same time  the question of equitablerepresentation of all regions among the permanent membersshould not disappear from the agenda. In this context  itshould be noted that many other ideas and proposals havebeen put forward  in particular by Italy and a number ofother States  which must be thoroughly studies.Azerbaijan fully supports the efforts undertaken by theinternational community in response to the alarmingincrease in terrorist acts in recent years. We unequivocallycondemn  as criminal and unjustifiable  all acts  methodsand practices of terrorism  wherever and by whomever theyare committed  including those that jeopardize friendlyrelations among States and peoples and threaten theterritorial integrity and security of States. Azerbaijansupports the establishment of a specialized internationalorganization to combat terrorism.Azerbaijan attaches crucial importance to the processof integration into the global economic system  andconsiders it one of the main requisites for the formation ofa multidimensional  dynamic market economy and an opendemocratic society. For this purpose legislation has beenadopted to strengthen market economy principles  notablythrough laws on private property  free enterprise  bankingactivities  foreign investment protection  and so on.Economic reform in Azerbaijan and the implementation ofeconomic projects are being carried out in activecollaboration with the Bretton Woods institutions. Concretemeasures have been worked out and are being implementedto shape State economic policy for the transitional period.They include the reform of the monetary and credit systemand the development of pricing and tax policies. A three-year programme to privatize State enterprises has beenlaunched. To achieve this goal Azerbaijan activelyencourages foreign investment  and has embarked on aconsistent course of liberalization of foreign economicactivity  the gradual elimination of non-tariff restrictions and encouragement of national exports.The Azerbaijan Republic agrees on the need for thestructural reform and financial normalization of the UnitedNations. In this regard  I would like once again to draw theGeneral Assembly’s attention to the problem of theassessment of fair contributions to the United Nationsbudget that will reflect the real capacity of States to pay.While we welcome the decision of principle to abolish thesystem of limits  we nevertheless consider that the long-windedness of this process is resulting in the deteriorationof the financial situation of the newly independent States including Azerbaijan  which is obliged  in order to clearits debts to the United Nations budget  to cut down on thealready very meagre programmes of social support for thepopulation  particularly refugees and displaced persons.The Government of Azerbaijan would also like todraw particular attention to the need for fairrepresentation of the new independent States within thestaff of the United Nations. While we are aware of thedifficulties the Organization is now experiencing  wecannot accept a situation in which Azerbaijan is still notrepresented in the secretariats of the United Nations andits specialized agencies.The economic reforms carried out in Azerbaijan areaimed largely at improving the social situation of thepopulation. However  the monthly income of aconsiderable portion of the population is below thesubsistence level  given the persisting economicdifficulties in a country with an economy in transition which have been aggravated by the burden of providingthe necessary assistance to the refugees and displacedpersons.In such a situation  great importance attaches tospecial humanitarian and other forms of assistance fromthe United Nations  its specialized agencies and donorcountries  including assistance for the rehabilitation andreconstruction of a number of regions of Azerbaijan thathave suffered as a result of military action. Whileexpressing the deep gratitude of the people of Azerbaijanfor the assistance provided  we appeal to donor countriesnot to reduce its scale.I am confident that the United Nations will continueto do its best to act as a catalyst in the achievement ofpeaceful coexistence among States  and to reinforce thenotion of the interdependence of national aspirations andthe common welfare of humanity  thus creating conditionsconducive to the political stability and sustainableeconomic development of States.The potential exists to reinforce and strengthen thework of the United Nations. We are increasinglywitnessing the expansion of the Organization’s sphere ofactivity  when it goes beyond the bounds of the traditionalconcept of maintenance of international peace andsecurity and tackles more diversified tasks. Activities suchas electoral assistance  the provision of special1humanitarian assistance  human rights monitoring assistance in nation-building and the creation of conditionsfor the sustainable development of States have begun to beassociated around the world with the United Nations today.In concluding  I should like to recall the well-knownmaxim: “The best world is a world that belongs to all  andit becomes possible only through the efforts of all.” So letus unite our efforts for the sake of building such a world."
"12",450,"BDI",51,1996,"﻿The Burundi delegation  which I have the honourof leading at the current session of this General Assembly would like to begin by taking this opportunity to present thefriendly greetings of the Government and people ofBurundi.Burundi attaches overwhelming importance to thenoble ideals of justice  peace and security which the UnitedNations has defended and pursued. This is why  evenduring the acute crisis that has rocked our country thesepast three years  we have always tried to participate asactively as possible in these proceedings. We offer well-deserved thanks for the Organization’s tireless efforts to putan end to the fratricidal war we have been experiencingsince 21 October 1993.Our delegation welcomes the fitting choice of aworthy son of Malaysia to act as President of the fifty-firstsession of the General Assembly of our Organization. Weare convinced that his intellectual and moral qualities together with his thorough knowledge of the concerns ofthe world today  are undeniable assets in ensuring thesuccess of our work.He can count on the full support and readiness of mycountry  which has a Vice-President on the Bureau  and wewill make our modest contribution to ensuring the successof the work of the President.We also wish to pay tribute to his predecessor His Excellency Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral of Portugal for the competence and clear-sightedness with which heconducted the proceedings of the previous session  whenthe United Nations was commemorating its fiftiethanniversary.Finally  we wish to express our appreciation for therole that His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali Secretary-General of the United Nations  has playedthroughout the world during his term of office to promotepeace  cooperation and development. We particularlyremember the important appeal for peace and nationalreconciliation he addressed to the people of Burundi andAfrica during his visit to Bujumbura in July 1995.Despite the crisis in my country  we believe that thismessage will finally be heeded by those who opted forviolence to satisfy their ambitions.As members know  the fifty-first session of theGeneral Assembly is taking place at a time when mycountry  Burundi  is suffering the deepest crisis of itshistory. The end of the cold war certainly made itpossible for the international community to free itselffrom the ideological shackles and other constraintsimposed on it by East-West antagonisms. The UnitedNations has thus been able to focus on its fundamentalobjectives and effectively respond to some of theproblems the rivalry between super-Powers had longmade it impossible to solve.However  we cannot but note  not without bitterness that in the post-cold-war period  new  more complexconflicts have broken out  mostly within countries  thathave caused serious humanitarian problems. That unfortunately  is the case in my country. For three years Burundi has been in the grip of widespread massacres andacts of genocide.Since October 1993  Burundi has been increasinglymired in a tragedy from which it seems unable to escape.The consensus Government established in October 1994in the context of implementation of the Convention onGovernance of 10 September 1994  after lengthynegotiations among political parties  has beencharacterized by suspicion and a lack of trust at thehighest echelons of State and a serious lack of will torestore peace.The complicity of the previous administration witharmed groups  massive human rights violations  duplicityat the top of the State administration and the absence ofleadership have led to denunciation of the Convention onGovernance and a breakdown in institutions. With a viewto avoiding implosion in the face of the threat of renewedgenocide  and lacking a credible alternative  the activeforces of the nation requested His Excellency PresidentBuyoya to take on the burden of responsibility of puttingBurundi back on track.The new administration has decided that its priorityis to put an end to massacres and slaughter  to restorepeace and security for all  to end impunity  to reintegratedisplaced persons and reconstruct the country.The government of public salvation was inauguratedon 2 August 1996. This is a broad-based team that3reflects the various ethnic components and political trends.All regions of the country have been represented.The Government wants to promote solidarity and unityto ensure the success of its transitional programme  whichwill last three years. Its plan of action was made publicrecently by the Prime Minister  His ExcellencyMr. Pascal Firmin Ndimira. Its aim is to make good thecommitment entered into by the Head of State to bringBurundi back to the path of peace  security and prosperityby means of dialogue and national debate.The changes in Burundi since 25 July 1996 have beenwelcomed by the population of Burundi as a rescueoperation. The messages of support from all quarters andthe spontaneous demonstrations throughout the countrywere visible signs of the support of the people of Burundifor the new administration  which has come to theassistance of a country that was on the brink.However  some countries  particularly our neighbours were slow to realize the need  if we were to avoid genocidein Burundi and maintain the sovereignty of the country  toestablish an administration that would bring people togetherin the quest for security  not of one ethnic group to thedetriment of others  but of all.This was therefore not an attempt to underminedemocracy  as some claim. The Government wants  instead to end the massacre of innocent populations battling withthe various armed factions within the country and outside from the capital to the heart of Burundi  to restore peaceand security for all and create conditions conducive tocomprehensive democratization based on national realities.The efforts being undertaken by the newadministration to restore peace and organize dialogue andnational debate have been hampered by the economicsanctions against Burundi. I am duty-bound to draw theattention of representatives here to the damaging effects ofthe economic blockade imposed on my country at theSecond Arusha Regional Summit on Burundi on31 July 1996. The international community must not  oneday  say that it did not know. The countries of oursubregion were more than anyone else aware of the chaoticand complicated situation in Burundi before 25 July 1996.They also knew of the almost total institutional paralysis asa result of the crisis. Every day they see my country’scontinuous struggle to restore peace and security despite thehost of difficulties before us.We therefore see the embargo imposed on Burundias unfriendly  unjust and illegal. It violates internationalpublic law and the international accords and conventionsthat our countries have ratified. The embargo  which isreally a total economic blockade against my country constitutes a dangerous precedent  violating Article 1 paragraph 2  of the Charter of the United Nationsregarding the right of peoples to self-determination andthe sovereignty and equality of States.This blockade flouts the principle of non-interferencein the internal affairs of other States as stipulated inArticle III  paragraph 2  of the Charter of theOrganization of African Unity and the Declaration of24 October 1970 adopted by the General Assembly on theduty of States to refrain from interfering in the domesticaffairs of other States.The nature of the sanctions adopted flies in the faceof the principle of the non-use of force and the peacefulsettlement of international disputes in accordance with theDeclaration of 24 October 1970 adopted by the GeneralAssembly. We know that States are prohibited from usingforce against another State  even in the case of damagescaused by the latter.In the case of Burundi  there was no damage to anyof our neighbours. However  our access to the sea  ourright of transit and our freedom of trade have been takenaway. The illegality of the embargo is obvious  sinceinternational and regional treaties recognizing MemberStates’ freedom of transit have been violated.These instruments include the Marrakesh Agreementestablishing the World Trade Organization  the treaty onthe Common Market of Eastern and Southern Africa  theConvention on Transit Trade of Land-Locked States  notto mention the charters and agreements of neighbouringcountries  such as the Economic Community of the GreatLakes Countries and the preferential trade area.What is worse — and we would emphasize this herebefore the General Assembly — the sanctions imposedare hindering the action of our Government  weakeningthe chances for peace and working in favour of theextremist militias and armed bands  which feelencouraged by them. At this very moment  the latter areusing the embargo to intensify their acts of violence anddestruction in the country.The embargo imposed on Burundi has hadcatastrophic consequences on people who  as a result  find4themselves deprived of urgently needed medications vaccines  diagnostic materials and surgical instruments.Today  children  women and the elderly are dying.The vaccination rate  which  because of three years ofwar  has fallen from 80 per cent to 30 per cent amongchildren under five years of age  may soon reach zero ifnothing is done to improve the situation in the meantime.That will necessarily have an impact on the most vulnerablemembers of the population. Further  the population ofBurundi is at risk of widespread famine  which will haveunfortunate consequences for the inhabitants ofneighbouring countries. It will have a greater impact on themost vulnerable  namely  displaced persons  the homelessand the repatriated  which latter group has already beenliving for three years now in inhuman conditions. Nearly80 per cent of them are children  women and the elderly.Lastly  owing to lack of fuel and non-availability ofeducational materials  a large number of pupils and studentsmay leave school. The drop-out rate is already 18 per centfor secondary education  21 per cent for technical trainingand 20 per cent for university studies.As for the economic aspects of the embargo  I wouldpoint out that Burundi lives essentially on agriculture andanimal husbandry. There will be a sharp decline in ourharvest if fertilizers  concentrates and veterinarypharmaceuticals continue to be held by embargo in theports of neighbouring countries. The result will obviouslybe widespread famine.The few industries still operating are graduallyshutting down owing to lack of raw materials. Staterevenues are at a dangerously low level because of ourinability to export and import. That will lead tounemployment or inability to pay workers in both thepublic and private sectors and foment social unrest that willincrease insecurity and destabilize the country. Overall  thesituation will favour the retaking of territory and strengthenthe armed actions of rebel groups and other outlaw bandsagainst the peaceful population  with the risk of widespreadcivil war.This apocalyptic prospect can and must be avoided.The neighbouring countries behind the embargo haddemanded that the new regime end its suspension of theNational Assembly and political parties and commit itselfto dialogue with the armed groups  points that are prioritiesof the new regime’s programme made public on25 July 1996. Decree Number 100-023 of13 September 1996 has just reinstated Parliament  thepolitical parties and political associations.Furthermore  the Government of Burundi has justreiterated its solemn commitment to engage in dialogueand to discuss all the country’s fundamental questionswith all interested political partners  including armedgroups. We renew that commitment here before theAssembly.That measure  which is already a priority of the newregime  was the latest recommendation of the ArushaSummit Meeting on 31 July 1996. Now that myGovernment has responded positively and promptly to theconditions fixed by its neighbours  we invite them to takeall appropriate steps to lift the embargo immediately so asto alleviate the indescribable suffering of the people ofBurundi and to enable dialogue — which is also hinderedby the embargo — to take place by opening lines ofcommunication  both on the ground and in the air  and byfulfilling their commitments.My country  Burundi  seeks to play an active andconstructive role in the development of peaceful  friendlyand mutually beneficial relations with countries of theregion and the rest of the world. In return  we require ofour partners that they refrain from threat or use of forceor from any other action incompatible with the purposesand principles of the United Nations Charter.Because of the war and the embargo  my countrycontinues to suffer from a very critical economicsituation. It is land-locked and therefore must rely on itsneighbours for the transit of its exports and imports. Forthat reason  we attach great importance to the policy ofgood-neighbourliness and non-interference in the internalaffairs of other States.My Government is perfectly well aware of theconcerns of the international community over the crisis inBurundi. We express our gratitude to all our bilateral andmultilateral partners that have given us their support solidarity and understanding in this difficult period.However  we remain convinced that the impositionof conditions about the pace and the way to resolve thecurrent conflict cannot benefit the people of Burundi. Weare determined to find lasting and definitive solutions tothe evil that is eroding Burundi  but such complexproblems cannot be resolved by precipitate action or byholding a knife to our throats.5The political situation in the Great Lakes regioncontinues to be cause for concern. This geographical areaholds the sad world record for number of refugees.Following the genocide carried out in Rwanda in April1994  several hundreds of thousands of persons soughtasylum in neighbouring countries  particularly in Zaire andTanzania.Following the crisis of October 1993  those countriesalso contained tens of thousands of Burundi’s citizens  whoswelled the ranks of those gone into exile. InFebruary 1995 an international Conference about this thornyquestion was held in Bujumbura  under the auspices of theOrganization of African Unity (OAU) and the UnitedNations Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees.The decisions and recommendations made at that time haveremained virtually a dead letter. However  we have notedthe voluntary and peaceful repatriation of a large number ofRwandan refugees who had sought asylum in Burundi.The OAU and the United Nations  through the Officeof the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees should step up their initiatives designed to encourage allpersons who wish to return to their countries once theconditions of peace and security have been met. Theauthorities of the countries concerned must  of course  playa primary role. The Government of Burundi  for its part  isprepared to welcome at any time all of our nationals whowish to return to their respective homes. To that end  it isnow organizing and doing all it can to bring about the rapidrestoration of a climate of peace  understanding andnational reconciliation.We encourage all efforts being made by neighbouringcountries  by friendly countries  the Organization of AfricanUnity  the European Union and the United Nations onbehalf of this troubled region and to return the situation asa whole to normal.At the same time  we draw the attention of theinternational community to other scourges and otherphenomena that are rife in this geographical area. I amreferring to the trafficking in and proliferation of weaponsand the training of militias and armed groups that fomentterrorism and threaten the security of our fellow citizensfrom certain neighbouring countries.We note the spread of the ideology of genocide hatred  violence and marginalization made manifest inintolerance and ethnic fundamentalism. The pernicious ideaspropagated by the champions of those ideologies will  inthe long term  generate social upheavals with political andethnic roots that will in turn cause enormous human andmaterial damage. The genocide in Rwanda  the massacresperpetrated in Burundi since the October 1993 crisis  thekillings we have witnessed in South Kivu  in particular inthe Massissi region and very recently in the region ofUvira  are the best example of this threat to peace andsecurity in our subregion.The international community must mobilize tocombat such inhuman and degrading acts  whosephilosophy is so strangely reminiscent of notoriousHitlerite nazism.With regard to the other conflicts with which Africais beset  the Government of Burundi welcomes thepositive developments in the situation in Somalia and inLiberia. It appreciates the decisive role played by theOAU  the United Nations and subregional organizationsin helping to sort out differences and commit the partiesto disputes to a process of peace and reconciliation.In that connection  my Government welcomes theestablishment by the OAU of a Mechanism for ConflictPrevention  Management and Resolution. African leadershave thereby demonstrated their determination to becomemore involved in solving problems on their owncontinent.We take this opportunity to express our thanks to theEuropean Union  the United Nations and other bilateralpartners for the political  material and financial supportgiven that initiative. To that end  Burundi is convinced ofthe overriding importance of preventive diplomacy andthe peaceful settlement of disputes through dialogue andnegotiation.The United Nations has two main priorities  namely the Agenda for Peace and the Agenda for Development.Their success entails a determined struggle againstterrorism and organized crime as well as the eliminationof the nuclear threat. Burundi therefore supports theorganization of an international criminal tribunal.Burundi’s representative to the United Nations hasjust signed the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.My Government warmly welcomes that noble decision bythe General Assembly of our Organization. It is a signallyimportant step towards the establishment of a world ofpeace free from the threat of meaningless death caused byman himself.The Government of Burundi is also concerned aboutother contemporary scourges  such as the trafficking in6and the distribution and consumption of drugs and otherpsychotropic substances. They are a grave danger especially for our young people who are our future. Apartfrom their deleterious effects on health  they are aformidable weapon in the hands of the supporters ofinternational terrorism.For that reason  we wholeheartedly support effortsbeing made within the framework of internationalcooperation to eradicate that disaster confronting humanity.We emphasize this fact  for armed groups that areorganized to rob  rape  burn and kill sate themselves withthese harmful substances to kill in cold blood  withoutremorse and without pity.Several delegations have recognized the fact that manyAfrican Governments are increasingly committed toshouldering their responsibilities for the development oftheir continent. It has been noted  in particular  that over thepast two years the average growth rate in gross domesticproduct has reached 5 per cent. Those efforts deserve encouragement.Nevertheless  the burden of external debt continues toweigh heavily on many of our countries and oftenundermines their development efforts. That is why theGovernment of Burundi pleads for the substantial easing ofexternal debt in order to give every chance to programmesaimed at improving the living standard of our people.I should like to join other eminent heads of delegationwho have spoken earlier in announcing that myGovernment shares the hope that our Organization will bereformed and made into an efficient and effectiveinstrument better able to respond to the purposes andprinciples assigned it by its founding fathers. The UnitedNations must adapt its structures and working methods tothe current and future concerns of our planet and allhumankind.We view with special attention the ongoingdiscussions on restructuring the Security Council to allowfor more equitable representation in that body  to increaseits membership and to achieve its general democratization.Given their political and economic advantages  Germanyand Japan have legitimate aspirations for permanent seatsin the Security Council  as does Italy. Since none of theproposals before us commands general support  it is just aslegitimate to take into account the cogent suggestion putforward by Italy for a possible rotation of permanent seatsamong States of respective regions. We believe that Africa Asia and Latin America should have at least two permanentseats per region in that lofty  decision-making body of theOrganization.My country  Burundi  wishes to reaffirm its totalcommitment to and unswerving support for the nobleideas upheld by the Organization. We hope that theUnited Nations will continue to move forward in thestruggle against racism  intolerance  xenophobia  terrorismand child prostitution. It is our ardent desire to see thisvast home of mankind promote and further promulgatethe values of peace  freedom and mutual respect andfraternity among men in order to stave off for all time thespectre of war  hunger and famine in the world  througha more generous and more committed internationalcooperation. All countries of the world  rich and poor small and large  are urged to join forces to meet thatchallenge: the challenge of building a better future in amore just  more peaceful  more human world."
"13",497,"BEL",51,1996,"﻿The opening of the fifty-first session of the GeneralAssembly  under the presidency of Ambassador Razili takes place at the very moment a large number of Stateshave entered into new commitments on the long road tonuclear disarmament. Our signature  this very morning  ofthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty is anotheropportunity for Belgium to reiterate its determination tocontribute to the fight against nuclear proliferation. I amvery happy that this important step was taken today. Itshould inspire us to continue our common effort towardsuniversal acceptance of this new international instrument as well as an effective implementation of the internationalverification measures it provides.My Irish colleague  Minister Dick Spring  has spokenon behalf of the European Union  whose objectives andconcerns my country shares. Belgium endeavours tocontribute substantially to the definition and implementationof the policies and plans of action which the EuropeanUnion intends to carry out throughout the world.Our intentions before this Assembly should aim to gobeyond formalities. Diplomatic language all too often hidesour inability to act or our lack of real compassion.The citizens of the world are fearful as we come tothe end of the century. Whatever their country  people areconfronted with a new anxiety  a fear of tomorrow  withouteven realizing that these feelings are shared by the entireworld. In numerous regions of the world  this is a fear ofphysical danger. It is a fear of external threats  aggressionand civil war. People die in the same way in Africa  Asia America and Europe. People are killed for the samedreams and mutilated in body and spirit by the barbarismof modern weaponry and criminal madness born ofhatred.Yes  our world is fearful in the face of all theseviolations of fundamental human rights which persistnotwithstanding the major conferences proclaiming ourhope and belief in a world where the rights of men women and children are respected. In such a worldrespect for humanitarian law need no longer bequestioned.The crises felt by rich countries cannot possiblycompare with the tragic consequences of war andunderdevelopment. Yet the crises in Europe  in ourprosperous societies  also constitute a humanitariandeficit. They are also the symptoms — albeit of adifferent nature — of the same ills of modern times.These include contempt for the human person as a subjectof law and his reduction to mere merchandise. Today society everywhere is in crisis. The logic of the marketseems to be an exclusionary mechanism which segregatessociety. As the Mexican poet Octavio Paz once wrote “The society of consumption has chilled human lifewith its glacial waters of selfish calculation.”This dehumanization of mankind for financial profit is theprimary cause of many scourges which affect our planet irrespective of the traditions and political systems thatcharacterize each and every region of the world.In this respect the inertia of individuals transformedinto consumers rather than dynamic actors comes to mind as do the problems of unemployment  the scourges oftrade in human beings  child prostitution  organ trading drugs and all other international criminal activities. Thesecalamities of modern times require the internationalcommunity to put in place effective mechanisms by whichwe can combat them together.As I said during the World Congress AgainstCommercial Sexual Exploitation of Children  which washeld in Stockholm last August  we must join efforts wills  means and resources to eliminate and prevent theproliferation of these activities on our planet. Thebehaviour of those who profit from such cruel treatment0of human beings must be punished by the internationalcommunity.Belgium strongly believes that the provisions of theStockholm declaration and programme of action tocriminalize the sexual exploitation of children should betranslated into new treaty obligations for all States. Theongoing negotiations on the adoption of the optionalprotocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child seemto me the appropriate forum to reach this goal.The protection of children in this field should equallyinspire us to a creative and courageous approach in otherUnited Nations forums where the question of internationalcriminalization of the trade in human beings is dealt with.The Stockholm declaration and programme of action shouldtherefore be reflected in the texts we adopt during the fifty-first session of the General Assembly in order to strengthenthe protection of the rights of the child and to condemnstrongly the exploitation of children.This year  the International Day for the Abolition ofSlavery  2 December 1996  will be devoted to the trade inhuman beings. The whole world should endeavour to bringthis horrendous scandal to an end.Although we must tackle these social problems  ouraction should first be introspective in order for it to becredible and efficient. How can modern society bereconciled with the globalization of cultures and trade?How can the balance between the resources of richcountries and the needs of poor countries be restored?The freedom of the market cannot be absolute  lest itbecome an absurdity. Our societies can only be viable ifthey result from a balance between the freedom of theindividual and the fundamental rights of the other. Theunfortunate evolution of our consumer society and theabandonment of humanist values could lead us — as theevents of this summer in my country have shown — to asociety where murder and rape become commonplace forsome and where abuse is tolerated for too long. We musttherefore reconstruct our list of moral priorities and crate anew international moral code based on simple  readilyimplemented priorities.Peace  non-violence and acceptance of the other headthe list  followed by sharing and social solidarity. Manneeds to be reconciled with modern times  reclaiming hiscentral role as subject and actor rather than object andmerchandise. These values also should determine therelations between rich and poor countries. Finally  ourchildren should be trained to be involved  responsiblecitizens  conscious of the consequences of their actions onsociety. I believe that the formulation of a newinternational moral code is necessary if we are toovercome our fears and rediscover our will to act — tofulfil our moral duty to take an optimistic approach tointernational cooperation.This is why preventive diplomacy must be one ofour top priorities. Belgium neither can nor wants toignore the need to turn its attention to the South  to Africain particular. We must overcome the desperation ofcertain situations and do everything within our means tofinally allow the development of justice  social progressand democracy in Africa. The situation is extremelytroublesome and warrants our basing our political actionon the essential priorities  which are  in fact  challengesto be overcome. What are these challenges? to avoid newfratricidal wars and genocide; to ensure that in existingconflicts international humanitarian law is respected; andto guarantee the reconstruction and sustainabledevelopment of the continent with full respect for humanrights and the rule of law. We should develop our policieswhile keeping in mind the fundamental relationships thatmust be constructed between these complementaryobjectives.In particular  I am thinking of former PresidentNyerere’s work in Central Africa. Our support for thiswork shows our willingness to cooperate with theOrganization of African Unity (OAU) and the countriesof the region in trying  together  to find solutions to thepresent crisis and to prevent hatred  death and the ravagesof destruction from overrunning Africa  which is dear tous. Belgium supports the convening of a conference onsecurity and stability in the Great Lakes region.The appointment of Mr. Ajello as Special Envoy ofthe European Union and of Ambassador Haesendonck asBelgian Special Envoy to the region shows thewillingness of the European Union and Belgium toaddress these concerns. For 1996 and 1997  the BelgianGovernment has made financial resources available tosupport the efforts under way. The survival of thepopulations of Burundi and Rwanda and of the Kivupeople in Zaire is at stake  as well as the security andprosperity of Central Africa as a whole.Within the framework of a policy of conflictprevention which the European Union  in cooperationwith the OAU  is trying to elaborate  the WesternEuropean Union (WEU)  of which Belgium currently1holds the chairmanship  is also prepared to offer logisticalsupport to African peacekeeping operations. The WEU’sfact-finding mission to Ethiopia  Tanzania  Uganda andKenya returned with strong conclusions  and we intend topursue the recommended course of action during ourchairmanship. My country  which for years has participatedin stand-by agreements  must review the mechanisms thatmight be established to improve the functioning of theseagreements.In this context  I wish to recall our willingness tosupport logistically and financially any possible contingencyplanning for Burundi. Possibly in a revised form  theagreements reached in Arusha last 25 June and 31 Julyshould allow support for the normalization efforts inBurundi. This option would clearly be preferred to anyother possible solution. The Belgian Government would liketo confirm here its political will to be associated with thispossible assistance to the security of Burundi  taking intoaccount the modalities that are yet to be defined. However it is my deepest wish that the Burundi authorities and allactive parties in that country will find the road to nationalreconciliation and peace  to a system of government whichguarantees equitable representation and real protection ofminorities. I wish to recall that Security Council resolution1072 (1996) of 30 August demands that these negotiationsbe initiated before 31 October.Belgium’s preventive diplomacy efforts should also beseen in the framework of European Union initiatives topromote the development of these new societies. Thepresidential  legislative  regional and local elections to beheld in Zaire in 1997 are an opportunity for the BelgianGovernment and the European Union to show their activesolidarity within the framework of collective electoralassistance  which must be coordinated by the UnitedNations. In order to organize this electoral assistance  Iwould hope that a representative of the Secretary-Generalcould be appointed as soon as possible. Zaire’s people havethe right to participate knowledgeably in free and fairelections. The international community has the obligation tofacilitate the democratic process in Zaire.The Belgian Government is aware of the difficulty ofarriving at a global approach to the problems of the South and of Central Africa in particular. We do not believe thatwe should impose upon other countries any system ofgovernment or dictate the way to achieve this. But we mustinsist on the concept of good governance. That is  thereshould be systems of government with checks and balances which guarantee the free exercise of the civil  political social and cultural rights of the people  and which enhancethe development of a free and dynamic society — theonly way to ensure harmonious and sustainabledevelopment.Preventive diplomacy is meaningless if weaponsremain available to extremist groups who seek  by thesuppression of others and by ""ethnic cleansing""  solutionsto problems which should only be found in dialogue consensus and political negotiation. The United NationsRegister of Conventional Arms is an essential element inmaking the arms trade transparent  a goal which mycountry and others support. Since its inception  Belgiumhas provided the arms Register with the informationrequested. The extension of the Register to othercategories of arms is extremely desirable. The BelgianGovernment believes nevertheless that  for now  the mainpriority should be making the Register universal. We together with our partners of the European Union  willcontinue to concentrate our efforts on this aspect.Anti-personnel mines are particularly inhumaneweapons. Belgium is tirelessly pursuing  in everyinternational forum  its objective of total and universalprohibition of anti-personnel mines. The BelgianGovernment regrets that very little progress has beenmade to date. Next October we will participate in theOttawa conference which  I hope  will be able to give asignificant boost to the achievement of our objectives.When preventive diplomacy and arms control cannotkeep peace  peacekeeping missions become necessary. Inour view  these peacekeeping and peace-restorationmissions remain one of the primary responsibilities of theUnited Nations. The Belgian Government has taken partin various peacekeeping operations and is assumingmilitary leadership of the United Nations TransitionalAdministration for Eastern Slavonia  Baranja and WesternSirmium (UNTAES). I am convinced that the success ofUNTAES will contribute significantly to there-establishment of a society which we hope will bepluralist  tolerant and peaceful. Last year  the GeneralFramework Agreement  negotiated in Dayton and signedin Paris led to the establishment  under United Nationsauspices  of the NATO-led implementation force (IFOR).My country is  with its partners  part of this peacekeepingoperation whose role is to be a force for solidarity reconstruction and hope for a new Europe. The recentelections in Bosnia and Herzegovina allow us to looktoward the future with a degree of optimism.The increase in number and size of peacekeepingoperations that has characterized the recent history of our2Organization has allowed the development of politicalconcepts and given a new dimension to internationalmilitary cooperation. It has also allowed for positive andnecessary developments in the field of internationalhumanitarian law. The Belgian Government hopes that therecent agreement between the International Committee ofthe Red Cross (ICRC) and the Secretariat on theapplicability of humanitarian law to peacekeepingoperations will permit a swift adoption of the lines ofconduct to this effect. This is indispensable and should bewelcomed unreservedly by all troop-contributing countries.For peacekeeping operations to succeed they must befollowed up by rehabilitation programmes. Obviously  theseprogrammes  which are meant to eliminate the potentialcauses of new conflicts  must be developed in a climate ofpeace that ensures respect for human rights.This fin de siècle is characterized by the size andurgency of rehabilitation operations and by humanitarianintervention and aid. Despite exceptional crises situations we must not forget the importance of implementing globaland sustainable development. The major thematicconferences of the United Nations were designed toestablish a strategy for the growth of the human being. Ibelieve that the effective implementation of the moral andpolitical decisions taken at these major conferences is fullyin keeping with the new moral code that I hope to seeemerge.In this context  I would like to mention the efforts toreform United Nations institutions and  in particular  thequest for efficiency and sound financial management thatshould be the watchword of the functioning of ourorganizations.I began my statement today by denouncing fear andwith a plea for a new international moral code. I would liketo conclude an observation that I made at the outset: thatwords are hollow if they are mere figures of speech anddiplomatic formulas. Our words must be alive  and theymust spring from peace  silence and complete transparency.Only then will we be able to understand the language of themany children  women and men afflicted byunderdevelopment  war and indifference."
"14",542,"BEN",51,1996,"﻿Likethe speakers who have preceded me at this rostrum  I wishto extend to you  Sir  the warm and sincere congratulationsof the delegation of Benin to the President on hisunanimous selection to preside over the work of theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-first session. This choiceconstitutes clear recognition of his exceptional personalqualities and his wealth of experience as a seasoneddiplomat  and it is a collective tribute to his beautifulcountry  Malaysia  whose dynamism and outstandingeconomic success over the past few years I salute. From therostrum of this Assembly  I should like to make acontribution to this important session by expressing amessage of peace  solidarity  faith and hope from thepeople and the Government of Benin.A year ago  in this very Hall  in commemoration of itsfiftieth anniversary  the United Nations hosted the greatestgathering of Heads of State in history. In this setting theycarried out a critical  objective and unsparing assessment ofthe 50 years of the Organization’s existence  a periodduring which international cooperation made it possible toachieve significant progress on each of the principlesenshrined in the Charter. In the Declaration they adopted the Heads of State and Government solemnly reaffirmedtheir dedication to the great ideals of peace  developmentand democracy inscribed in the founding texts of theOrganization.Given this commitment by world leaders on thethreshold of a new millennium  the imperative of peacemust  more than ever  remain the ultimate goal of theinternational community as a whole. This is all the moreurgent because  despite the end of the cold war  the peaceand security of nations seem far from being fully assured.Indeed  in many respects  on the political and securitylevel the international situation remains worrying especially on the African continent  where the course ofhistory too often bears the imprint of tragic events towhich the international community cannot remainindifferent.The resurgence of conflicts which  for the most part no longer take place between States but within nations  isa challenge for which the Organization must adopt newmethods and machinery for intervention and settlement.This means  therefore  that to be able to promoteharmonious relations among the peoples of the world andto guarantee a lasting peace  our shared Organizationmust strengthen its capabilities and its means in conflictprevention  peacekeeping and the consolidation of peace.It cannot be stressed enough that  despite the difficulties inadequacies and gaps that reduce or restrict the scopeand effectiveness of its actions  the United Nationsrepresents  embodies and remains — today and  doubtless for a long time to come — the body that can best expressand bring to a successful conclusion the will of MemberStates to work for the consolidation of peace and thepursuit of economic and social progress.Despite the new international situation that promotesless aggressive  less suspicious and less tense relationsbetween States  the political instability that continues toexist in certain parts of Africa  and the conflicts thatdevelop there  have become significant barriers to theeconomic recovery and social cohesion of the continent.In this context  I wish to refer to the very worryingsituation in Burundi  where the unjust system of socio-ethnic relations  military intransigence and politicalintolerance pointlessly prolong the suffering and divisionof a people. It is deplorable that on 25 July 1996 a13military coup ended  by force  Burundi’s constitutional democratic and legal institutions.My country  Benin  welcomes the strong andcourageous reaction of the countries of the subregion andencourages their efforts for a peaceful  just and lastingsettlement of the crisis in Burundi.Benin supports the efforts of the Heads of State ofcountries of the Great Lakes region and of the Organizationof African Unity to make the new authorities in Burundiquickly embark on negotiations and abide by decisionswhich should result from constructive and sound concertedaction on the part of the healthy forces of this batteredpeople. The various protagonists must understand that onlya new political agreement  based on ordinary commonsense  with respect for the intangible principles ofdemocracy  human rights and fundamental freedoms  willcontribute to an acceptable solution to all.Regarding the situation in Liberia  the summit meetingof the Committee of Nine on Liberia of the EconomicCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS)  held on 17August 1996  took important decisions to extend the AbujaAgreements of 1995  which are rightly considered to be theappropriate legal framework for a definitive settlement ofthe conflict. This last Abuja summit also drew up a newtimetable for the implementation of the peace process  anddefined the modalities and stages to lead to democraticelections. Benin urgently demands that the Liberian factionstake advantage of this last opportunity and strictly abide bythe Abuja decisions  in order to speed up the return of theircountry to normality.My country also invites the international communityto support the efforts of ECOWAS by stepping up itsfinancial and logistical assistance for the successfulimplementation of the Abuja decisions.The most important thing for a nation in crisis is thesearch for compromise to settle internal contradictions  nomatter how serious they are. This truth has been tried andtested elsewhere  in Mozambique for example  andrecently in Angola  the results of which we note withsatisfaction. Hence the appeal which I am renewing here before this Assembly  for sincere dialogue in Rwanda Somalia  the Sudan  Sierra Leone  the Middle East — ina word  wherever passions continue at the end of thetwentieth century to cloud reason and block the genuinestruggle for development and democracy.Everyone agrees that peace  if it is to be genuine andlasting  must be based on general and completedisarmament under international control. Here  I shouldlike to say how gratified Benin is at the signature of thePelindaba Treaty for the establishment of an Africannuclear-weapon-free zone.The Review and Extension Conference of the Partiesto the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of NuclearWeapons (NPT)  held from 17 April to 12 May 1995 decided to renew the Treaty indefinitely  thus opening theway to better prospects in the area of nucleardisarmament. Benin  which has worked for this  believesin the strengthening of the provisions of the Treaty  inparticular regarding the verification regime  in order tomake it a genuine international instrument for effectivenuclear disarmament and a solid basis for more fruitfulinternational cooperation in the area of the use of nucleartechnology for peaceful purposes.While the commitment to non-proliferation anddisarmament has been gaining ground throughout theglobe  the resumption or continuation of nuclear testspainfully reminded us of the dangers and horrors whichhaunted the collective psyche of nations during the cold-war period. This is why Benin can only welcome thepositive decision taken by France and recently by thePeople’s Republic of China to put an end to their nucleartesting programmes.The signing of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-BanTreaty during the present session will most certainly marka major stage in the achievement of an objective which isdecisive  even vital  for the international community: thatof disarmament and non-proliferation.As we can read in the Declaration on the Occasionof the Fiftieth Anniversary of the United Nations 14“action to ensure peace  security and stability in theworld will be futile unless the economic and socialneeds of people are addressed.” (resolution 50/6  para.1)This means that peace comes to nothing if the imperativeof development is not guaranteed. Here  it is important toemphasize that many countries in Africa have madeconsiderable progress in the key areas of protecting mothersand their children  of health  of nutrition and of education but  from one end of the continent to the other  gainscontinue to be drastically limited as a result of endemicpoverty and economic regression.Recent developments in the global economy and theserious obstacles encountered by the efforts of thedeveloping countries  particularly the least-developedcountries  are a cause of profound concern for us asAfricans.The accelerated globalization of the rules and practicesof the system of market economies has led to theemergence of a new economic order within which Africa for the most part  remains marginalized. The agreements ofthe Uruguay Round concluded in 1994  the rapidredefinition of economic groupings in the developedcountries  and the ever more important role of privatecapital in the world economy  have created a newinternational environment in which the interests of Africado not seem to have been taken into account  or in whichthey are even threatened or compromised.While it is true that socio-economic development inAfrica is first of all the responsibility of the peoples andGovernments of the African countries themselves  it nonethe less remains true that the international community  inparticular its most developed and industrialized members must do their part  a part commensurate with their truemeans  in the development process of a continent involvedin a dual economic and political transition.At a time when one has reason to fear the resurgenceof national selfishness  the temptations of protectionism andof isolationism  the international community should providea clear response  a concrete solution that can be rapidlyapplied to the problems experienced by the developingworld  in particular Africa. These well-known problemsinclude the burden of foreign debt  the alarming reductionin capital flows  the trend toward a decline in officialdevelopment assistance  the weak rate of investment  thecontinued imbalance in the terms of trade — despite thedevaluation of the CFA Franc in January 1994 —protectionism on export markets  continued weakcommodities prices  and so on.We have every right to be pleased that over the lastfive years  the struggle to eradicate poverty has been aprominent issue in negotiations and the drafting ofdeclarations and programmes of action adopted bysummits and conferences organized under the auspices ofthe United Nations.As we approach the end of the International Year forthe Eradication of Poverty and the beginning next year 1997  of the United Nations Decade for the Eradication ofPoverty  new national and international efforts must bemade to mobilize the vast resources needed to eliminatepoverty.In addition  as the decisions and recommendations ofthe Second United Nations Conference on HumanSettlements (Habitat II) are implemented  they will betangible assets for present and future generations in theprocess of building a more human and better societythrough exercise of the right to adequate housing for all.Environmental protection is essential if we are topromote sustainable development. Faced with the threatto mankind posed by the rise in sea levels  globalwarming  creeping desertification and the disappearanceof biological diversity  Benin attaches the utmostimportance to implementation of all the agreementsreached in Rio and  here  renews its commitment to doingall it can to ensure the success of the special session ofthe General Assembly planned for June 1997 tostrengthen implementation of the decisions andrecommendations of the Earth Summit contained inAgenda 21. In accordance with the commitments made atthe United Nations Conference on Environment andDevelopment in June 1992 in Rio  by the end of the yearBenin will have adopted its own national Agenda 21 and at the same time  will begin drawing up localAgendas 21.In the context of the effective implementation of theprovisions of the United Nations Convention to ControlDesertification in those Countries Experiencing SeriousDrought and/or Desertification  particularly in Africa  theGovernment of Benin held a national forum from 20 to22 August 1996 which was the starting point for theprocess of drawing up its national programme of action tocombat desertification through a partnership ofGovernment  local populations  non-governmental15organizations  development associations  the private sectorand development partners.I should like to take this opportunity to thank theinterim secretariat of the Convention and  above all  theGovernment of Germany and the United NationsDevelopment Programme  whose technical and financialsupport proved decisive in the holding of this successfulforum.It is regrettable that five years after it was launched the United Nations New Agenda for the Development ofAfrica in the 1990s has not had the expected impact on thedevelopment of Africa even though the priorities our Statesopted for were largely in line with its objectives  includingin the area of democratic and macroeconomic reforms.This is why Benin welcomes the launching by theSecretary-General on 15 March 1996 of the United NationsSystem-wide Special Initiative on Africa  an initiative thatcomplements the New Agenda and provides it with newimpetus. I should like here to reaffirm Benin’s adherence tothis Initiative whose objectives fit perfectly with those ofour national development plans. Implementation of thepriority actions of the Initiative require the mobilization ofAfricans themselves  bodies of the United Nations systemand Africa’s development partners to ensure ambitious concerted and coordinated action designed to lead totangible results in Africa.We applaud the initiatives of the United Nationssystem which has long been working for the developmentof Africa  as well as the actions of all partners for thedevelopment of Africa  including France and Japan  whichhave made the development and economic recovery ofAfrica a priority.We appeal to all Member States diligently toimplement the results of the mid-term review of UnitedNations New Agenda in order to accelerate the process ofstrengthening the effective integration of Africa into theinternational trading system  help Africa diversify itseconomy and encourage direct foreign investment.Along the same lines  The Agenda for Development which Benin actively helped to draft  should be effectivelyimplemented to achieve the development objectives ofdeveloping countries  the least-developed countries inparticular.Massive and persistent human rights violations aretoday both source and consequence of ethnic  racial andreligious tensions which continue to persist in certainparts of the globe  particularly on our continent  Africa.The Government of Benin considers that all States whatever their political system  their economic level andtheir culture  have a duty to promote  protect and respecthuman rights and fundamental freedoms. In this regard Benin reaffirms its deep commitment to respect forhuman rights and fundamental freedoms  whosepromotion and protection are a legitimate concern of theinternational community.For our part  we in Benin have continued to strive toconsolidate our new democratic experience which hasbeen in place since the historic National Conference ofActive Forces of the Nation in February 1990.I know that all members have been following withinterest  and are well informed about  the deep-seatedqualitative changes in the political life of Benin and Iwish to take advantage of this opportunity to thankeveryone for the genuine interest with which they havefollowed our major political event: the recent presidentialelection in March 1996  in which we could see a peacefuland orderly democratic transfer of power  withoutviolence or bloodshed  which was totally in keeping withthe rule of constitutional law in force since December1990. The generally correct and normal conduct of theballot  the peaceful behaviour of the vast majority of ourpolitical classes  the courageous and responsible attitudeof the people of Benin and the unwavering stance takencontinually by the Constitutional Court are all signs whichdemonstrate genuine political maturity and an irrevocablecommitment to building a truly democratic society in theRepublic of Benin.To complete its programme of building a State basedon the rule of law and a prosperous nation in which allcitizens of Benin would enjoy a certain minimumstandard of living  the Government of Benin wishes tobenefit further from the support and assistance of theentire international community. We are well aware of thefact that merely going through the motions of an electionis not enough to install and guarantee lasting democracyin a country.For democracy to have real meaning and for apeople to fully enjoy the freedom and salvation it brings it must be expressed both on the national andinternational levels. This means that democracy mustalso underlie and govern the organization and conduct ofinternational relations. The world  so long divided byEast-West antagonism and by North-South imbalances 16can and must conceive and implement new  democraticrelations among States. Here it is no exaggeration to saythat the renewal of the United Nations begun thanks to thecourageous  tenacious and fruitful actions of Mr. BoutrosBoutros-Ghali must be resolutely sustained and developedto guarantee the conditions necessary for the harmoniouspursuit of the process of democratization in internationalsociety on the eve of the twenty-first century. Thedelegation of Benin is convinced that our presentdeliberations on all issues of reform of the Organizationwill be guided by our shared determination to takeconcerted  specific and realistic measures which  better thanin the past  respond to the great stakes and challengesemerging on the horizon of the twenty-first century."
"15",588,"BFA",51,1996,"﻿Like some others present here  I too have had theopportunity to visit Malaysia. Malaysia is a great country both in size and because of its outstanding successes inmany areas. But it is a great country above all because ofthe quality of the women and men who govern it and whorepresent it on the international scene. Ambassador RazaliIsmail is without doubt one of its most eminentrepresentatives. I am therefore convinced that he willpreside over the work of our 51-year-old Organization withgreat cheer and efficiency. I convey to him and to all theelected members of the Bureau my congratulations andbest wishes for success.I would also like to congratulate his predecessor Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral  whose personal qualitiesand wealth of experience guided the work of the historicfiftieth session in an exemplary manner. We wish toconvey our great gratitude to him.Finally  I pay well-deserved tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for his outstandingefforts to strengthen the role of the United Nations andfor the talent and tenacity with which he has guided theOrganization in these difficult times.In July 1996  the Assembly of Heads of State andGovernment of the Organization of African Unity adoptedin Yaoundé  Cameroon  a declaration expressing itsappreciation for and stressing the work done byMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali at the helm of the UnitedNations. According to tradition and the rules of fairness Africa is entitled to a second mandate  which we hopewill come about.The current trends on the international scene aredisquieting. The sovereign equality of States and theprinciple of free trade are being damaged by unilateralmeasures  despite the fact that the General Assembly ofthe United Nations has reaffirmed these principles and thestrict respect that should be accorded to them. Moreover we are facing a financial crisis that is essentially causedby the default on payments of assessed contributions dueto the Organization. The overwhelming majority ofspeakers who have preceded me have said that thispractice is unacceptable  particularly on the part of thosewho have the capacity to pay.The procedures and decision-making process of theSecurity Council are still fairly opaque  despite someminor openings. The geographical origins of thepermanent members run counter to the principle ofequitable geographical distribution. The cause of this ishistorical  but this perception is now more widespread andstark  51 years after the creation of the Organization. Yettoday  through the deliberations and decisions of theSecurity Council  a veritable body of substantiveinternational law  armed with sanctions and strewn withad hoc tribunals  is emerging. After 51 years  the GeneralAssembly  the pedestal and guarantor of this structure finds itself stripped of its powers and even of itsfunctions.We cannot compare the General Assembly to theSecurity Council but recent developments in these twobodies have accentuated their differences instead ofemphasizing their complementarity  which is not a healthysituation. Ironically  this situation coincides with thevehement  ongoing clamour for transparency and democracyeverywhere. The reform of the United Nations system isunderstood in various ways and we have yet to find theformula that can be supported by everyone. Difficultiesarise from the demands of some and the reluctance ofothers. Clearly  reform must be a joint effort or it will notcome about. We are concerned because all of thesecombined factors might encourage the disturbing trends towhich I referred earlier.Indeed  the financial situation of the United Nations iscentral to the significance and future of our Organization.An institution  a community of men and women  can becreated by force — can  for a time  be maintained byforce — but it is not force that makes them last. The ideaof leadership is based on the ability to take decisions aswell as on moral authority. Moral authority is based on theability to convince the majority in a lasting and completeway. To be followed without conviction is to run the riskof abandonment as soon as short cuts can be safely taken.The joint aspiration of the States Members of theUnited Nations was  is and must remain that of followinga common path beneficial to all. It is no coincidence that inthe Charter  drafted at the end of a conflict in whichPowers imposed themselves on other Powers  spirit andletter came together so that States large and small couldfeel involved as much in the responsibilities and decision-making as in the outcome. Hence the principle of thesovereign equality of States  who assumed that  regardlessof their size or importance  each should participate to thebest of its ability in the functioning of the Organizationbecause  in this way  each worked equally to attain theprinciples and purposes of the Charter. Nor is it acoincidence that those which bore a greater burden in thisrespect were given a privilege in the Security Council though it was to be exercised on behalf of all and for thebenefit of all.What is happening nowadays? The United Nations isunique. It is political. Its role and its objectives are veryspecial. How can we  therefore  try to see it as a companywhose shareholders want to move it in a particular directionon the basis of the number of shares they hold? How couldwe continue to call ourselves United Nations? The UnitedNations has charge over destinies and people. It is also aninstitution that must be managed  but one in whicheveryone has a place.I have dwelt at length on this point because BurkinaFaso is a community of men that understands  appreciatesand supports the fact that the United Nations isirreplaceable. It is an instrument which has no equal andwe desire a world of fraternity and progress.Africa is fighting for its development  although besetby crises and conflicts  such as those in Liberia andBurundi. In Liberia  after the events of April 1996  thesummit meeting of the Committee of Nine and a certainopen-mindedness on the part of faction leaders calmed thesituation  permitted the nomination of a new Head ofState in the person of Ms. Ruth Perry  opened upprospects for the holding of elections. We encourage thistrend.In Burundi  a military coup d’état swept awaycivilian rule  but the fraternal States of the subregionrejected fait accompli by ordering sanctions. We aretherefore concerned by the situation in that country  whichhas already been traumatized by numerous ethnicconflicts. The international community should pay heedto that and provide resources.Turning to the subject of Taiwan  Burkina Fasowould refer to the principle of universality in the matterof representation of 22 million people. We hope that anad hoc committee will be established.Poverty is on the rise. It is the result of the policiesof the countries that control the markets. Poverty is alsothe consequence of unequal distribution among thedeveloping countries. In all cases  statements on bothsides very often sound like incantations crashing againstthe wall of cold implacable reality. The idea ofglobalization  paradoxically  goes hand in hand with thatof fragmentation  both political and economic. The worldconferences held over the past six years have promotedthe concept of partnership. We still need to give thatconcept real content and weight. Unfortunately  we stillpossess neither of these despite real efforts by somepartners of the North. Invective  tirades of complaint andexhortations have not advanced the debate nor brought uscloser to the right solutions.From 16 to 20 September 1996  we held the mid-term review of the United Nations New Agenda for theDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s. We thankAmbassador Owada and his country  Japan  for their3interest in the development of Africa. However  we mustacknowledge that the results of our negotiations with ourother partners continue to fall short of our expectations needs and priorities  although Africa has largely met itscommitments. The same goes for the mid-term reviewundertaken by the United Nations Children’s Fund on theoutcome of the World Summit for Children. Increasedresources are necessary and expected.Self-control is the beginning of wisdom  but it is notenough without an enabling environment. From thediscussions in the Uruguay Round to the creation of theWorld Trade Organization  this point is constantly beingborne out. Solidarity  the key word  must prevail and guideour actions if we want a global village  not just a seriesof enclaves that are more or less fortunate and in the longrun condemned to mutual destruction.Multilaterlism could prevent that fate  especiallysince we are now seeing that the State is surrenderingcontrol over certain elements of its sovereignty.Everywhere  structures and organizations with varyingdegrees of legality are transcending States andestablishing transnational networks and relations. It istherefore imperative that we keep pace with these trendsand adapt now and in the future our special instrument our common instrument: the United Nations at the serviceof peoples. Political will is what will make the difference."
"16",631,"BGD",51,1996,"﻿Mr. President  pleaseaccept our heartfelt congratulations on the assumption ofyour high office. Your unanimous election is a tribute toyour great country  with which we enjoy friendly andfraternal relations. It is also a testimony to your diplomaticskills and personal standing in this world forum  where  onso many occasions  you have articulated most persuasivelythe concerns of the international community  particularlythose of the marginalized and vulnerable. You are assuredof the unstinting support of my delegation in the dischargeof your very heavy responsibilities.I should like to convey to your predecessor  thePresident of the General Assembly at its historic fiftiethsession  His Excellency Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral  ourappreciation for a job well done.I should also like to pay a special tribute to ourSecretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali. In a veryreal sense  he is the first Secretary-General of the post-cold-war period  and has had to contend with issues andproblems that were perhaps furthest from the minds andintentions of the founding fathers of our Organization. Tohis high office he has brought to bear clarity of visionand purpose  and a remarkable ability — as we have seenfrom two seminal reports  on the Agenda for Peace andthe Agenda for Development — to present complexanalyses and facts in a simple  distilled form. For nearlyhalf a decade  he has handled what was once described byone of his predecessors as “the most impossible job onthis earth” with verve  dignity and integrity.Over two decades ago  the father of our nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman  addressed theGeneral Assembly at its twenty-ninth session  soon afterBangladesh’s entry into the United Nations as a fully-fledged Member. In his speech he outlined some cardinaltenets  the basic focus and thrust of our foreign policy and our domestic priorities. These hold good even today in a world that has undergone radical transformation. AsBangabandhu stated  our foreign policy is based on theprinciples of peaceful coexistence and friendship towardsall.Our political party  the Awami League  has onlyrecently been returned to office  through the process ofgeneral elections  after a gap of more than 20 years. Aswas stressed by our leader at the twenty-ninth session ofthe General Assembly  our total commitment to peace isborn of the realization that only in an environment ofpeace can our people concentrate their energies andresources in combating the scourges of poverty  hunger disease  illiteracy and unemployment that still beset alarge proportion of humankind. We naturally place specialimportance and emphasis on the development of good-neighbourly relations with the countries of our region  onthe basis of universally accepted principles of peacefulcoexistence  mutual respect for sovereignty and territorialintegrity and non-interference in each other’s internalaffairs. We identify wholeheartedly with the aspirationsand hopes of developing countries in general  particularlythose belonging to the Non-Aligned Movement  and sharea special affinity with the fraternal member States of theOrganization of the Islamic Conference (OIC). We sharewith our development partners the goal of improving thequality of life of our people  and our relations with themare of the greatest significance to us.5The existence of friendly and good-neighbourlyrelations does not necessarily preclude the emergence ofproblems. What these can ensure  however  is that the bestof political will  goodwill and good intentions are broughtto bear in seeking solutions to any outstanding problems orany new ones that may arise. Such an approach would goa long way towards resolving any differences or disputes.Our outstanding problem with India over the sharingof the waters of the Ganges River is not unknown to thisforum. Water resources play a predominant role in thesocio-economic development of a country. For Bangladesh the availability of fresh river water in adequate volumes isindispensable for purposes of agriculture  irrigation fisheries  river traffic  maintaining ecological andenvironmental balance and preventing the intrusion ofsalinity. The importance that we attach to this issue cannotbe overemphasized and we have resumed bilateraldiscussions with India  in an atmosphere of mutualconfidence and trust  to resolve this vexed problemamicably and equitably so that our legitimate concerns canbe met.On the subject of water resources  I should like todigress a little from the purely national and also bilateralcontext  because the shortage of fresh water resources isnot  let me emphasize  unique or peculiar to Bangladesh orour region. Even from the international perspective  it is anissue of primal significance. According to a recent strategypaper of the Committee on Natural Resources of theEconomic and Social Council  by the year 2025  52countries with a total population of more than 3 billionpeople will be water-stressed or face chronic water scarcity.The problem has as much to do with the availability offresh water in the overall global context as with the factthat such resources  even when available in abundantquantities  may be found in the wrong places or areavailable at the wrong times. The problem  therefore  isintimately and intricately linked to efficient watermanagement.The question of water is not new to the global agendaand  since the Mar del Plata Conference in March of 1977 there have been international programmes on water-relatedissues. It has not  however  in our view  received thepriority that it deserves. An international code of conductfor water-sharing was provided for in the Mar del PlataAction Plan and  as the strategy paper of the Committee onNatural Resources suggests  an international code of waterethics is needed more urgently today than ever before as aguide to help countries in their efforts to reach bilateral andmultilateral agreements. The paper also suggests aninternational convention on freshwater resources along thelines of those that already exist on biodiversity  ozonedepletion and climate change. In particular  the paperstresses that the United Nations should develop principlesand ethics on sharing the joint planetary freshwaterresources. These are ideas that  in our view  warrantserious consideration by the world community.Reverting to the subject of our Government’spriorities  let me just add that  in the domestic sphere  likeall other developing countries  we are striving for ahuman development paradigm that will prioritize people especially the most vulnerable and disadvantaged sectors.We will pursue a programme of reforms with emphasison our domestic considerations: poverty alleviation andeconomic growth with social justice. The social sectorswill receive special attention.The 1990s has been a period of democratic renewal.Our Government firmly believes that it is as important and perhaps more difficult  to live up to great principlesand ideas as to fight for their realization. That is why weshall strive to strengthen our polity through institutionsand laws.Through constitutional amendment  an importantinnovation for democratic institutions and practice waseffected in Bangladesh  following overwhelming populardemand  prior to our general elections in June. Threemonths before general elections are to be held  theGovernment will demit office and hand over power to anon-partisan and neutral caretaker Government to beheaded by the most recently retired Chief Justice of thecountry and comprised of eminent apolitical personalitiesappointed on his advice  keeping in mind the sensitivitiesof the major political parties. The principal mandate ofthe caretaker Government will be to ensure free and fairgeneral elections to be conducted by an independentconstitutional authority  the Election Commission. Foreignobservers were welcome to observe the electoral process completely unhindered  in 1996 and 1991. Reportssubmitted by international observers can be of help inidentifying any shortcomings or gaps that may exist andalso contain constructive suggestions for improvement.These steps are the national equivalents of confidence-building measures between and among States.Democracy  of course  goes well beyond the holdingof periodic general elections. It is a continuous processand even a culture and ethos  which above all denote acertain approach and attitude to governance. We inBangladesh see democracy as more than a laudable and6desirable objective. In the long term  democratic andaccountable government affords the most efficacious andstable medium to develop the economy of a State and toachieve prosperity for its people. The very apposite pointhas been made  however  that democracy cannot on its ownbe a panacea for the diverse problems that confront manycountries. There must also be effective internationalcooperation and a supportive external economicenvironment if the major socio-economic problems are tobe meaningfully addressed.The cold war is now truly behind us and the objectnow is to win the peace. Peace is not simply the absence ofwar  but should encompass every human condition necessity and amenity that make for a civilized anddignified life. It is inseparable from security and is the flipside of development. Political  economic and social issuesare today intimately and intricately intertwined. Politicalinternationalism without economic internationalism can onlybe likened to a house built upon sand. Most emphaticallyin this day and age of interdependence  no nation canachieve its fullest development alone. This is an area wherethe United Nations and the United Nations system clearlyhave a constructive role to play.The main purposes of the United Nations  as outlinedin Chapter I of the Charter  include the achievement ofinternational cooperation in solving international problemsof an economic  social  cultural or humanitarian characterand also to be a centre for harmonizing the actions ofnations in the attainment of these common ends.The Bretton Woods institutions are  of course  majorplayers in the field of development policy and research.There is also  in our view  a patent need and amplejustification in the Charter provisions for the United Nationsand the United Nations system to play a meaningful role inglobal macroeconomic policy and strategy formulation. TheUnited Nations is the universal forum for dialogue anddecisions on such issues. This is an area in which  inparticular  a revitalized Economic and Social Council canplay a constructive and fruitful role. While the UnitedNations economic role provides special focus onoperational  welfare and humanitarian activities  there iscertainly a need for greater harmony and coordinationbetween the United Nations systems on the one hand andthe Bretton Woods institutions on the other.On the subject of development  let me reaffirm that asupportive external environment is an indispensablesupplement to national efforts and policies. Poverty isarguably the prime source of world disorder and needs tobe addressed  inter alia  through sustained and enhancedflows of resources from the North to the countries of theSouth. The gap between North and South is widening atan ominous rate. In 1890  the wealth of each Europeanwas twice that of a South Asian. Today  the gap is 70-fold. In 1960  the per capita gross national product of therichest 20 per cent of States was 30 times higher than thatof the poorest 20 per cent. By 1989  the gap had widenedto 60 times. By 1994  only four countries members of theDevelopment Assistance Committee (DAC) had reachedthe United Nations target of 0.7 per cent of gross nationalproduct as official development assistance. The averagefigure for DAC countries actually fell from 0.31 per centin 1993 to 0.30 per cent in 1994. The least developedcountries’ share of world trade has plummeted in twodecades from 0.8 per cent to a mere 0.4 per cent.The problems of the 48 least developed countriescontinue to deserve special consideration on the globaldevelopment agenda. The Mid-term Global Review of theProgramme of Action for the Least Developed Countriesfor the 1990s has pointed to the limited progress made inthe implementation of commitments by our developmentpartners. The development initiatives of the least-developed countries are stunted by problems associatedwith formidable structural adjustment programmes  thedecline of an already low level of development resources and the extremely low level of exports compounded bylimited market access. The debt-relief measures taken thusfar have remained grossly inadequate. We urge ourdevelopment partners to adopt specific and concretemeasures to redress these problems. We welcome thestatements of several delegations that asked the removalof barriers on the products of the least developedcountries. We believe that  at the forthcoming MinisterialMeeting of the World Trade Organization in December every participant will work to remove all obstacles totrade from this vulnerable group of countries.The problems of developing countries are also  atone remove  the problems of the whole world  becauseprosperity  like peace and stability  is in the final analysisindivisible. For developed countries  assistance to thecountries of the South will surely constitute an investmentin a more secure  stable and  I have no doubt  eventuallyprosperous third world. The marginalization of developingcountries would be morally indefensible  politically self-defeating and economically counter-productive. Theaspirations of the South and the prosperity of the Northare emphatically not mutually exclusive.7As the first United Nations Secretary-General put it the United Nations was as strong an Organization as therepresentatives in San Francisco could agree upon. Half acentury later  the United Nations remains the indispensablelinchpin of any international order  a role for which it isuniquely conditioned  equipped and mandated. I should liketo stress here that an effective and credible United Nationsis even more vital and relevant for the smaller and morevulnerable States than for the more powerful ones.In today’s vastly altered world  the United Nations andits system offer even broader promise than what itsfounding fathers could have envisioned. However  like allorganizations  the United Nations system is also subject tothe Darwinian dictum of “adapt or perish”. Much thought effort and work are therefore being devoted to the goal ofmaking the United Nations more attuned and responsive tochanging times and requirements  charting its future courseand defining its new emphases and priorities.The United Nations areas of responsibility shouldclearly cover problems or issues between States  especiallythose that are pandemic in range and global in consequence.Environmental degradation  human rights  burgeoningpopulations  the situation and rights of women and children the depletion of non-renewable natural resources  drugs migration  international terrorism and corruption ininternational business could very well — in addition toissues of international peace  security and development —be the topical objects of United Nations policies andactions. We would  of course  want a United Nations thatis streamlined and focused  open and accountable  withprofessional management systems and structures.On the subject of Security Council reform  a numberof proposals have been mooted  including a wide-rangingone by Italy. There is a broad convergence  if notconsensus  on the idea that the overall size of an expandedCouncil should not exceed a figure in the low or mid-twenties. An agreement as to whether expansion shouldcover only the non-permanent category or both categoriesof seats  or could even include a new semi-permanentcategory  still continues to elude us. It is our view thatthree aspects of the issue should be given priority.Firstly  the smaller and the more vulnerable States thatby definition pose no threat to international security havethe most vital stakes in the United Nations. Their interestsand concerns may not be overlooked in any restructuring ofthe Council. Experience also shows that smaller countrieswith no vested interests have played a more constructiverole as Council members in general.Secondly  the objective of any reform andrestructuring should be a more effective and dynamicCouncil. Nothing should be allowed to detract from this.Thirdly  the moral dimension in determining criteriafor possible new categories of membership or for anyaddition to permanent ranks should be given dueconsideration. This would include a country’scommitment to the principles and purposes of the Charter to democratic government and the essential freedoms human rights and  in general  respect for United Nationsdecisions.The Secretary-General is the most visible symboland personification of the United Nations and the UnitedNations system. We see him as something more than thechief administrative officer of the Organization  asstipulated in the Charter  because he also has importantpolitical responsibilities. A former Secretary-General wasof the view that the Secretary-General should be of helpin“filling any vacuum that may appear in the systemswhich the Charter and traditional diplomacy providefor the safeguarding of peace and security”.While efforts are being made to enhance theeffectiveness of the General Assembly  the SecurityCouncil and the operational arms of the United Nationssystem  we could perhaps consider ways of strengtheningthe office of Secretary-General. One idea that we wouldcommend for consideration is the establishment of acommittee  along the lines of the General Committee ofthe General Assembly  that the Secretary-General couldconsult  formally or informally  collectively or byindividual member  on important administrative andpolitical issues. Such a committee would serve usefulpurposes  particularly in ensuring the rightful role of theGeneral Assembly.First  it would ensure closer interaction and exchangebetween the Secretary-General and the General Assembly.Secondly  it would provide the Secretary-General thebenefit of dispassionate counsel and a feel for thethinking of Member States on issues in an institutionalmanner. And  thirdly  it would make for greatertransparency in decision-making.The objective of any reform and restructuringexercise is a strengthened United Nations that isinstitutionally better equipped to fulfil its mandate.Reforms  however  can only supplement  not be a8substitute for the political will to do what is right andwarranted by the purposes and principles and otherprovisions of the Charter. Over the years  when the UnitedNations has floundered or failed  the predominant reasonswere more often  unfortunately  the lack of political willrather than insuperable local difficulties or institutionallacunas.I should like to touch very briefly upon the dismalfinancial situation of the United Nations  which has becomevery serious indeed. Member States have every right andeven a duty to demand the best value for their money. TheUnited Nations  however  must be provided the wherewithalto discharge its responsibilities. We welcome the UnitedStates commitment to meet its financial obligations to theUnited Nations and to pay its arrears over a five-yearperiod.Some interesting suggestions on United Nations reformhave emanated from the Group of Seven Summit in Lyonearlier this year. These envisage some savings from theremoval of overlap  improvement in the effectiveness ofsome agencies and commissions  and consolidation andrationalization of certain programmes. I have no doubt thatthe Fifth Committee and perhaps the Advisory Committeeon Administrative and Budgetary Questions will lookclosely at these proposals. We  of course  welcome thesuggestion that any savings from such reforms are plannedto be reinvested in development programmes.A more realistic perspective of the expendituresincurred by the United Nations is afforded by comparingthe United Nations budget with expenses incurred in certainactivities by national or even local Governments. Forexample  in 1992  the United Nations regular assessedbudget was about the size of the New York City FireDepartment budget. In 1994  the cost of the entire UnitedNations system  including all emergency operations  wasover $10 billion  or about $2 per capita of the planet’spopulation. The expenditure on arms in the same year wasabout $150 per capita.While every scope and avenue for greater cost-effectiveness should be explored  it is difficult to escape theconclusion that the United Nations gives good value formoney. Expenditures on peacekeeping and the UnitedNations system are in a real sense an investment in peaceand security.Disarmament has always been accorded a very highpriority in the United Nations. In particular  the question ofnuclear disarmament has always received the highestpriority. With the end of the cold war  there is anincreasing awareness of the need to address this issue inall earnestness. The indefinite extension of the Treaty onthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) last yearand the adoption of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-BanTreaty by an overwhelming majority in the GeneralAssembly are welcome steps towards the ultimate goal ofnuclear disarmament. The International Court of Justice in its recent Advisory Opinion on the issue of nuclearweapons  stressed the obligation“to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusionnegotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all itsaspects under strict and effective internationalcontrol”. (A/51/4  para. 182 (f))Like chemical and biological weapons  nuclearweapons must be outlawed. In the post-cold-war world they have became an anachronism. They do not enhanceinternational security and can only imperil world peace.For Bangladesh  the pursuit of general and completedisarmament is a fundamental principle of State policy.As a new member of the Conference on Disarmament  weare fully prepared to play a constructive role towards thisgoal. Bangladesh  together with most members of theG-21  has submitted a proposal in the Conference onDisarmament on the elimination of nuclear weapons. Thishas been circulated as a Conference on Disarmamentdocument. We accept that substantial reductions are beingmade under START I and START II in the nucleararsenals of the two major nuclear Powers. Theuncomfortable fact remains  however  that even afterSTART II is completed by the year 2003 at the latest there will still be more nuclear warheads in existence thanin 1970  when the NPT came into force. The need tomove speedily towards a third START treaty and beyondis very obvious.Peacekeeping continues to be a most significant areaof United Nations activity. The United Nations has indeedachieved some notable successes in peacekeepingmissions in recent times  examples of which include thosein El Salvador  Cambodia  Haiti  Mozambique andAngola. Bangladesh is proud to play an active role inUnited Nations peacekeeping activities. Our peacekeepershave shed their blood and sacrificed their lives in thecause of peace throughout the world.There is room for cautious optimism on the issue ofBosnia and Herzegovina. We sincerely hope that theDayton Agreement will be implemented in its entirety and9that a genuine peace will return to that beleaguered region.Bangladesh will continue to support all efforts towards thisobjective through regional as well as multilateral forums.Recent developments in the Middle East have been ofconcern to us all. Bangladesh expressed its grave concernand outrage at the recent violence and killings that tookplace in the West Bank and Gaza and the disrespect shownto the holy Al-Aqsa Mosque. We call upon all concernedto honour their commitments under the peace accord witha view to finding a comprehensive and lasting peace in theMiddle East  which Bangladesh believes will enable theemergence of a Palestinian State with Jerusalem as itscapital. The Government and the people of Bangladeshstand by President Yasser Arafat and our Palestinianbrethren. We also reaffirm our commitment and support tothe Arab and Palestinian cause.In a very real sense  the United Nations belongs to theentire human family. Over the years  it has been a potentmoral force and an influence for the good. It remains theonly credible vehicle that can move the world towards thegoal of international peace and prosperity. The institutionof the United Nations itself  comprised of Member Stateslarge and small  attests to mankind’s wisdom and desire forpeace. We have every confidence and hope that  in thecrucial years ahead  a revitalized United Nations willcontinue to play an effective role in deciding thetranscendent policy issues of the day.Differences between peoples  countries and nations canand do exist  and yet all share a common vision  hopes andaspirations. Good men and women all over the globe mustsurely dream the same dreams of lasting peace andhappiness.Over 50 years ago  a great world leader — one of thearchitects of the Atlantic Charter and one of the firstpersons to use the term “United Nations” — made animpassioned plea for peace when he wrote:“We are faced with the pre-eminent fact that ifcivilization is to survive  we must cultivate the scienceof human relationship — the ability of peoples of allkinds to live together and work together in the sameworld at peace.”President Roosevelt did not live to speak those words which he wrote for what would have been his last address.His words are surely relevant even today."
"17",677,"BGR",51,1996,"﻿A year ago this month  theGeneral Assembly adopted by acclamation the Declarationon the Occasion of the Fiftieth Anniversary of the UnitedNations. Thus  the special commemorative session of theAssembly  attended by 128 Heads of State andGovernment  solemnly reaffirmed our commitment to thepurposes and principles of the Charter. As AmbassadorButler of Australia  the Chairman of the PreparatoryCommittee  stated  that Declaration must serve as a set ofguidelines for cooperation amongst all nations in the yearsahead.The fiftieth session  so ably presided over byMr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral of Portugal  took the initialstep towards translating these new guidelines into practicalaction aimed at the twenty-first century. In congratulatingMr. Razali Ismail upon his election to the presidency of theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-first session  I wish him everysuccess in his highly responsible mission to carry furtherthe new tasks and endeavours of the Organization in thecourse of this session.Last year’s Declaration spelt out four main areas foraction in fulfilment of the mission of the United Nations inthe coming decades: peace  development  equality andjustice. The world of the twenty-first century will confronttwo great opposing forces: globalization and fragmentation.Bulgaria  as an active member of the internationalcommunity  has felt both the new opportunities and the newrisks. In developing its policies and responses  Bulgaria hasproceeded on the basis of its European identity  particularlyits association with and prospective membership of theEuropean Union. I would therefore like to state that weshare in and attach importance to the European Unionmemorandum to this session and to the statement deliveredby Mr. Dick Spring on behalf of the Union.With the transition from the post-war bipolar systemto a world of multi-centrism  the regional format willacquire ever-growing importance. This has been ourexperience in the Balkans  at least  a region which hassustained the full blast of the forces of both globalizationand disastrous fragmentation.In line with its consistently maintained positions Bulgaria welcomed from the outset the Dayton and Parisagreements. We provided observers as well as policepersonnel to the international missions in Bosnia andHerzegovina. The recent elections in that country notwithstanding their deficiencies and problems  representa vitally important step forward. They opened the way foryesterday’s welcome and important Security Councilresolution to lift the sanctions imposed on Yugoslavia.At the same time  even during the active phase ofthe conflict  we have worked for the promotion of thepositive trends of good-neighbourliness throughout theregion. At last year’s fiftieth session  the Prime Ministerof Bulgaria highlighted this priority feature of Bulgaria’sforeign policy  favouring comprehensive regionalcooperation. In particular he stated our intention toconvene a meeting of Central and South-East EuropeanStates in order to examine a broad range of issuesconcerning long-term stability  security and cooperationthroughout the region.Today  it is my pleasure to inform the Assembly thatsuch a meeting took place in Sofia on 6 and 7 July 1996at foreign ministerial level. At that meeting  sevencountries — Albania  Bosnia and Herzegovina  Bulgaria Greece  Romania  Turkey and Yugoslavia — adopted acomprehensive document  the Sofia Declaration on Good-Neighbourly Relations  Stability  Security andCooperation in the Balkans.The text of the Declaration was duly circulated as anofficial document of the General Assembly and theSecurity Council. The Declaration was fully supported byall participants in the broader format of the Sofiaministerial meeting  including representatives fromCroatia  Slovenia  Italy  Hungary  and the five ContactGroup countries — Germany  France  the RussianFederation  the United Kingdom and the United States ofAmerica; Ireland  which holds the presidency of theEuropean Union; representatives of countries chairing theOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe(OSCE)  the Central European Initiative  Black Sea11Economic Cooperation; and high-level representatives fromthe United Nations  the European Commission  the Councilof Europe  the United Nations Economic Commission forEurope  the World Bank and the European Bank forReconstruction and Development. The High Representative Mr. Carl Bildt  was also present  took part in the meetingand made a valuable contribution to its success.I should like to outline very briefly the main spheresof activity launched at the meeting in Sofia in July. In thefirst area — enhancing regional peace and stability  andbuilding confidence and good-neighbourliness — the pointof departure was for the countries in the region to reaffirmtheir allegiance to the fundamental principles of inter-Staterelations as spelt out by the Charter  as well as in Helsinkiand Paris.In line with these principles  Bulgaria has beenactively promoting confidence-building with all itsneighbours and has already concluded agreements to thiseffect with Turkey  Greece and Romania. We stand readyto enter into such agreements with our other neighbours  aswell as on a multilateral regional basis.Another important step in this direction will be theconvening in Sofia of a meeting of Ministers of Defence asprovided for in the Declaration of the Balkan countries.This meeting should contribute significantly towardsstrengthening security  enhancing confidence andconsidering future arms-control measures in the region.Recent regional multilateral cooperation in South-EastEurope has focused on infrastructure development andupgrading as important factors for economic growth andregional stability. There is an emerging consensus that itshould be oriented towards upgrading and linking localinfrastructures with trans-European ones  as well as withthose in other adjacent areas — the eastern Mediterranean northern Africa and across the Black Sea and into Asia.Transport infrastructure development is the subject of localcooperation between Albania  the Republic of Macedoniaand Bulgaria  with direct financial and technical assistancebeing provided by the United States of America; aquadrilateral agreement has recently been signed withregard to this matter. It is also the subject of trilateralcooperation between Greece  Bulgaria and Romania. Animportant contribution to the cause of good-neighbourlinessand infrastructure development are the Bulgarian-Greekcross-border cooperation and water-sharing agreements which recently entered into force and will be submitted tothe OSCE under the Pact on Stability in Europe.Furthermore  in accordance with the agreementbetween the Balkan countries  the Bulgarian Governmentbegan preliminary consultations towards setting up atransregional information and contacts centre forinfrastructure development. We expect furthercontributions to be made to the positive developments inthis field from the forthcoming meeting of Ministers ofTransportation of the Black Sea Economic Cooperationand Central European Initiative partner countries in Sofiain November 1996.Together with its neighbours in South-East Europe Bulgaria is building regional cooperation on the basis ofthe rule of law and full respect for human rights andfundamental freedoms  including those of personsbelonging to different national  ethnic  religious andcultural minorities. The countries from the region onceagain reaffirmed their commitment to these principles andvalues. They also adopted specific guidelines in thevarious areas of cultural contacts and cooperation throughexchanges and joint programmes. These should add toexisting bilateral or multilateral programmes that promotebetter mutual understanding and the overcoming ofnegative stereotypes inherited from the past.Joint action in the field of crime prevention and theelimination of international terrorism envisages closercooperation between central  regional and borderauthorities through efficient communications andexchange of information; a commitment to accede to allrelevant international conventions that prevent and punishinternational crime and terrorism; joining and participationin specialized regional forums for discussing the problemsof illicit drug-trafficking  organized crime and regionalanti-terrorist cooperation; and the elaboration of a regionalprogramme to combat organized crime. This alreadyrepresents a tangible contribution to the implementationat the regional level of a zero-tolerance approach toterrorism.The Sofia Declaration thus set out both theframework and the terms of reference for comprehensiveregional cooperation. To this end  follow-up activities arebeing elaborated in all areas and we hope that all Statesfrom the region will take part at the next ministerialmeeting in Greece in 1997.Proposals on cooperation in South-East Europe havealso come from outside the region. The Florenceconference of the Peace Implementation Council last Juneidentified the three initiatives fostering such cooperation:the Balkan conference initiated by the Bulgarian1Government  the stability process under the terms of theRoyaumont declaration of 12 December 1995 and theSouth-East Europe cooperation initiative of the UnitedStates Government. There is important potential forinteraction between the three initiatives  with the processlaunched in Sofia serving as a comprehensive basis whichcould link up with the other two initiatives in specific areasof common interest.This regional endeavour represents an integral buildingblock in the development of an all-European system ofsecurity and cooperation. We expect the Lisbon OSCEsummit in December 1996 to address in a comprehensivemanner this set of issues and provide guidelines for futureaction at both the European and regional levels. Variousbodies and agencies of the United Nations system  such asthe United Nations Economic Commission for Europe  theUnited Nations Development Programme  the UnitedNations Environment Programme  the Commission onNarcotic Drugs  the United Nations Crime Prevention andCriminal Justice Branch and other bodies could also behighly effective in encouraging and promoting at theregional level the ideas and initiatives that I have outlined.I would like to state Bulgaria’s position on someUnited Nations-led and other major endeavours at theglobal level. We fully share the view that the recentconclusion of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treatyis an achievement of truly historic proportions. In pursuit ofBulgaria’s long-standing policies in favour of nuclear armscontrol and disarmament  I had the honour to sign thisTreaty on the very first day it was opened for signature. ForBulgaria  a convention on the ban on the production offissionable material for military purposes would be the nextlogical stage in the work of the Conference onDisarmament  in which Bulgaria is an active participant.From the point of view of global as well as regionalsecurity  another priority task is the early entry into forceand implementation of the Chemical Weapons Convention.As for the Biological Weapons Convention  Bulgaria isfully in favour of upgrading its control and verificationmechanism and is ready to contribute to this end at theforthcoming Review Conference and thereafter.Bulgaria took an active part in the Review Conferenceof the States Parties to the Convention on Prohibitions orRestrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional WeaponsWhich May Be Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or toHave Indiscriminate Effects  and its Protocol II. During thenegotiations  we made special efforts to take intoconsideration the new technical requirements on mines asan absolute prerequisite for the purposes of mine-clearance and the normal conduct of United Nationspeacekeeping and humanitarian operations. Furthermore by a decision taken on 2 May 1996  the BulgarianGovernment imposed a three-year ban on exports of anti-personnel mines. Bulgaria  which currently hold thechairmanship of the Commission on SustainableDevelopment  attaches particular importance  togetherwith the other United Nations Member States  to thespecial session of the General Assembly on the review ofthe follow-up process to the United Nations Conferenceon Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro.In October 1995  Sofia hosted the third MinisterialConference on Environment for Europe. The Conferenceprovided further impetus to the Environmental ActionProgramme for Central and Eastern Europe. Theministerial declaration adopted is an important documentin the field of environmental protection in Europe and afurther step towards implementing the global concept ofsustainability.In recent years  we have witnessed rapid changes inthe world economy  changes that can be described by thegeneral trends of liberalization and globalization  both ofwhich are important factors for development. I am happyto inform this Assembly that  after long years ofstrenuous negotiations  today  2 October 1996  Bulgariais becoming a member of the World Trade Organization(WTO). By joining WTO  Bulgaria shall become fullyintegrated into the world trading system which is essentialfor us to be able to achieve stable economic growth.Bearing in mind the new challenges in the social andeconomic areas in today’s multipolar and interdependentworld  my country supports the efforts of the internationalcommunity to enhance and streamline United Nationsactivities in this field.Bulgaria is a party to all major international human-rights instruments. We believe that internationalcooperation in the field of human rights is essential fortheir implementation. It should be conducted inaccordance with the Charter of the United Nations and theprinciples of international law  such as the sovereignequality  political independence and the territorial integrityof States. We are in favour of constructive and opendialogue on even sensitive issues related to human rightsin individual States. This approach is not directed againstany country. The situations in different parts of the worldshould be examined in a way that takes into account thespecific characteristics of individual countries in a13comprehensive context and be aimed above all atencouraging positive developments and tendencies.Transnational crime and international terrorism areincreasingly emerging  as stated by many speakers in thisforum  as one of the major security challenges facing theinternational community today. They directly affectdevelopment and quality of life and erode the veryfoundations of democratic society. It has become more thanobvious that these challenges cannot be addressedeffectively by national institutions alone. Today  there is apressing need to develop new cooperation in the field ofcrime prevention and criminal justice. Such cooperationcould also include more information sharing  includinginputs from intelligence sources.At this session  the General Assembly must carefullyexamine all valuable ideas and proposals in this field putforward by preceding speakers. My country will readilysupport the efforts of the international community aimed atthe elaboration  on a global level  of efficient measures tocombat crime and to eliminate international terrorism.Allow me to digress for a moment from the preparedtext of my speech in order to share with the Assembly amost regrettable and tragic piece of news concerning apolitical assassination which took place just over 24 hoursago in Sofia. The target was a former Prime Minister ofBulgaria  Mr. Andrei Lukanov. I would like to inform theAssembly that Mr. Lukanov was one of the principal andpersonal driving forces behind the democratic changes thattook place in Bulgaria after 1989. He staked his personalefforts and future on the successful introduction intoBulgarian society of the values of democracy  thepromotion of human rights and economic reform. He wasalso well-known within the United Nations family  inparticular in Geneva  having been an active promoter of theUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Developmentsince its early years and having promoted Bulgaria’sparticipation in the world trading system and the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade. In an ironic twist of fate today marks  as I said  Bulgaria’s accession to WTO.The Bulgarian Parliament adopted a declaration on thisoccasion several hours ago. It firmly declares the will of allpolitical forces in Bulgaria — Mr. Lukanov having been anactive member of Parliament for the last seven years — notto permit this act in any way to divert Bulgaria from thepath towards economic and political reform or to infringeon the peaceful and lawful process of political and publiclife  including the forthcoming presidential elections at theend of this month.I have instructed my Mission to transmit the text ofthis declaration  with a short covering note  to you Mr. President  the Secretary-General and Member States.I invite all of you to share our feelings of support andsympathy for the family of Mr. Lukanov and to sendmessages of support to the Bulgarian Parliament. I invitethe Assembly  at this point in time  without rising  toshare a minute of silence in remembrance ofMr. Lukanov.Improvements in the effectiveness and functioning ofthe principal organs  a better balance in their authorityand the streamlining of the subsidiary machinery areimportant conditions for the reform of the United Nations.The issue of equitable representation on and increasein the membership of the Security Council is a keycomponent of this process. We share the view that someMember States — developed  for instance Germany andJapan  and developing alike — are able to assume theresponsibility of permanent membership. A number ofproposals for the reform of the Security Council havealready been put on the table and should be examinedwith due attention. In this respect  I would like to mentionthe valuable ideas presented by Minister Lamberto Diniof Italy just a few days ago. One of the majordevelopments over the past several years has been the factthat the number of States in the Eastern European Grouphas almost doubled. We reiterate our conviction that sucha rise in membership requires one additional non-permanent seat to be allocated to this Group. SomeBalkan countries have already indicated their willingnessto apply for non-permanent membership in the SecurityCouncil. With its consistent regional policies of good-neighbourliness and cooperation in South-East Europe  aswell as in the broader United Nations framework Bulgaria is equally justified in seeking membership on theCouncil in the years to come.It would be remiss of me  however  not to mentionsome serious flaws in the United Nations peacemakingmachinery. The question of finding an adequate solutionto the complicated problems arising for third countries asa result of United Nations Security Council-imposedsanctions is one of them. At its fiftieth session theGeneral Assembly once again expressed concern at thepersisting special economic problems confronting Statesaffected by sanctions implementation. It also renewed itsinvitation to the international financial institutions tocontinue to pay special attention to these problems andtheir adverse social impact  and to consider ways and14means for mobilizing and providing resources onappropriate terms for mitigating the negative impact of thesanctions on those States. The Assembly also renewed itsrequest to the competent organs  programmes andspecialized agencies of the United Nations to take intoconsideration the special needs of the affected States and toconsider providing assistance to them from their specialprogramme resources.Regrettably  few are the practical steps inimplementing these recommendations. These problems since they are long-lasting  will continue to exert theirnegative impact long after the lifting of sanctions. It wouldbe highly counterproductive if the peacemaking essence ofsanctions were to be distorted by major economicdislocation in affected third States. Being among thecountries suffering most from the implementation ofsanctions  at this session Bulgaria will again submit a draftresolution on the subject and I invite all Member States togive it their unanimous and firm support.The proceedings of the fifty-first session of theGeneral Assembly provide new  important opportunities tocontinue on the path of reform and increased efficiency.They open up new opportunities to render support to thosetrends in the modern world  our global village and each ofits neighbourhoods  making for societies with greatersecurity and promise in which our children can lookforward to a more fulfilling life. Bulgaria is firmlycommitted to contributing actively and in a constructivespirit to the accomplishment of this new mission of theworld Organization."
"18",722,"BHR",51,1996,"﻿At the outset  I have the pleasure of extending toMr. Razali Ismail and to his friendly country  Malaysia my sincere congratulations on his election as President ofthe General Assembly at its fifty-first session. I wish himsuccess in conducting the proceedings of the session andassure him of my delegation’s readiness to cooperate fullywith him in achieving our Organization’s objectives andpurposes.I also take this opportunity to express my thanks andappreciation to his predecessor  Mr. Diogo Freitas doAmaral  for his sincere efforts in guiding the proceedingsof the previous session.It is also my pleasure to express my country’sgratitude and appreciation to the Secretary-General Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for his tireless and dedicatedefforts to enhance the Organization’s role and standing17and to further the Charter’s objectives  especially thoserelated to the maintenance of world peace and security. Ihope that he will continue to hold this important positionand to do this good work.This session convenes a year after the fiftiethanniversary of the United Nations  which was celebrated inthe middle of a decade that has  from the start  witnessedrapid changes and diverse trends arising from the remnantsof the cooperation and cold-war conflict that have markedhalf a century.The international community has dealt with thechallenges this historic burden with a twofold response.First  it has sought to reform and develop the UnitedNations system so as to enable it to fulfil its role in thelight of these changes. Secondly  it has made concertedefforts by convening world conferences to deal with criticalissues relating to the future of mankind  such as theenvironment  development  population  trade  socialdevelopment  women and children. Despite these efforts which have continued for several years  this twofoldresponse has proved woefully inadequate to alleviate the illsthat have slowed the progress and political  economic andsocial development of the human race.Given the way the United Nations was established andthe manner in which the international system has evolvedsince the 1940s  this phenomenon should not come as asurprise. The international community has been unable toabsorb the intense impact of the major transformations ofthe present decade  which have relied heavily on thefoundations and parameters of the current system ofinternational relations. This means that the internationalcommunity still needs some time — not necessarily alittle — in which to fathom the similarities and diversitiesof national interests that influence the contemporaryinternational political system.In order to be able to understand these politicalramifications in their historical context  we must considerthis phenomenon in the context of the flexibility andinflexibility that characterize the structure of thecontemporary system of international relations. That isbecause the crisis afflicting current international politicalrelations has been caused largely by the persistence ofcomplex political and historical dilemmas that havecontinued to interact within a system of internationalrelations based on visions formulated by the allies beforethe end of the Second World War.The Powers that are influential in the internationalarena presently appear to be reviewing the basis on whichthe present international system was founded  with a viewto reconfiguring  rather than abolishing  current and futureglobal imperatives. The underlying purpose of the systemthat emerged in the 1940s was fundamentally to addressregional and international security problems in all theirpolitical and economic dimensions. It is a fact that theAllied Powers formulated their vision in the 1940s on thepremise that security and stability in the regional contextwere basically associated with the creation of a number ofinternational institutions  most notably the United Nations its specialized agencies and the financial institutions thatcame into being as a result of agreements reached at anumber of historic conferences.Despite this association and the new intellectual political and economic trends brought about by thechanges  the structural notions of the international systemhave not developed in tandem with the requirements ofhuman development  as manifested by thecommunications revolution  the exchange of ideas  theflow of information and the technological applicationsthat have influenced international relations in variousways.The historical concept of the link between nationaland regional security could serve as an appropriatestarting point for a comprehensive review and redefinitionof the question of security in all its aspects. In spite ofthe importance of the administrative and financial reformof the United Nations  its specialized agencies and otherorgans  the influential Powers have not given the questionof collective security adequate attention with a view todeveloping ways and means to preserve internationalpeace and security.The international community truly must expand thescope of the principle of collective security if States areto be free from the fear of strategic threats to theirnational and regional security. It is my conviction that theSecurity Council  as the sensory nerve-centre of theUnited Nations  in addressing the questions of worldsecurity  should be guided by certain collective securityprinciples that could be activated in the currentcircumstances. Furthermore  it is possible to increase theuse of practical preventive diplomacy to prevent theeruption of conflicts by containment and by speedilyeliminating their causes.In view of the importance now being attached to thequestion of collective security  thought should be given to18the development of mechanisms for maintaining relationsbetween the Security Council and regional organizations  inaccordance with United Nations purposes and principles.This is relevant to some particularly important regions ofthe world  such as the Arabian Gulf region  which isafflicted by tensions that threaten the establishedfundamentals of the region’s security.To insure the region’s security and stability  it isimperative that relations among all States of the region bebased on the principles of good-neighbourliness  mutualrespect  non-interference in the internal affairs of others andrecognition of every State’s national sovereignty. Theterritorial and border claims that are currently being madein the Arabian Gulf region  and are aimed at changingestablished and traditionally accepted boundaries  upset thesecurity and stability of the region. We believe that theoptimal and most judicious course for avoiding thatprospect is to respect the status quo  refrain from anyclaims — total or partial — and to settle any consequentialdifferences by peaceful means acceptable to the parties tothe dispute.With regard to the situation between Iraq and Kuwait the State of Bahrain  being keen to maintain security andstability in the Gulf region  stresses the need for Iraq tomeet fully the requirements of international legality andfulfil its obligations under the relevant Security Councilresolutions  including the release of Kuwaiti and otherprisoners of war.While it asserts that care should be given to ensuringthe unity  sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq Bahrain welcomes the signing of the memorandum ofunderstanding between Iraq and the United Nations andcalls for the accelerated implementation of Security Councilresolution 986 (1995) on the issue of “oil for food”  anessential step towards alleviating the suffering of thebrotherly Iraqi people.On another matter  the continued occupation by theIslamic Republic of Iran of the three islands of GreaterTunb  Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa — all of which belongto the United Arab Emirates — is a cause of concern forBahrain and other member States of the Gulf CooperationCouncil  in view of the serious ramifications for thesecurity and stability of the region and good-neighbourlyrelations among its States.The State of Bahrain therefore calls upon the IslamicRepublic of Iran to respond urgently to the appeals of theUnited Arab Emirates to solve the question of these islandsthrough serious bilateral talks and other means availablefor the peaceful settlement of disputes throughreconciliation among States.Economic security is also fundamental to a world ofsecurity and peace. In recent years  significantdevelopments have taken place in the sphere ofinternational economic relations as a result of theinterdependence that has come to characterize the worldeconomy  especially since the establishment of the WorldTrade Organization. Over the past four decades  theUnited Nations has addressed development problems issued a number of declarations and formulated a numberof strategies in this respect  but the desired results havebeen elusive.We believe that development challenges to anycountry can be met only by taking into account the globaleconomic system as a solution that involves thedevelopment of a comprehensive framework combininginternational and local efforts  with a view to improvingthe performance of the economy in a favourableenvironment wherein local and regional circumstances andthe priorities and special conditions of each individualState are taken into consideration.The topic of the ninth session of the United NationsConference on Trade and Development  held this year inSouth Africa  was the promotion of sustainable growthand development in the context of the globalization andliberalization of the world economy. This reflects a globalinterest in addressing the shortcomings of the worldeconomy. In this connection  we would like to emphasizethe importance of the role of the Organization in theenhancement of solidarity and interdependence for thesake of promoting development in all countries.With regard to the Second United NationsConference on Human Settlements  held at Istanbul thisyear  it is our hope that the principles  commitments andplan of action of the Conference will be implemented. Itis also our hope that the World Food Summit  to be heldin November in Rome  will make recommendations toensure and enhance world food security.Environmental problems continue to be a cause ofconcern for the human race in view of their potentialthreat to our planet. Agenda 21  adopted at the UnitedNations Conference of Environment and Development  isa framework for the protection of the environment.Persuaded that collective action is important for theprotection of the environment  the State of Bahrain has19paid special attention to the issue of the environment.Accordingly  an Emir’s decree approving Bahrain’saccession to the Convention on Biological Diversity andanother on environmental law were issued. The latterestablishes an environmental body that can exercise allauthorities with respect to environmental planning andpolicies and the supervision of their implementation.The third element  in our view  is social security without which societies would be unable to sustain humanprogress or protect national security. As far as the peopleare concerned  it is an important precondition for theachievement and preservation of peace and security withinand among States. This fact was stressed by the WorldSummit for Social Development  held in Copenhagen lastyear.Responsibility for social development is based on twopivotal factors: national responsibility and collectivecommitment  as reflected in the combined efforts of theinternational community. In this connection  it must bementioned that the ability of societies to effect socialdevelopment is fundamentally connected to the objectivesof economic progress and comprehensive development inall their human dimensions. Any international commitmentto preserve the stability and security of societies within theframework of economic and social development should takeinto consideration the cultural content of social developmentand the various national factors.The State of Bahrain — in the light of its convictionthat peace in the region is a strategic alternative that mustinevitably be based on justice  the restoration of rights andthe prevalence of security — follows closely and with deepconcern the new developments in the Middle East peaceprocess. Peace is the only course that can lead toreconstruction  prosperity and the well-being of the peoplesof the region. It can end the cycle of violence and warwhich the region has suffered for so long.The progress achieved in the context of the MadridConference  whose underlying principles were theachievement of a just  comprehensive and lasting peace inaccordance with international legality and the principle of“land for peace”  should continue without regression. Wemust build on it.The State of Bahrain views with deep concern theserious events that have taken place in the past few days asa result of the policies of the present Israeli Government.These are manifest in its perpetuation of the occupation andits refusal to honour the agreements made and to withdrawfrom occupied Arab territories in Palestine  the SyrianGolan Heights and southern Lebanon  as provided for inGeneral Assembly and Security Council resolutions  inparticular resolutions 242 (1967)  338 (1973) and 425(1978)  as well as in the Madrid terms of reference whose underlying principle is “land for peace”.We call upon the international community  inparticular the two sponsors of the peace process  and theStates of the European Community to persuade Israel toend its repressive practices against the Palestinian peopleand to resume negotiations on the final status of thePalestinian territories in accordance with the agreementsconcluded between the two parties. They should alsostress the necessity of resuming negotiations on the Syrianand Lebanese tracks. These negotiations should aim atachieving just  comprehensive and lasting peace in theregion and at insuring the attainment by the Palestinianpeople of their legitimate rights. These include their rightto establish their own independent State  with Jerusalemas its capital  and the complete withdrawal of Israel fromall Arab territories  including the occupied Syrian GolanHeights up to the boundaries of 4 June 1967 and occupiedsouthern Lebanon.Without doubt  in violating the principles uponwhich the peace process is based  reneging on theagreements and commitments reached within theframework of this process and procrastinating in theimplementation thereof  Israel will drastically set back thepeace process and lead the region back into a new cycleof tension and violence.It is regrettable that Israel continues periodically toact repressively against the Palestinian people andrepeatedly to violate the sanctity of Islamic holy places.We denounce the Israeli authorities’ opening of a tunnelbeneath Islamic archaeological sites. This is calculated tojudaize and efface the Islamic features of the occupiedPalestinian territories. This act has caused indignation andanger in the occupied Palestinian territories in particularand in the Islamic world in general. It is a hostile actdirected against the holy Islamic sites and a provocationagainst the sentiments of Arabs and Muslims.In condemning Israeli practices and repressiveactions  which have resulted in scores of deaths andhundreds of injuries  we demand that Israel end thesepractices and forswear its plans to change the Arab andIslamic character of the city of Jerusalem or to violate thesanctity of the Holy Al-Aqsa Mosque. We call upon theinternational community to urge and pressure the Israeli0Government to renounce political policies of expansion andsettlement in Arab territories and to comply with therequirements of peace and security in the region.We consider the conclusion of the ComprehensiveNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty to be one of the most importantissues in the field of disarmament. We look forward to theday when we can feel secure because all nuclear tests havebeen ended and all nuclear weapons eliminated. Bahraintherefore signed the Treaty last week because it considersit a step in the right direction of eliminating these weapons.The elimination of all weapons of mass destruction isbound to enhance confidence and security at both theinternational and regional levels. We have supported theinitiatives seeking to make the Middle East  including theArabian Gulf region  a zone free of nuclear weapons andweapons of mass destruction. Bahrain has done so in thedeep conviction that the security and stability of the regionshould be maintained  that the region should be saved fromthe calamity of these weapons of mass destruction and thatthe States of the region should be able to implementdevelopment projects and raise the standard of living oftheir peoples. In this connection  I would like to applaudthe signing of the Pelindaba Treaty in Cairo on 11 April1996  which established Africa as a Nuclear-Weapon-FreeZone.Terrorism in all forms is a global phenomenon whosethreat today is not confined to a particular people or region but endangers security and peace in numerous countries.Bahrain has repeatedly denounced and deplored thisdangerous phenomenon in more than one internationalforum. Its eradication requires cooperation and thecoordination of efforts. Bahrain now calls for concertedefforts for the implementation of the Declaration onMeasures to Eliminate International Terrorism  adopted atthe forty-ninth session of the General Assembly. It alsocalls for cooperation in the identification of terroristactivities  their prosecution  the adoption of deterrentmeasures and preventing terrorist organizations from usingthe territories  information media and facilities available byvirtue of the respect given to civil liberties in certaincountries  in order to mount hostile activities against othercountries.The State of Bahrain would like to express itsgratitude and appreciation to the sisterly and friendly Statesthat lent their support at a time when it was the target offoreign-aided terrorist acts aimed at disturbing the securityand stability enjoyed by our State and other Arabian GulfStates. The events witnessed in the State of Bahrain andother States in the region and throughout the worlddemonstrate the extent of the danger of terrorism and howfar the terrorist elements can go in manipulating laws andinternational human-rights principles to serve their ownsubversive and terrorist ends.The fighting in Somalia and Afghanistan has broughtdevastation and destruction to the peoples of the twocountries. With a view to sparing the lives of innocentpeople  we appeal anew to all parties to the conflict ineach of the two Islamic countries to embark on a seriousdialogue to reach a political settlement of theirdifferences.We welcome the outcome of the elections that tookplace in Bosnia and Herzegovina within the framework ofthe Peace Agreement signed in Paris as a result ofnegotiations held in Dayton in 1995.We support all efforts to restore peace and stabilityin Bosnia and Herzegovina  urge respect for theindependence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of thatcountry and emphasize the necessity of economicreconstruction and rehabilitation as a means to buttressthe peace process.With regard to the question of Cyprus  we call uponthe United Nations to continue its contacts with theparties concerned so that direct talks can be resumed witha view to reaching a final settlement.The question of the development and reform of theUnited Nations is in the forefront of issues that havecaptured the attention of Member States. Extensivediscussions on this matter have taken place over the pastfew years  especially in relation to the question ofequitable representation on the Security Council. It is ourview that the reform of the Security Council is not onlya matter of institutional dimensions and ramifications  butthat it also constitutes a challenge that the internationalcommunity should address thoughtfully.The State of Bahrain has consistently supported theSecurity Council and its role in and contribution to themaintenance of international peace and security. It hasalso joined the international community in theimplementation of resolutions relevant to internationallegality and related commitments. Bahrain is the hostcountry for the Field Office of the Special Commissionestablished under Security Council resolution 687 (1991)and has provided the Office with all the facilities neededfor the successful performance of its duties. In this1respect  the State of Bahrain wishes to recall withappreciation the report of the Secretary-General on thework of the Organization  submitted to the GeneralAssembly at its current session  in which he praises thesupport given by the Government of Bahrain to theactivities and work of the Office.Since it joined this Organization  the State of Bahrainhas always adhered to the principles and purposes of theCharter of the United Nations and therefore looks forwardto playing a more active role in this regard. The nominationof Bahrain to Security Council membership for the period1998-1999 — which received the unanimous endorsementof the Group of Asian States  the League of Arab Statesand the Gulf Cooperation Council and the support of otherMember States — is a confirmation of its standing as apeace-loving State and an indication that it wishes to playa more active role in the maintenance of world peace andsecurity.The characteristic distinction of the late twentiethcentury is that relations among nations are based oninterrelated  mutual and diverse interests in various political economic and social fields. This interrelatedness of interestshas formed a sort of common culture among nations andhas created a favourable climate for the exchange of ideasand the tools of knowledge  thus enabling cultural andintellectual interaction among peoples of the world andenhancing a deeper understanding of the bases of worldpeace and security  an objective which the United Nationshas sought to achieve over the past five decades.In view of this fact  it behooves us to lend theOrganization support and encouragement so that it may beable to play its role in a civilized world and carry out itsnoble tasks of ensuring the achievement of world security prosperity and peace."
"19",760,"BHS",51,1996,"﻿The Government of theCommonwealth of the Bahamas warmly congratulatesAmbassador Razali on his election to the presidency of thisfifty-first session of the General Assembly. His skills as adistinguished diplomat are well known and  coupled withthe cooperation of Member States  will create the requisiteconditions for a successful Assembly. I wish to assurehim of the full support of my delegation as he presidesover the deliberations of this body.I wish also to express my delegation’s appreciationto his predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Diogo Freitas doAmaral of Portugal  who effectively guided the work ofa most historic and memorable fiftieth session. We wishalso to thank the Secretary-General for his leadership ofthe Organization over the past year.The Bahamas is indeed honoured to have beenelected to serve as a Vice-President of the GeneralAssembly at the fifty-first session. I wish to thank allMember States for their support in our realization of thisachievement.Our deliberations during the last session provided anopportune environment for stocktaking and evaluation  aswell as the opportunity to look ahead and consider howwe ought to proceed for the next 50 years. The solemnDeclaration which we adopted at the end of the SpecialCommemorative Meeting  highlighted the internationalcommunity’s continued commitment to the UnitedNations and to the purposes and principles of the Charterby which it is governed. The Bahamas is convinced thatthe United Nations remains the primary world body withthe capacity and political will to bring together thedisparate elements of the international community  so asto face and deal with the challenges of the twenty-firstcentury.The Bahamas  like other countries  would wish tosee a strong and effective United Nations. It is our viewthat the three-tiered reform process currently under wayin the political  economic and social and administrativeareas represents an important step in that direction. Wemust remain diligent and focused in our work so as totransform the United Nations into a structure equipped forthe fulfilment and support of the myriad demands ofMember States.In the area of political reform  the Bahamascontinues to support the enlargement of the SecurityCouncil to enable it to become more effective representative  democratic and transparent. We aredisappointed that after another year of discussion little orno progress has been made. We urge all Member Statesto exercise flexibility so as to expedite agreement on thisimportant matter.1We acknowledge the need to strengthen the UnitedNations system in the economic and social fields. Actionmust be taken to reduce duplication and to improvecoordination among the various agencies  including theBretton Woods institutions.There is a clear need for reform and greater efficiencyin the administrative and financial areas. The discussions inthe respective high-level Working Groups established toexamine these areas have been useful. However  few  ifany  meaningful decisions have been taken to date. We urgeMember States to increase the momentum  so as to put inplace the requisite measures to strengthen the efficacy ofthe Organization. At the same time  the Bahamas urges andappeals to Member States to make a more determined effortto meet their financial obligations to the Organization. Weare aware that the assessment system needs reform. Thus we should take the opportunity provided by this session toagree on an equitable scale of assessment for the nexttriennium. The scale of assessment  when finalized  shouldtake into account all relevant circumstances  including thespecial circumstances of archipelagic island developingcountries and the need for the development of avulnerability index. The Bahamas also wishes once again tourge the international community not to use high per capitagross national product (GNP) as the sole measurement ofcapacity to pay when it considers the question of criteriafor the scale. The Bahamas  as well as a number of othercountries  has repeatedly argued that high per capita GNPis not an accurate measurement of a country’s wealth.Indeed  it presents a skewed and distorted picture of theeconomic reality in my own country when one takes intoconsideration the duplication of infrastructure and socialservices.In our efforts to reform this Organization  we mustguard against engaging in reform for reform’s sake. Therestoration of the dignity of the individual must remain ourprimary focus. The extent to which we neglect this highestof priorities is the extent to which human rights abuses andinequities will abound  giving rise to tensions and conflictson various levels  like those that have been witnessed bythe international community in recent years with theescalation of civil wars and ethnic strife in many parts ofthe world. A total breakdown in society is the ultimateconsequence of such activities  which completelyoverwhelm national resources and consume inordinateamounts of international energy which could be far moremeaningfully expended. To achieve meaningful reform wewill have to change our focus significantly. It will requirea shift in paradigms  where issues previously neglected willhave to be brought to the fore.We need to be reminded that economic and socialsecurity directly influence political security. They musttherefore be addressed in an integrated manner. We mustguard against the additional threat of economic mightbeing translated into military power  which not onlysidelines and marginalizes the disadvantaged anddispossessed but also threatens our peace and security.Our efforts must be aimed at raising the standard ofliving and quality of life of the world’s mostunderprivileged. Despite impressive economic growth inmany countries  human development continues to moveat a snail’s pace  particularly in developing countries. Wemust find a way to balance economic growth and humandevelopment so as to ensure the sustainability andlivelihood of future generations.We are merely proposing for the internationalcommunity what is already in place in the Bahamas. Thepromotion and protection of human rights  theadvancement of women  social justice  equality anddevelopment continue to receive priority attention fromthe Government of the Bahamas. We are fully committedto securing a social environment in which our citizens canlive in harmony  prosperity and security  without fear orintimidation. Many of the recommendations contained inthe plans and programmes of action of the recent worldconferences have already been implemented in theBahamas  and we will continue to put in place thenecessary infrastructure to facilitate the implementation ofthose recommendations which have not yet been put intopractice.Our past actions have brought us to a day ofreckoning. The wealth of oceans once deemedinexhaustible has proven finite. Global warming is nolonger a prognostication  but a present condition. What isat stake here is the future of our planet and the lives of itsinhabitants. The Bahamas urges that the special sessionfor the review of Agenda 21 in 1997 be viewed as anopportunity to re-examine our strategy and to correct pastmistakes. The Bahamas hopes that the special session willfocus on practical proposals and not try to renegotiateAgenda 21. Definitive priorities and a recommitment tosustainable development should be set out  taking accountof the recognized peculiar problems of small developingStates and the international community’s commitment toprovide resources to such States.The Bahamas is concerned that protection beprovided to the fragile and vulnerable economies of smallStates in a global community which is moving towards13the strengthening and development of trading blocs. Thenew international trade regime has put small States at adisadvantage with the expectation that they liberalize theirmarkets and open their borders in conformity with theobligations and commitments of the World TradeOrganization. The playing field must be levelled so that dueregard can be given to the fragile domestic economies ofthese States and their macroeconomic position. If thedeveloped countries are demanding protection for theirsensitive domestic industries  then similar demands bydeveloping countries with respect to their domestic industryshould not be viewed as a request that is unreasonable orinconsistent with current international trends.A review of current events reveals new threats to thefragile peace process in the Middle East. The Bahamasurges the parties concerned to make every possible effort torestore order  to refrain from acts of violence and toreactivate the peace process  which enjoyed the widespreadsupport of the international community. We commendPresident Clinton for his initiative in inviting Middle Eastleaders to Washington for discussion aimed at defusing thisvolatile situation and thus  hopefully  restoring confidencein the peace process.Ongoing conflicts in Africa are of grave concern. Theinternational community should see it as its duty to supportmeasures for the prevention and resolution of conflict in thecountries concerned and to address the economic and debtburdens that have crippled Africa. Although the Africancountries themselves have made strenuous efforts towardsreadjustment and recovery  they continue to require theassistance of the international community.The Bahamas welcomes the approval by the Group ofSeven of a debt-relief plan for the world’s poorest nations.The debt-relief measure  which will release as many as 20of the poorest countries from up to $7.7 billion in debt  willgo a long way towards providing the needed relief for thosecountries in their economic growth and development.The Bahamas is pleased to note that after four yearsof devastating warfare free elections have taken place inBosnia and Herzegovina. We note the appointment of aSpecial Representative of the Secretary-General on thequestion of Cyprus  and we urge the parties concerned tocontinue to seek a just and viable solution to that conflict.Violence perpetrated against the people of Cyprus cannot becondoned.Notwithstanding the considerable and praiseworthyefforts of the United Nations and the Organization ofAmerican States  Haiti still remains unstable to a degreethat threatens the stability of the entire region  with acontinuing outflow of immigrants seeking a better way oflife in other countries. The majority of such immigrantsretreat to the Bahamas.It is regrettable that  notwithstanding the assistanceof the international community  many areas of greatconcern remain to be effectively tackled in Haiti.Attempts to restore democracy are constantly hindered bythe absence of the conditions necessary to support them.We are therefore left with a population surrounded bymuch activity  but one whose daily existence remainsmeagre at best. The consequences are predictable  namely unrest and increased violence. It is therefore not sufficientto continue business as usual. The peculiar nature of thesituation in Haiti requires specific  focused and targetedaction that addresses causes and not effects  one in whichinitiatives provide direct benefits to the Haitian people.The Bahamas views with much regret the continuedescalation of the nefarious drug trade  particularly in theLatin American and Caribbean region. We must doubleour efforts to fight this terrible scourge  and it is our hopethat the special session in 1998 will result in a renewedcommitment to fight and eradicate this illicit activity.We are also of the view that efforts must be renewedto address the problem of the traffic in small arms  whichhas increased to alarming proportions in recent times. Weare particularly concerned about the large number ofsmall arms that are smuggled into the Caribbeancountries. We urge the countries that manufacture and sellarms to impose stricter arms control measures andprovide assistance to vulnerable States to reduce thisthreat and increase the latters’ capability to combat suchillegal activity.At the same time  the international community mustvoice unanimous disapproval and condemnation of theunrelenting increase in crime and the rise of terrorism thatis currently confronting the international community. TheBahamas regrets the failure to reach internationalconsensus on dealing swiftly with those grave areas ofconcern. We urge that every effort be made to implementthe relevant agreements already in force and to put inplace any additional measures required to deal with thesereprehensible activities.The proliferation of arms  both conventional andthose designed for mass destruction  poses a serious threatto humanity. Thus  the Bahamas welcomed the recent14adoption of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treatyand intends to add its name shortly to the growing list ofsignatories. Anti-personnel land-mines present an insidiouschallenge to development and human dignity  and weshould move towards a complete ban on such treacheroustools of murder.The Bahamas denounces the continued trans-shipmentof nuclear material and hazardous waste through theecosensitive Caribbean Sea. In this respect  the entireCaribbean Community is in agreement. Indeed in 1992  theHeads of Government of the Caribbean Communitydeclared that the Caribbean Sea should be a nuclear-free-zone for purposes of shipment  storing or dumping of anyradioactive or hazardous substances or toxic waste.The Bahamas is encouraged by the steps taken by thesecond regular session of the International Seabed Authorityat its meeting at Kingston last August  which are gearedtowards ensuring the effective functioning of the Authority.Among the issues before the General Assembly thissession is the matter of the international criminal court. Weexhort the General Assembly to continue its work on thisitem so as to enable the convening of a conference ofplenipotentiaries in 1998 to adopt the statute of the court thus fulfilling a lacuna in the existing international legalorder.As members are aware  the Bahamas is an archipelagicnation which  by any measure  is a small State with apopulation of less than 300 000. However  we are a proudpeople and strong in our belief in justice for all and in theinalienable rights of all people  as enshrined in the Charterof this noble Organization.It is in this spirit of justice and fair play that over thepast two years we have repeatedly recorded our support inthe General Assembly for the efforts of the 21 millioninhabitants of the Republic of China on Taiwan as theyentreat the Organization to examine the merits ofestablishing a committee to analyse in depth theimplications  both now and for the future  of continuing topreclude those 21 million souls from formal representationin the General Assembly by way of membership in theUnited Nations.The Bahamas again calls on the nations of the world as Members of this august and united international body ofnations  to hear the plea of those 21 million souls on theisland of Taiwan and to consider what is just and right forthem as they too seek to avail themselves of the benefitsof membership in the United Nations.The next 50 years will be painful and exacting as weattempt to ensure that the pitfalls of the past are avoided.Many changes will be required. In effecting change  wemust ensure that it is profitable  for while change isinevitable  progress is not. The tendency to hold onto theold way of doing business in the midst of necessarychange will remain our greatest challenge. As we seek tobalance our efforts  it must be remembered thattransformation in one area does not necessarily relegateall others to irrelevance.Many reasons have been proffered for the presentstate of affairs. Not surprisingly  none of them seem toinvolve the proponents. While everyone talks about thefuture  few are willing to make the necessary sacrifices tosecure it. Rhetoric boils with urgency  but talks moveslowly  and action is even more halting.The uncharted waters ahead remain daunting  definedby bilious seas of unrelenting  sophisticated  transnationalcriminal activity  which is tearing at the very fabric ofsociety. Environmental degradation has exposed the Earthto permanent damage. Navigation of these seas requiresus to rise above platitudes and empty promises. We mustrepudiate the adversaries of peace.Our evaluations during the past session confirmedthe continuing validity of the United Nations as theprincipal mechanism for addressing world concerns.Despite its uneven accomplishments  the United Nationsfacilitates collaboration for the resolution of societal ills whatever their origin. The structure and machinery of theUnited Nations must be such that we are encouraged tocontinue to use the relatively calm chambers of this forumfor our deliberations. This is the only safeguard we haveagainst countries’ being tempted to take their disputes outto sea."
"20",785,"BIH",51,1996,"﻿I should first like to greet you Sir  and to wish you a successful term as President of theGeneral Assembly. I am also happy to inform the Assemblythat I come here today from Bosnia  where there is nokilling any more. I make both of these statements withgreat satisfaction.Allow me now to deliver a less optimistic page of myaddress. While flying to New York the day beforeyesterday I read an article published in a prominentAmerican newspaper that dealt with the provision of theBosnian army with arms during the war. The author of thearticle does not say so explicitly  but he implies thateverything that is Muslim smells of terrorism. For him  itseems it is enough to have a Muslim name and to weara beard to be suspicious. The writer also mentions anumber of people. Their only fault is that they helped theBosnian army to obtain some arms during the war. Today there are more than a billion Muslims world wide. I donot know in whose interest it is  in this or similar articles to push them into the embrace of the extremists.Our country and people went through hell. Theworld deemed that it had the right to impose an armsembargo; we believed that we had the right to self-defence. In a competition between those two rights  webelieved  and we still believe  that our right was greater.Therefore  I am not going to apologize to anyone for ourhaving done everything possible to secure arms in orderto survive. On the contrary  I pay tribute to all bravepeople  and express my gratitude to all of the friendlycountries that assisted us during the war. That page of ourhistory is over  and we are turning to a new one: Peace.I thank the United States of America for starting theinitiative for peace and for making efforts  together withother countries  to strengthen this fragile and complexpeace.We are a small country  and we must pursue anopen and honest policy. Secret diplomacy and doublegames are privileges of the mighty. For this and manyother reasons  among which is also the aforementionedarticle  I should like to reiterate some facts and ourobjectives.Bosnia and Herzegovina is possible only as ademocratic State of three equal nations and of free citizens.We accept this fundamental provision of the Dayton PeaceAgreement  with all of its consequences. That is  the well-known formula: one State  two entities  three nations.It is often considered that the Dayton Agreement is notgood enough. It is good because it has stopped the killingin Bosnia and Herzegovina and because a better plan doesnot exist. Its main deficiency is not in it  but in itsimplementation. All of the bad aspects of the Agreementcould be improved if it were completely and consistentlyimplemented. Unfortunately  this is not the case. Accordingto the provisions of the Agreement  “Herceg-Bosna” established as a parallel State during the war  should ceaseto exist. But it still exists and impedes the building up ofthe Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina.The Dayton peace accord provides that the secondentity  the Republika Srpska  should facilitate the return totheir homes of more than half a million Bosniaks andCroats who have been expelled. This is not happening;rather  expulsions are continuing.Generally speaking  the problem of the Dayton PeaceAgreement lies in its selective  that is  partialimplementation. The Serbs  for instance  like paragraph 2of Annex 4  which mentions the Republika Srpska  yet theydo not like Annex 7  which demands the return of peoplewho have been expelled. They accept the first provision andreject the second one. The world  and above all  the ContactGroup members  should tell them explicitly that the Daytonaccord is a whole. If there is no return of the expelledpeople  there is no Republika Srpska. Otherwise  theDayton Agreement will grow from a small and bearableinjustice into a huge and intolerable injustice — and anintolerable injustice leads to new conflict.The provisions of the Dayton Agreement stipulate thatthere should be respect for human rights but  nevertheless human rights are being violated more or less throughout theentire territory.The September elections and the pre-election campaignoffered an opportunity to test this in a very effectivemanner. Conditions are particularly bad in this regard in theterritory of Republika Srpska. For the people from theFederation  neither before nor during the elections was therefreedom of movement  or it was very limited; and onlySerbian political parties could act. Moreover  the electoralboards that registered the voters and counted the ballotsconsisted in all cases of only one nation and  very often one party.With regard to free media  significant progress hasbeen achieved only in the territory of the legal BosnianGovernment  where a large number of independentnewspapers and magazines  40 radio stations  and 12television stations operate. During the last 50 days of thepre-election period  the ruling party had only one-tenth ofthe allotted time available at prime time on the Statetelevision station  Television of Bosnia and Herzegovina from 8 p.m. to 12 p.m.  while opposition parties had nine-tenths of the allotted time at their disposal. TheGovernment also granted preliminary approval to theOpen Broadcasting Network and stands ready to extendthis approval on the condition that the Open BroadcastingNetwork covers the entire territory of Bosnia andHerzegovina and is open to all the political tendencies left and right.The issue of Brcko will be solved by the mainArbitrator  Mr. Roberts Owen  an American  since theSerbian side does not attend the meetings of theArbitration Commission. Both parties have presented theirarguments. I wish to emphasize that  in making hisdecision  the Arbitrator will not be totally free. He isbound by respect for the principles of legality and equity as explicitly stated in Annex 2  Article V of the DaytonAgreement.I will complete this brief analysis of theimplementation of the Dayton Agreement by stating thatthe main war criminals  Karadzic´ and Mladic´  are stillfree  in spite of Dayton  in spite of the orders of theHague Tribunal and in spite of the elementary demandsof justice.We would like to proclaim the principle ofreconciliation of peoples and nations. Bosnia needs this.Here  no one advocates the idea of the collective guilt ofa nation. Guilt is always individual  regardless of thenumber of perpetrators. But for the people to be absolvedand for the road towards reconciliation to be open  thecriminals must be punished. That is why the internationaltribunal in the Hague was established  but  as is wellknown  neither the chief Prosecutor nor the President ofthe Tribunal are satisfied with what the internationalcommunity is doing. In vain  they repeatedly indict theperpetrators and forward the warrants. Even on the issueof war crimes  the world is seeking some painless middle-ground solution. When the issue of war crimes like thosecommitted in Bosnia and Herzegovina comes into2question  every compromise is a shameful betrayal ofjustice. Unpunished war criminals will continue to poisonthe world and ruin its institutions.Some people in Europe  and in the United States also ask whether  after everything that has happened  Bosnia andHerzegovina is possible. These people either do not knowthe facts or are morally corrupt. They do not know that onthe territory of the Serb entity  over half a million people 40 per cent of the indigenous pre-war population of Bosniaand Herzegovina  were either killed or expelled  and theyare totally indifferent to this fact. My answer is that ifgenocide without punishment is possible  then Bosnia andHerzegovina is not possible.So the real question is not whether the people can livetogether  it is more concrete and more straightforward: doesa larger nation have the right to expel a smaller nation andthen  under the slogan “we cannot live together”  usurp itsproperty and demand that these violations be forgotten andlegalized? This is how the question “is Bosnia andHerzegovina possible?” should be formulated. And forpeople of principle and morality  the answer is clear.Finally  what should the future Government of Bosniaand Herzegovina do at this crucial and historic moment forBosnia and Herzegovina? In my opinion  it should beconstituted as a maximally representative Governmentcomposed of all the relevant political actors in conformitywith the results of the elections  including an oppositionfrom both entities. It should thereafter proclaim that itsprogramme consists of at least three points. First  it shouldrequest from all the signatories of the Dayton PeaceAgreement that the Agreement be fully and consistentlyimplemented. At this moment  all the domestic as well asinternational actors  at least verbally  express their supportfor this Agreement. The Government should hold them totheir words. International pressure in this regard will benecessary for a long time.Secondly  the Government should proclaim thereconciliation of the peoples and nations on the conditionthat war criminals are prosecuted vigorously. And thirdly the Government should ensure freedom of the media as away to heal the country. The media started the war severalyears ago with the unprecedented spread of hatred. Themedia can have the same influence in strengthening peacethrough spreading tolerance and understanding among thepeople. State radio and television were an appropriateexample during the election campaign. The OpenBroadcasting Network could also contribute to this if it isopen to all ideas and all political directions and if it isregulated by Parliament.This programme cannot be carried out by theGovernment alone. Bosnia and Herzegovina is still arecovering patient and it needs the world’s support. Thepresence of international military forces will beindispensable for a certain limited period of time  andeconomic assistance will be necessary for longer.Before I conclude  I would like to say a few wordsabout the United Nations. We support reform of theUnited Nations system. The changes are necessary notonly in the Organization but in its psychology as well  ifI may say so. Reform of the Security Council is alsonecessary  in conformity with the changes in the world and also to ensure a new attitude towards obligations. TheUnited Nations must not undertake obligations it cannotcarry out. This is impermissible. My people have paid aninfinitely high price for this irresponsibility.The “safe area” of Srebrenica and its more than8 000 innocent victims are not the only  but are thegravest  example of this incomprehensible attitude. We donot know who is responsible  but we seek reforms whichwill ensure that this will never happen again.Yesterday  in this very building  I signed theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. We are a smallcountry  and my signature on that Treaty is not of greatsignificance. Nevertheless  we want to participate  even ifonly symbolically  in everything that is constructive. Oneday Bosnia and Herzegovina  through its representative will sign a treaty on the suppression of terrorism  andsome other day a treaty on the struggle against drugs andorganized crime. I hope that in future Bosnia andHerzegovina will join in any activity whose aim is toconfront evil  and that it will continually push the limitsin the direction of good and towards a better and saferworld."
"21",832,"BLR",51,1996,"﻿Allow me first of all tocongratulate you  Sir  on your election to the post ofPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-firstsession.General debates over a number of years have alreadyclearly indicated that virtually all Member States considerit of vital importance to transform the United Nations intoan Organization with enhanced potential in the service ofpeace and security in the world.Belarus advocates a pragmatic approach to thereform of the United Nations based on a realisticassessment of the Organization’s ability to enhance thepractical efficiency of the entire United Nations systemalong the strategic lines of its activities. One of these ispeacemaking  which in the aftermath of the cold waracquired new substance and quality.The New Testament reads “Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall becalled children of God.” (Matthew  5:9)Today’s efforts by the United Nations to maintainpeace are noble indeed. Belarus supports actions tofurther perfect peacekeeping operations as an importantpractical instrument at the disposal of the United Nations.18A crystal-clear understanding of peacekeeping operations asa specific means used in conflict settlement  aimed atmaintaining peace rather than imposing it and at preventinghighly explosive situations from emerging  is a sureguarantee that such operations will be successfullyimplemented.We note with satisfaction a substantive breakthroughin the peaceful settlement of the conflict in the formerYugoslavia. Belarus emphasizes the key significance ofrestoring close economic  scientific and cultural tiesbetween the States of the region for the normalization ofthe situation in the Balkans. That is why we support theidea of making the decision of lifting the economic andtrade embargo against the Federal Republic of Yugoslaviaa permanent one.Belarus attaches great significance to the process of apeaceful settlement in the Middle East  based on respect forthe right of all States of the region to live in peace withininternationally recognized borders.As regards the ways and means to further perfect theSecurity Council’s activities  Belarus would like toemphasize the principle of balanced representation for allregional groups of Member States  in particular the EasternEuropean group  in a renewed and expanded SecurityCouncil.Given their particular significance  concertedinternational efforts in the field of disarmament are requiredin shaping the global security system that would befit thetwenty-first century. We consider it a great privilege andhonour that our practical actions and initiatives in thisdomain have been recognized and supported through theelection of a representative of Belarus to the post ofChairman of the First Committee at the current session.This year has been marked by momentous events inBelarus. Very shortly the last nuclear missile will leave theterritory of our Republic  thus making the entire territory ofCentral Europe  from the Baltic to the Black Sea  a nuclear-weapon-free zone. This brings into particular prominencethe initiative put forward by Alyaksandr Lukashenka President of Belarus  to establish a nuclear-weapon-freezone in Central and Eastern Europe.Efforts aimed at setting up and consolidating nuclear-weapon-free zones in various regions of the world aregaining momentum. Hence  we consider it illogical forEurope to remain the only continent where no practicalsteps have been taken in this direction. We strongly believethat setting up a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central andEastern Europe would further enhance the spirit of trust mutual respect and partnership in that part of theEuropean continent and would serve as a solidcontribution by the European nations to nuclear non-proliferation.In the search for an efficient arms control regime the delegation of Belarus intends to initiate furtherconsideration at this session of the General Assembly ofthe item on prohibition of the development andmanufacture of new types of weapons of mass destructionand new systems of such weapons. Ecologically safedestruction of weapons  conversion of military enterprises legal aspects of the transfer of sensitive advancedtechnology and of their impact on the development ofscience and technology stand high on the list of ourpriorities.From this lofty rostrum I am proud to say that despite the formidable economic  social and financialconstraints we have had to overcome  Belarus hascompletely fulfilled all its obligations under the Treaty onConventional Armed Forces in Europe. Equally significantis the fact that Belarus submitted to the Secretary-Generalof the United Nations in July 1996 its ratificationinstruments on joining the Chemical WeaponsConvention.Located in the geographical centre of Europe  mycountry has set itself the goal of preventing dangeroustensions from evolving in the region which  more oftenthan any other part of the planet  has been a seat of worldwars  in order to help prevent the emergence of new linesof separation  curtains  walls and other constructions thatseemed gone for ever.From that perspective  we must bring to theAssembly’s attention the concern of the Belarusian peopleregarding the eventual rapid expansion of North AtlanticTreaty Organization (NATO) and the deployment of itsmilitary infrastructure in close proximity to our borders.It is worth noting that a considerable part of thepopulation of Belarus no longer considers NATO a hostileorganization. Yet  being realistic  we must admit thatmuch more time is needed to transform that attitude intoa sympathetic stance. It would be appropriate to expectthat such large and drastic transformations in theEuropean security system to evolve gradually.In these new circumstances  the role of theOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe19(OSCE) acquires new significance. In all confidence  wepin our hopes on the forthcoming OSCE summit in Lisbon.The results of the summit  I am convinced  will prove to bea solid basis for enhancing coordination between the UnitedNations and the OSCE  as well as for better distributingbetween them the functions of ensuring regional security inEurope in order to help create a comprehensive securitymodel for Europe in the twenty-first century and to furtherthe efforts towards concerted actions by European Statesaimed at strengthening stability on the continent.Globalization of the world economy made it possiblefor the States to considerably expand their markets  as wellas the flow of goods  services  finance and technologies  toadjust economic relations and to improve the economic andsocial well-being of their populations. At the same time  theremoval of trade and other economic barriers exposed thevulnerability of countries with less-developed economies.Many of those countries find it difficult to keep pace withthe rapid transformations now under way and to break thevicious circle of backward development.That is why the countries with economies in transition Belarus included  have every reason to expect that specialmeasures will be taken by the United Nations in order tofacilitate their integration into the world economic and tradesystems and to help them join existing and emergingmultilateral economic institutions and mechanisms.We reiterate our intention to host an internationalconference on the sustainable development of countries witheconomies in transition  to be convened in Minsk in May1997. I am convinced that the results of the conference willprove a valuable contribution to the five-year review of theimplementation of Agenda 21  at the special session of theGeneral Assembly next June.The activities of the United Nations in the social andenvironmental fields have a particular significance forBelarus. The problems in these areas are extremely acutedue to the negative impact of a number of factors thatemerged in the course of complex economictransformations. The leadership of Belarus is undertakingconsiderable efforts to improve the quality of life of itscitizens. At the same time  we are not always able toresolve acute social problems by our own means alone.Decisions adopted at six world summits  held in Rio deJaneiro  Vienna  Copenhagen  Beijing  Cairo and Istanbul have prompted the needed and long-overdue adoption of aglobal programme of assistance to the countries that haveembarked on the road of market reforms.The problem of refugees  displaced persons andrepatriates is also very acute today. Our Republicwelcomes the results of the Geneva regional conferenceon refugees  displaced persons  other forms of forcedmovements and repatriates in the Commonwealth ofIndependent States (CIS). I believe that the establishment under the aegis of the United Nations High Commissionerfor Refugees  of a permanent regional centre on migratoryproblems and refugees for the countries of Eastern Europecould make a considerable contribution to the process ofcomplete and effective implementation of those decisions.We propose that such a centre be headquartered in Minsk.Taking urgent measures to combat terrorism  illicitdrug trafficking and organized crime is yet anotherdemand of the moment. Proceeding from this premise  wewelcome the initiative announced from this rostrum byPoland to introduce a draft United Nations frameworkconvention against organized crime.Our Republic does not possess nuclear energy  butmore than any other State in the world it is interested inthe implementation of effective preventive measures inthe field of nuclear safety that would make it impossiblefor new Chernobyls to occur in the future. Belarus is infavour of the comprehensive strengthening of the nuclear-safety regime  including development and adoption of theappropriate international convention with concrete andstrong commitments under international control. Theinitiative to establish a global fund for environmentalprotection deserves most serious consideration. Mycountry is grateful to the United Nations for its valuableefforts in coordinating  initiating and discussingChernobyl-related issues. This is extremely important tous. At the same time Belarus is deeply concerned over thefact that  alongside the ongoing discussion related to theclosure of the Chernobyl reactor  the problem ofmitigating the medical and environmental after-effects ofthe Chernobyl catastrophe — the main burden of whichhas been borne by our young State — are being pushedaside.We are deeply concerned over the financial situationof the Organization. Admitting that Belarus now findsitself among the States with the biggest debts to theUnited Nations  we cannot but underscore that thissituation has emerged as a result of objective financialand economic difficulties experienced by Belarus at thiscomplex stage of its development  as well as of the unjustdistribution of United Nations expenses among theMember States. Excessive rates of assessment for theUnited Nations regular budget and for peacekeeping20operations has now resulted in one of the founding Statesof the United Nations being unable  for objective reasons to fulfil its financial obligations to the Organization. Inview of this  we support all-round measures aimed atreforming the entire financial system of the United Nationsand the search for fair forms of financial cooperationbetween the Organization and the Member States  inparticular those whose arrears have accumulated due to anumber of reasons beyond their control.Finally  the wide-scale reforming of the UnitedNations system coincides with the democratictransformations taking place in a number of States  Belarusbeing one of them. Given that the reforms now under wayare of immediate concern to each and every citizen of ourcountry  we are fully aware of their significance at thiscrucial juncture in the development of internationalrelations. Comprehension of the importance of that factorenabled Belarus to secure public law and order  stabilityand peace in its territory. Yet sometimes it is not so easyfor the major political actors to achieve a coordinatedapproach to tackling the intricate problems facing Belarusat this transitional juncture in its history. Thus  it hasbecome of vital importance today to find an efficientbalance between the legislative  the executive and thejudicial branches of power and to ensure their stableinteraction. This is precisely the purpose of the upcomingpopular referendum in Belarus  which is being held at theinitiative of President Alyaksandr Lukashenka.The fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations has alsobreathed new life into its ideals and strengthened our beliefthat the United Nations is a unique and genuinely integralpart of international life. I am convinced that the fifty-firstsession of the General Assembly can and must become astarting point for effectively reforming the United Nations which will be possible only through the joint efforts of allMember States of the Organization."
"22",867,"BLZ",51,1996,"﻿In this fifty-first year of theUnited Nations  we are particularly happy to seeMr. Razali Ismail presiding over this Assembly. This isin no small measure due to his well-deserved highreputation. In large measure  too  our joy comes from myGovernment’s appreciation of the deep commitment of hisGovernment to national and international economicimprovement with equity. We are grateful  too  for theexcellent services rendered by his predecessor  Mr. DiogoFreitas do Amaral  in a year in which  under his guidance reform of the United Nations system truly gatheredmomentum.Today it is often remarked that there are many signsof the diminishing role of national sovereignty. In thesphere of human rights  the regional adjudicatory systemscontinue to flourish. Scrutiny is increasingly given by theregional bodies and by such other groupings as theCommonwealth of nations. We have good reason tobelieve that the new commonwealth of Portuguese-speaking nations will soon travel along the same path. At21the United Nations  the General Assembly  the Economicand Social Council (ECOSOC)  the Commission on HumanRights and the human rights treaty bodies all continue toscrutinize States for their rectitude in the field of humanrights. It certainly seems that the High Commissioner forHuman Rights  together with the Office of the UnitedNations High Commissioner for Refugees and otherexecutive agencies  are performing a useful watchdog andcatalytic function.While this Organization’s efforts at humanitarianintervention have not been overwhelmingly successful  theyhave certainly provided evidence of the probable reality thatabsolutist notions of State sovereignty are in decline. Thus we witness the acknowledgement  by States  of sharedinterests which contribute to enhanced cooperation in jointefforts to combat the trafficking of narcotics and topreserve and regenerate the environment. Recently  too  theOrganization of American States launched an initiative thatpoints in the same direction: the inter-American conventionagainst corruption.Corruption has been a scourge throughout our region as it is elsewhere. In our region  therefore  we havedetermined drastically to reduce its impact  even if thatmight have implications for State sovereignty. In the sameway  the flurry of conventions and new organizations on theglobal environment  and the outpourings of the recentglobal conferences and summits on social and other issuesbear witness to the rapid erosion of absolutist notions ofsovereignty.During the past year efforts have been to bring intobeing the long-awaited International Tribunal for the Lawof the Sea. Despite certain regrettable limitations  theAppellate Body of the World Trade Organization  the newtribunal for international trade disputes  has now issued itsfirst judgment. We have also settled down to serious workin preparing for an international criminal court  just as theTribunals for the prosecution of war crimes in the formerYugoslavia and in Rwanda are getting under way. These allconstitute a significant development in the internationalsystem  in which the State and its citizens are increasinglymade subject to international scrutiny.We must insist  however  that what is sauce for thegoose is sauce for the gander. We therefore expect thatlarge States  as well as small States  will fully submitthemselves to these new Tribunals. We also fully expectthat powerful States will refrain from exerting theirsovereign wills over smaller or weaker States.On a different subject  we have also witnessed acertain contraction of the public sector both within nationsand international organizations. The attrition of thenational budgets of capital-exporting and donor countrieshas had a domino effect on international organizationsand capital-importing and recipient countries. So-calledreductions in force and other forms of structuraladjustment have therefore become a painful way of life.In this respect  this Organization and my country andmany others have not been spared. At the same time  mycountry and many others have now established modernand rational systems for the imposition and collection ofindirect taxes and other revenues. I refer especially to thevalue-added tax  the use of which is now virtuallyuniversal.Like most Governments  mine has had to trimseveral vital services. Everywhere  Governments areobliged to experiment with the privatization of manyformer State functions and have liquidated large chunksof State property. Even as these changes occur withinmany economies and Governmental structures  otheractors have stepped onto the national and internationalstage. These actors  of course  include civil society andthe non-governmental organizations  which nowparticipate in almost every aspect of life.At the same time  we are trying to understand andcope with the novel phenomenon of globalization.Globalization has several positive aspects  especiallyliberalization  which it presupposes. However globalization also seems to presuppose theuniversalization of mammoth private-sector enterprisesand associations. This universalization is accompanied byrevision or  in places  the reversal of aspects of such legaland economic doctrines as those that disapproved ofexcessive industrial combinations and monopolies.Nevertheless  globalization is a logicalaccompaniment to the reduction of the scope ofsovereignty. But just as a loss of national autonomy is notan unalloyed blessing  this newfangled gigantism is toomassive to be swallowed whole. For one thing globalization as we are witnessing it today is anunprecedented phenomenon  even for the former empires.Whatever its advocates may say  it sometimes seems tocontradict our very humanity  since the micro-dimensionshould never be neglected in the face of themacro-dimension. Both dimensions are essentiallycomplementary. Globalization  furthermore  sometimesdenies the tenets of  and the recent directions in individual and collective human rights. This is because 22when it is taken to its logical extreme  as it is in severalplaces  it seems to lead to an international euthanasia. Itcontributes to a “dinner-table scraps” mentality  or a “crabs-in-the-basket” attitude  whereby the disadvantaged mightstarve to death or destroy others in order to survive  whilethose who are more advantaged are enabled to gorge evenmore.Furthermore  certain forms of assertive globalizationalso fly in the face of diversity. They are anathema tocultural  social and economic pluralism  whose validity isuncontrovertible in socio-biological terms. As globalizationis increasingly manifested in the electronic andcommunications media  these problems loom very large as throughout the world  we see our youth taking on themind-sets and the habiliments of corrupt  alien trend-setterswho are mainly interested in purveying unnecessaryproducts and creating false desires. As well we know  theconsequences are often mindless violence and sexual andother exploitation of women  children and the weak. Surelythis Organization must seek to ensure that theseconsequences are eradicated.Globalization and the decline of State sovereigntyevidence the dramatic changes sweeping the globe  asubject on which many of us often comment from thisrostrum. Change is indeed the order of the day  and change in these specific respects  is actually part and parcel of thisOrganization and its Charter. After all  despite the fact thatsome would spin theories to the contrary  the veryconception of the United Nations Charter was anenthronement of the doctrine of reduced sovereignty. Onlyby reducing sovereignty could the excesses that wereevident before and during the Second World War becurtailed. Clearly  the very conception of the UnitedNations presupposes a type of essential globalization.It is therefore surprising how  in some quarters globalization by private economic actors pursuing ormotivated by the dictates of acquisitiveness  cupidity orwhat is referred to as “efficiency” can be applauded  whilesimilar but much more modest behaviour by groups ofsovereigns is now decried. We urge that one crucial key tomeaningful reform of the United Nations must surely beenthronement of this Organization’s globalism. We must indeed  enhance efficiency by rationalizing the managerialstructure of the United Nations and the ways in which weselect its executives  as was intelligently suggested in thelatest edition of the important study by Urquhart andChilders  entitled A World In Need of Leadership.We must act globally by harnessing in common theshared resources of the planet. We repeat our call fromprevious general debates that this Organization  in keepingwith its global function  must be given autonomousrevenue authority in certain areas not presently in thedomain of nation States. We must acknowledge the utilityof the concept of a modest  truly representative andrevocable trusteeship over certain ocean and aerial spaces.We may also wish to acknowledge the fact that thenuclear Powers are merely revocable trustees over nuclearweapons  even as we move towards ending all forms ofnuclear testing and comply with the recent AdvisoryOpinion of the International Court of Justice requiring theprompt negotiation  in good faith  of nuclear disarmament.At the same time  we must eradicate everywhere the bitterarsenals of mines and other injurious weapons andnoxious substances  and ensure that substances such asnuclear waste do not pass through our territorial or otherwaters.Responsible globalism will reap for the world thefruits of the promises made in connection with thisOrganization’s wartime antecedents: that economic  socialand all other forms of development are the absoluteheritage of under-possessed and dispossessed individuals peoples and nations. We are under a strict obligation tokeep this Organization’s Agenda for Development on thefront burner. Belize has proposed that we should establishan annual special session of this Assembly immediatelyprior to the general debate  at which we would discussdevelopment policy and regenerate the political willnecessary continually to revise the complex Agenda forDevelopment and the commitments made in thisAssembly  as well as at the high-level global conferencesof this last decade of the twentieth century. At that annualsession  we could also effectively discuss certain specificportions of the Second Committee items currentlydiscussed during the regular session.Enlightened globalism will compel us  with alacrityand dignity  to make good the humanitarian obligations ofthis “one world” to the least-developed countries  toAfrica  to small developing islands and low-lyingdeveloping coastal areas like Belize  to land-lockedcountries and to other disadvantaged places. We should behappy to do so without repeating any of the recent tired uncharitable and inaccurate nostrums about the death ofthe obligation to accord economic preferences to poorcountries  even as we clamour that human rights and23humanitarianism have now been elevated to a place ofhonour in the international pantheon.Even as we extol the virtues of United Nationsglobalism  we can discern another antidote or counterpartto the gigantism of private-sector globalization. This is thephenomenon of regionalism.Regionalism is the concept that drives many currentproposals — including those of Belize — for reform of theUnited Nations Security Council and is a suggested basisfor the selection of additional so-called permanentmembers — privileged  although not serving indefinitely.Incidentally  such a selection could be done entirely withinthe region or  as is done in many cases at present  by theAssembly.Regionalism is the essence of Belize’s proposals forshared seats on the Security Council  whereby adjacent orproximate States can pool their resources to serve theinternational community in that rather expensive enterprise.We gratefully acknowledge the fact that Belize’s proposalshave attracted some attention.Even as portions of Central Africa appear to teeter onthe brink  regionalism has been relatively effective andremains the main hope for preserving peace and security inseveral parts of this troubled world. It acknowledges thereality that the Organization is not structured to carry outpeacemaking and peacekeeping undertakings on a sustainedbasis.My delegation also believes that regionalism canbecome a critical element in the quest successfully toconfront the menace of narcotics without leading tounwitting hegemonism.We now see an abundance of formal arrangements forsubregional integration. These are occurring throughout thefive regions of the United Nations. Informal arrangementsalso abound. These lead us to urge nations in all parts ofthe world  as well as the global body politic  to explorefunctional cooperation on a regional and subregional basis as we now try to do within the Association of CaribbeanStates and as we have done for centuries in severalsub-areas of the Caribbean. We are now witnessing muchfruitful regional liberalization and the integration of labourmarkets  competition policy  labour standards  monetarysystems  investments  technical cooperation and trade.We are happy to witness such functional regionalismin Africa  Asia  Europe and other parts of Latin America.We are also witnessing a reordering of the globe as newregions are identified and new relationships developedbetween regions. Thus  instead of imagining that thePacific islands are worlds apart from the Caribbean andCentral America  as we did when we looked eastward atthem  we now see them as neighbouring fellow citizensof the tropics as we look westward at them over ourfragile isthmus of Central America.From this geopolitical vantage point as well  we seeEast Asia as a partner to the Caribbean and CentralAmerica. This helps us appreciate that the contemporaryapproach to statehood fully justifies the aspirations of ademocratic Asian country that is one of the mostsubstantial players in the global economy for a greatermeasure of political participation in the system ofinternational organizations. That country is Taiwan. In theview of my delegation  such participation would be quiteconsistent with prevailing notions of sovereignty. At thesame time  it is assumed that the territorial integrity of thePeople’s Republic of China would be completelyunimpaired. We believe that the statehood and dignity ofthe latter ancient  honourable and global Power shouldand would be safeguarded in any situation we haveposited. Without meaning to interfere  we would hopethat  in this connection  as has been stated in othercontexts in these remarks  noblesse oblige.Turning to another region  we must reiterate ourconcern about the recent retardation of the peace processbetween Israel and its neighbours. Again  we call forimprovement of conditions in southern Lebanon andelsewhere and for the genuine autonomy that is thebirthright of the Palestinians.Finally  we wish to suggest that regionalism including functional cooperation  will contributesignificantly to the fulfilment of the millennial dreams ofthe architects of this great global Organization."
"23",914,"BOL",51,1996,"﻿Allow me to convey the congratulations of theGovernment and the people of Bolivia  President RazaliIsmail  on your unanimous election  which is a token of theadmiration and esteem in which the peoples of the worldhold Malaysia and constitutes just recognition of yourmerits.My delegation is grateful to the President of theAssembly at its previous session  Ambassador Diogo Freitasdo Amaral  for the remarkable job he did. For thedelegation of Bolivia  it was a distinct honour to serve asVice-President of the Assembly under his able guidance.I wish also to congratulate Secretary-General BoutrosBoutros-Ghali and extend to him our most sincereappreciation for his valuable contributions to internationalpeace and cooperation  as well as for his insightful anduntiring dedication to the cause of the United Nations.Allow me first to refer to some aspects of the far-reaching structural reform in my country.Domestically  since 1993  the Administration ofPresident Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada has beensimultaneously transforming the State and the system ofsocial participation  while also adapting the productivebase of society to enable Bolivia to dynamically meet thedemands inherent to the changes in contemporaryinternational life.The Government of Bolivia’s current efforts areessentially based on the consolidation of participatorydemocratic institutions and on the conviction thateconomic development must be compatible with care fornature and the environment — in other words  that thismust take place within the framework of sustainabledevelopment and of respect for ethnic and culturaldiversity  in order to make unity in diversity possible.My Government’s national plan confers the highestpriority on the struggle against poverty. It strivesvigorously to increase work opportunities and seeks abetter quality of life for all Bolivians  aiming to enter thetwenty-first century with a modern  decentralized participatory State. This perspective guides our policies ofgrass-roots participation  educational reform  andcapitalization of major public enterprises.Part and parcel of this landscape of change are ourinitiatives in support of children  women and the elderly.We are working hard to reduce infant and maternalmortality  to improve levels of nutrition and to provideassistance to those who most urgently need it. These tasksare an essential aspect of our effort to improve the lot ofpoor families.My country is proud of its pluri-cultural andmulti-ethnic character  and it is therefore taking importantinitiatives for the advancement of indigenous peoples. TheVice-President of the Republic  Victor Hugo Cárdenas  isa distinguished representative of Bolivia’s Aymará people.In the international arena  we are actively pursuingpeaceful coexistence among States and trying to makeinternational justice a reality.Our position is based on the principles of equal rightsof States  non-intervention in internal affairs non-recognition of territorial acquisitions by force  respectfor human rights and the other fundamental principles ofinternational law.The support we give to intergovernmentalorganizations  particularly the United Nations and theOrganization of American States (OAS)  reflects ourconfidence in the potential of multilateral cooperation in aworld that is growing ever more complex andinterdependent.At the regional level  we are seeking the economicintegration of Latin America and the Caribbean with theaim of establishing optimal conditions for forging ahemispheric community and establishing a united presenceas the world opens up and markets expand.We are seeking the closest possible ties with countriesthat share our subregional realities  and we are committedto merging the various integration processes. That policyhas prompted Bolivia to sign an agreement forming a free-trade area with the members of the Southern ConeCommon Market (MERCOSUR) — Argentina  Brazil Paraguay  and Uruguay — to sign agreements aimed atupdating and reinvigorating the Andean Common Market made up of Bolivia  Colombia  Ecuador  Peru andVenezuela  and to give effect to numerous bilateral treatiesto enhance mutual complementarity on the basis of ourexperiences and the need to foster material and spiritualexchanges between nations.The physical integration of the countries of the regionconstitutes another central issue deserving priority attention.We are working actively on the definition of inter-oceaniccorridors  and we attach great importance to the future ofthe Plata Basin and the Treaty for Amazonian Cooperation.With regard to Bolivia’s maritime question  I mustinform the international community  as we have done everyyear  that Bolivia has reiterated in various forums itspolitical willingness to begin negotiations that take properaccount of the interests of all the parties involved andensure Bolivia’s sovereign presence with regard to thePacific Ocean.No clear willingness to engage in dialogue can yetbe seen. However  on the basis of contacts on this matterwe can say that  despite historical difficulties andultranationalist suspicions  minds are opening andobjective foundations are being laid with a view toencouraging a timely solution to old problems through theexchange of ideas  the nurturing of mutual trust  mutualinterest and hemispheric understanding  in the hope that before long  brotherhood  equality  justice and therequirements of international peace and cooperation willtruly prevail.This year Bolivia had the honour to act as protempore secretariat of the Rio Group  a high-level forumof consultation and political coordination for an importantgroup of Latin American and Caribbean States. In thatcapacity  Bolivia was the venue of the sixth regularmeeting of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Rio Groupand the European Union  held last April in the city ofCochabamba. On that occasion we reaffirmed ourreadiness for joint endeavours between Latin America  theCaribbean and Western Europe. The meeting strengthenedties between the two regions  based on respect for humanrights  the fundamental rights of citizens and theprinciples of democracy and political pluralism.The Ministers highlighted  inter alia  the danger ofdrugs and related problems  recognizing the importance ofmaintaining political dialogue on this issue at the highestlevel and agreeing on the need to strengthen the UnitedNations International Drug Control Programme (UNDCP).The meeting called upon the international community todeal with the phenomenon of drugs through joint actionbased on the principle of global  shared responsibility. Tothat end  consideration and support were given to theproposal to hold a special session of the GeneralAssembly in 1998 to address this crucial issue.Worldwide awareness of the need for joint action isreaching its peak  and Bolivia hopes that the proposedmeeting will lay down positive guidelines to put an endto the scourge of drugs.I am also pleased to inform representatives that on3 and 4 September 1996  again in the Bolivian city ofCochabamba  the Meeting of Heads of State of the RioGroup took place  on the occasion of the tenthanniversary of the creation of that standing body. It was2a great honour for my country to welcome such illustriousguests.The Presidents and Prime Minister gathered therenoted with satisfaction that our region had made significantheadway in fighting international crime. As evidence ofthis  they pointed to the signing in Caracas of the Inter-American Convention against Corruption  the results of theSpecialized Inter-American Conference on Terrorism  heldin Lima  and advances in the development of a hemisphericstrategy against drugs and related crimes in the frameworkof the Inter-American Commission against Drug Abuse.The Heads of State and Government expressed theirsatisfaction at the fact that our region had become the firstnuclear-weapon-free zone through the adoption of theTreaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in LatinAmerica and the Caribbean.The Final Declaration of the tenth summit expressedthe joint position of the Governments of the region on theissues of representative democracy and the eradication ofpoverty. It placed on record their deep conviction withregard to sustainable development; it set forth preciseguidelines on regional integration and trade; it expressed afirm resolve to press ahead in the fight against drugs andrelated crimes; it emphasized  in particular  the importanceof the Inter-American Convention against Corruption; andit reiterated emphatically the crucial importanceGovernments  from their position of lofty responsibility attached to cultural integration.My delegation has requested that the Secretariat of theUnited Nations circulate the final document of theCochabamba meeting to all delegations in the GeneralAssembly.With regard to the matter of the extraterritoriality ofnational laws  a most sensitive issue for peoples andGovernments the world over  the Rio Group summitmeeting expressed its rejection of any attempt to use acountry’s domestic legislation to impose unilateral sanctionsof an extraterritorial character  as this contravenes thestandards governing coexistence between States  disregardsthe fundamental principle of respect for sovereignty and isa clear violation of international law.Bolivia is confident that intelligence and fairness willprevail on this delicate matter and that a solution will soonbe found  in the interest of international coexistence andeconomic and commercial freedom for all peoples of theworld.One of the most outstanding internationaldevelopments of our time was undoubtedly the UnitedNations Conference on Environment and Development  inRio de Janeiro in 1992.With the aim of laying the groundwork for ahemispheric agenda for sustainable development  severalinternational meetings  starting with the Summit held inMiami in 1994  have expressed support for the decisionto hold a hemispheric meeting at the level of Heads ofState and Government in the Bolivian city of Santa Cruzde la Sierra  scheduled for 7 and 8 December of this year.That meeting will be a new opportunity to set the courseof national and international endeavours for sustainabledevelopment in the light of economic  social andenvironmental goals and in reaffirmation of theimportance of obtaining new and additional resources tofinance the plan of action to be adopted.Bolivia has offered to work its hardest alongside itssister nations to ensure the success of this majorhemispheric event and is certain that inter-Americansolidarity will lead to positive results.The agenda of the fifty-first session of the GeneralAssembly contains more than 160 items of particularinterest to the international community. My Governmentis prepared to participate constructively in theconsideration and resolution of each of them.We are concerned with problems of internationalpeace and security and trust that the United Nationssystem will contribute effectively to finding solutions forthe many parts of the world beset by conflicts and war.As I stated on a previous occasion  Bolivia is of theview that many conflict situations can be explained by thepersistence of unresolved social and national problems  aswell as by the accumulation of age-old injustices andresentments; by geopolitical and economic interests thatfor decades have been fuelling confrontation from withoutand from within; and  above all  by Governments’inability to cooperate effectively so as to provide timelyand peaceful solutions to the problems of greatest nationalconcern.We have participated in the debates on reforms ofthe United Nations Charter  and we believe that it is ofthe utmost importance to reach consensus in order tostrengthen the multilateral system in the interests of theworld community. We support the positions set forth bythe Non-Aligned Movement in this regard.3Difficult international circumstances are making itincreasingly clear that the United Nations needs to bestrengthened  to adapt its structures and strengthen theOrganization as a legitimate forum for the study coordination  follow-up and implementation of universallyaccepted policies. Accordingly  Bolivia considers it essentialto strengthen the General Assembly  the Security Counciland the role of the International Court of Justice. Withregard to the expansion of the Security Council  weconsider it necessary that Germany and Japan be present asnew permanent members and that three other permanentmembers from Asia  Africa  and Latin America and theCaribbean be selected. The expansion should becomplemented by an appropriate number of non-permanentmembers from the developing world. Of course  ifconsensus could be reached on other formulas  then otherproposals  such as the one presented by Italy  would needto be considered.With regard to the veto  Bolivia shares the view that ideally  the international community should move towardseliminating this device — and  one would hope  in the not-too-distant future. In the meantime  use of this deviceshould be strictly limited to actions relating to cases ofthreats to the peace  breach of the peace or acts ofaggression referred to in Chapter VII of the United NationsCharter.Bolivia is greatly concerned about the political andsocial situation in many African countries. We express oursolidarity with these countries  as we did to fraternal SouthAfrica during its times of trial  and we urge theinternational community  especially the rich countries of theworld  to cooperate generously and resolutely in order tocope with the grave economic problems of this continent.We also express our solidarity with our brothers in theMiddle East. We believe that the time has come to heal oldwounds and frame the terms of a just and lasting peace taking into account the need for secure borders for all anddefinitively resolving the situation through the creation ofa Palestinian state. A solution must also be found to thequestions of Jerusalem and the Golan Heights  and theterritorial integrity and full sovereignty of all States of theregion must be preserved.We rejoice in the fact that Bosnia and Herzegovinahas embarked upon a new road to understanding  unity andconstruction of new democratic institutions.The brotherly nations of Asia offer us remarkableexamples of the possibilities and opportunities foraccelerated economic development. Their successes fill uswith confidence  and we are certain that they will applythe same wisdom to finding solutions to the social andpolitical problems that some of them still face.We are convinced that the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty  adopted by the General Assembly on 10September of this year  represents a landmark along theroad to the total elimination of nuclear weapons. Boliviahas signed the papers of accession to the new Treaty andhopes to complete the constitutional procedures for itsapproval and ratification in a relatively short time.We stress just as emphatically the need to ban theuse and production of anti-personnel mines  which havebeen leaving a trail of blood among the peoples of theworld.The economic and social items before the Assemblyalso deserve our keenest interest  since they are amongthe essential tasks of the United Nations and ofinternational cooperation. From our view of theinternational scene  questions pertaining to respect forhuman rights and democratic development in all countriesare also matters of very high priority.As representatives are aware  Bolivia has putforward its candidacy for a non-permanent seat on theSecurity Council for the period 1997-1998  the electionsfor which will be held during the present session of theGeneral Assembly.As a founding member of the United Nations Bolivia carries the principles of the Charter deep withinits national spirit and has maintained a policy ofrecognition of and support for this universal Organization.In recent years my country has contributed to the forcesof United Nations Operation in Mozambique (ONUMOZ) as well as to the election-monitoring processes inEl Salvador and Mozambique. We are also prepared toparticipate in United Nations standby arrangements. Withregard to Haiti  Bolivia had the privilege of presiding overthe ad hoc group of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs ofthe Organization of American States and contributedpolice personnel during the first stage of the democraticnormalization of that sister nation. Bolivia intends tocontinue participating in United Nations activities tofoster international peace and cooperation.In this regard  I am pleased to note that my countryenjoys excellent  long-standing diplomatic relations withthe five permanent members of the Security Council and4that it plays an active part in the Non-Aligned Movement whose thirty-fifth anniversary we have just celebrated in anexpression of steadfastness in our convictions and incontinued political cooperation.We share common problems with developingcountries  land-locked States and small States the worldover. Our established friendship with all the countries ofAmerica  Africa  Asia  Europe and Oceania has enabled usto learn from their important experiences and better tounderstand their many problems.If our brother nationsrepresented here see fit to honour us with their trust Bolivia undertakes to place its particular dedication at theservice of the international community in the SecurityCouncil.As we move towards the end of the twentieth centuryand make preparations to welcome a new century and anew millennium  peoples and nations cannot ignore deep-rooted trends towards new and untrodden systems of humancoexistence.In that connection  we must ensure that small Statesparticipate actively in the international arena in promotingmankind’s dream of making one out of many. That canoccur only if the rules of the game are clearly defined andimplemented and if effective worldwide instruments arecreated. It is here  in the existence of and respect forinternational law and justice and the institutions thatembody them  that peoples  nations and States can find theonly possible lodestar to guide them. Otherwise  they willbe condemned to new and ominous forms of modernslavery. That is why Bolivia believes  today more than ever in the validity of the United Nations and will work to theutmost to defending and strengthening it."
"24",961,"BRA",51,1996,"﻿Please accept mycongratulations  Sir  on your election as President of theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-first session. The Braziliandelegation is confident that  under your leadership  thisbody will find new strength in the pursuit of theprinciples and purposes of our Charter.I also wish to pay tribute to my dear friend  Mr.Diogo Freitas do Amaral  for the dedication with whichhe conducted the historic fiftieth session. We are gratefulfor his steadfast commitment to ensuring that our workwas consistent with the high expectations of the fiftiethanniversary celebrations.My delegation extends a word of gratitude andrecognition to the Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros-Ghali for the perseverance he has shown in carrying out histasks.For the first time  Angola  Brazil  Cape Verde Guinea-Bissau  Mozambique  Portugal and Sao Tome andPrincipe come to the General Assembly as members ofthe Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries  a bodydedicated to cooperation and political coordination. Themember States of the Community intend to consult and towork closely together at the United Nations with a viewto better promoting their common interests and fosteringtheir linguistic  cultural and historical identity.The countries of the Southern Cone Common Market(MERCOSUR) — Argentina  Brazil  Paraguay andUruguay — have also come to the General Assemblywith an enhanced sense of unity. MERCOSUR gives livingand concrete expression to economic integration and openregionalism and represents one of the creative forces atwork in the Americas. It is a new and striking feature ofour continent’s identity and a reflection of democracy andthe commitment to economic reform in our region.With the customs union firmly in place  Chile has nowjoined MERCOSUR as an associated State by means of afree-trade agreement with far-reaching political anddiplomatic implications. Bolivia will also shortly associateitself with MERCOSUR. We look forward to othercountries’ of the region joining as well to further bolster thedynamic and open nature of MERCOSUR.Now firmly rooted in the process of expanding andacting as an important partner of a growing number ofcountries and regional groups  MERCOSUR is a positiveresponse by South American countries to the challenges andopportunities of today’s world. Such achievements asMERCOSUR and the Community of Portuguese-speakingCountries enhance their credentials and help to make thepresence of those countries in the world an instrument foreconomic development and social progress.My country comes to this General Assembly proud topresent itself before the international community with astronger presence in the world. Brazil owes this to theconsolidation of its democracy  to economic stabilizationand liberalization and to the resumption of economicgrowth with a deeper sense of social justice. It owes this aswell to its participation in regional integration and in theglobalization of the world economy. We are in tune withthe two main forces that are shaping the world today:political and economic freedom  on the one hand  andcooperation through integration and trade on the other.I am pleased to say that  through decisive action ratherthan words  we have made genuine strides in enlarging ourdialogue and cooperation with friendly nations worldwide developed and developing alike. We have strengthenedtraditional partnerships and established new ones  especiallyin Africa  Asia and the Middle East. We are aware that  ifthe Brazilian people are to consolidate these achievements we will need to persevere in the policies that have broughtus this far. We know that these policies have yet to meetmany challenges Brazil faces in the social  economic andcultural fields. But they are an important beginning.We are convinced that Brazil’s growing interactionwith its region and the world  the consolidation of itsinternational partnerships and a fruitful dialogue andcooperation with its many friends are necessary conditionsfor our country to continue to pursue its policies at thedomestic level.Brazil is one of the world’s largest democracies  adynamic and diversified developing economy  anattractive opportunity for productive foreign investmentand a market of huge potential — in a word  a countrycapable of enjoying fruitful ties with all nations on thebasis of mutual respect and reciprocity. By its verynature  Brazil can act as a bridge between the manydifferent worlds that make up its own internal reality.Our aspirations to enlarging the scope of ourparticipation in the international decision-making bodieswill always reflect a careful assessment of our ownmerits  of our specific weight and of the contribution thatwe can make to the community of Nations. We seek to bea force for peace and integration.The fiftieth anniversary of the United Nationsunderstandably raised the expectations of the internationalcommunity — expectations that we would not dwell onlyon the past and on the many achievements of theOrganization  but also look to the future in search ofways for it to come to grips with new realities andproblems.We can confidently say that the celebration of thefiftieth anniversary produced good results. As worldpublic opinion was focused on the United Nations  leadersand Governments were compelled to reflect on theOrganization and to make room for it in their politicalagendas.The historic meaning of the San Francisco Charterwas recalled  as was the importance of the United Nationsas a forum for political debate and as a sounding boardfor conflicting interests in the post-cold-war era.Our collective reflection clearly revealed that without the United Nations  the world would only havebeen more violent  more unstable and insecure  moreunjust and cruel — especially to the weak  who are preyto power politics and arbitrary decisions.We celebrated great advances in international lawand in the political and ethical commitments to the issuesthat concern humanity — issues such as sustainabledevelopment  protection of the environment  respect forhuman rights  disarmament  non-proliferation and the fightagainst poverty  terrorism  organized crime and drug2trafficking. We have thus given a positive account in thefirst 50 years of the United Nations.We cannot say with the same confidence that thefiftieth anniversary has ushered in a renewed commitmentto the United Nations and its future. Our efforts have fallenwell short of the expectations of the internationalcommunity. They have been disappointing even in the lightof the predictions of some of the most cautious analysts. Astalemate persists — an uncomfortable stalemate that leadsto a feeling of uncertainty and frustration  of insecurityabout the future of the United Nations  and thus ofapprehension.In the wake of momentous changes on theinternational scene  the United Nations has embarked upona new phase in its history without the means and theeffectiveness to act as the highest political forum ofmankind and to fulfil the mandate conferred upon it by theinternational community — a mandate that remains as validtoday as it was half a century ago.Back in 1961  President John F. Kennedy referred tothe United Nations as “our last  best hope”. In the face ofthe threat of nuclear war and in the midst of variousconflicts  those words expressed the confidence of theinternational community in an Organization founded on theuniversal principles of peace  understanding and prosperityfor all peoples.At that time President Kennedy renewed a pledge tothe United Nations  offering:“our pledge of support — to prevent it from becomingmerely a forum for invective  to strengthen its shieldof the new and the weak and to enlarge the area inwhich its writ may run.”Thirty-five years after these inspired words  the UnitedNations finds itself at a crossroads. The world has changed the correlation of forces has changed  and so have thehopes and expectations of countries with regard to theUnited Nations and its capacity to manage  prevent andsettle conflicts. Yet various confrontations still causesuffering  instability and misery throughout the world.This is happening just as the Organization faces theworst financial and motivational crisis in its history. Thereis a widespread feeling of dissatisfaction — sometimesveiled and sometimes explicit — with an Organization thatstill embodies the loftiest ideals ever conceived by thehuman spirit in the search for peace and understandingamong peoples.Brazil is committed to the United Nations Charterand to the Organization’s political  legal and diplomaticlegacy of the past 50 years. That commitment is part ofthe diplomatic history of my country and of the principlesthat have always governed our actions in this body and inour relations with all peoples  particularly with our 10neighbours  with whom we have lived in peace for wellover a century.Compelled by that commitment  we sound a word ofcaution to those who  like ourselves  wish to see theUnited Nations as a source of leadership in internationalrelations  as an instrument for promoting an internationalsociety based on freedom  the rule of law and the rightsof the citizen.With the political and ideological constraints of thecold war behind us  the world is now organized aroundmuch more concrete and pragmatic variables  such asinternational trade  investment flows and the transfer oftechnology. The emphasis on political and ideologicalcoalitions has given way to an emphasis on economiccoalitions. Pressured by public opinion  Governments aretoday concerned with social well-being  the quality of life economic and social indicators and unemployment.The focal point of the political debate is shiftingirrevocably from strategy and ideology to economics andintegration. That is why the world is following the pathof large-scale regional economic agreements. North-Southand East-West — the main axes of international politicsin the last 50 years — have given way to groups ofcountries dedicated to the goals of economic integrationand the coordination of macroeconomic  financial andtrade policies.North  South  East and West are no longer thecardinal points on the international political compass. TheWorld Trade Organization and its body of universal rulesand regulations for fostering free trade  the EuropeanUnion  the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Council(APEC)  the North American Free Trade Agreement(NAFTA)  the Organisation for Economic Cooperationand Development (OECD)  the Group of 7  theAssociation of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)  theSouth African Development Community (SADC)  and theSouthern Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR) havebecome  in their respective areas of action  the catalysts3for development  cooperation  understanding and  indeed for peace.The peace that the founders of the United Nationsenvisioned may come about as a result of the response bythe various regions and groups of countries to thechallenges  opportunities and risks of a new world  whichtoday is called the world of globalization. It is a world thatgenerates prosperity and a healthy competition amongcountries and regions; but it is also a world that swells theranks of the destitute and the outcast among and withincountries  a world that breeds conflict and increasesinequality  a world that demands reason  reflection andconstructive action.Through peace  cooperation  respect for human rightsand development  the United Nations has a major role toplay in preventing the divisions of the cold war fromfinding new expression in a widening gap in well-being.The Organization must evolve in order to successfullyplay that role as it has so often done in the past. It mustadapt its structure and methods of work in order tooptimize its human  material and financial resources. Itmust make use of the great political  strategic  and moralpower it is able to muster. It must implement and follow upon its decisions  on the rules with which it updates andconsolidates international law and on the commitments ithas won from the international community.Much remains to be done in the wake of the greatconferences that have shaped the international agenda in thepresent decade. The conferences on the rights of the child the environment and development  human rights  populationand development  social development  women and humansettlements have sealed commitments that must behonoured  decisions that must be implemented and follow-up work that must be carried out.The United Nations must ensure that its agendabecomes more appealing and results-oriented  in order toearn the esteem of the public and to retain its primacy ininternational relations. We must correct the tendency toconvene meetings whose only purpose is to produce othermeetings or to adopt resolutions of a rhetorical nature. Wemust rid the United Nations of its image as a lethargic bodyincapable of rising to the challenges of our times.Brazil is convinced that United Nations reformremains within reach  that it is still possible to ensure thatthe United Nations will play a paramount role in this newphase of its existence. We believe in reform as a means toensure that the United Nations becomes a viable andlogical alternative to unilateralism and power politics. Webelieve in reform as a means to empower the UnitedNations to act in a radically changed world. We believein reform as a means to restore the United Nations as aunique forum for political and diplomatic action anddebate.One year after our Heads of State and Governmentdrew attention to the seriousness of the financial situationof the United Nations  a solution to the problem remainselusive.To stifle the United Nations little by little bydepriving it of the means to perform its functions is noway to secure greater administrative efficiency. Shouldthis scenario persist  then the capacity of the UnitedNations to adapt to the dynamics of the contemporaryworld could be seriously jeopardized. We could very wellwitness a situation where other bodies come to occupy thespace left by the United Nations  bodies with their owngoals and agendas  which may or may not reflect theprevailing sentiments of the international community andthe interests of world peace  security and stability. That iswhy we need perseverance  courage and  above all  thepolitical will to advance the discussion on issues whichreflect a true commitment to the United Nations  issueswhich relate to the very relevance of the Organization ininternational relations on the eve in the twenty-firstcentury.One of these issues is the reform of the SecurityCouncil. There is a virtual consensus that the SecurityCouncil should be enlarged to allow for greaterparticipation by countries with the capacity to act on aglobal scale and the willingness to bear theresponsibilities that would entail. We must now set acourse for this process. Its outcome is essential forstrengthening the United Nations.Brazil has made several commitments in the field ofnuclear disarmament and non-proliferation of weapons ofmass destruction and their delivery systems. We are nowcommitted to having the southern hemisphere recognizedas an area free of nuclear weapons. It is our firm beliefthat this is a right to which the peoples of the southernhemisphere are entitled  and an obligation on the part ofthose throughout the world who possess nuclear weaponsor the means to develop them.A further commitment to disarmament in all fieldsthat I now wish to convey to the General Assembly is the4decision by the Brazilian Government to declare amoratorium on the export of anti-personnel land-mines. Theexperience of the Brazilian contingent serving in the UnitedNations Angola Verification Mission has underlined for usthe importance of a universal moratorium of this kind andthe need to rid the world of the scourge of land mines which pose a threat to the daily lives of millions of humanbeings. We would like to see all countries that export land-mines or that have the capability to do so join in thisdecision.The international community has placed its hopes ina Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). Thesehopes are fully justified. We have a historic opportunity toput an end to an outdated practice which has increasinglydrawn repudiation and condemnation from internationalpublic opinion. We are taking an important step towardsgeneral and complete nuclear disarmament and statingunequivocally that there is no room in today’s world fornuclear weapons or regional arms races.Brazil is committed to the non-proliferation ofweapons of mass destruction and to the elimination ofnuclear arsenals. It has consistently expressed itsdisapproval of nuclear tests. Brazil strove for approval ofthe CTBT at the Conference on Disarmament andconsidered the blocking of consensus in Geneva a gravesetback. It was inconceivable to Brazil that we could havelet the moment pass  that we could have run the risk ofseeing the CTBT meet the same fate as so many otherinitiatives which were allowed to lapse into oblivion.This is why Brazil was one of the first sponsors of theAustralian initiative to seize the historic opportunity ofsubmitting the CTBT for approval by the GeneralAssembly. This decision reflected the commitment tobequeath to present and future generations a safer andnuclear-weapons-free world. This is why Brazil willimmediately sign the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-BanTreaty. We call upon all nuclear- and non-nuclear-weaponStates to do the same.The peoples of the world expect action and leadershipfrom the United Nations. They expect that the UnitedNations will continue to be an essential benchmark ofinternational politics over the next 50 years and that it willalways be not the last  but our best hope."
"25",1005,"BRB",51,1996,"It is my pleasure tocongratulate Ambassador Razali on his election asPresident of the fifty-first session of the GeneralAssembly. The Barbados delegation shares fully theconfidence expressed in his leadership and assures him ofits cooperation in the work of this Assembly.Let me also warmly commend his predecessor  HisExcellency Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral  for hisoutstanding stewardship of the fiftieth session  includingthe Special Commemorative Meeting on the occasion ofthe fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations. Thatcelebration  which brought together 128 Heads of State orGovernment  stands as a fitting memorial to the historicevent.My country’s knowledge of and appreciation for theUnited Nations system has deepened since we had thehonour to host the United Nations Global Conference onthe Sustainable Development of Small Island DevelopingStates in 1994. The Barbados Declaration and Programme14General Assembly 20th plenary meetingFifty-first session 3 October 1996of Action outlined the way forward for the relationshipbetween small island developing States and the internationalcommunity. The Barbados Conference was the first and todate the only follow-up Global Conference to the UnitedNations Conference on Environment and Development because it was recognized that small island developingStates have a critical role to play in sustainabledevelopment.Barbados and other members of the Alliance of SmallIsland States will unremittingly pursue the follow-up to theProgramme of Action because our survival depends on it.We have  however  been disappointed to note that so muchof the promise of the Programme of Action for theSustainable Development of Small Island Developing Stateshas as yet gone unfulfilled  and we will engage theinternational community further to ensure that our concernsare addressed.Barbados welcomes the coming into force of theUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and theestablishment of the International Seabed Authority and theInternational Tribunal for the Law of the Sea. This newregime for the world’s oceans is of particular interest to usand to small island developing States in general  because ofthe critical link between the maritime environment and ourland mass. Small island developing States are in some waysjust coastal zones  and as such have a particularly intimaterelationship with the oceans  upon which we depend forfood and which are pivotal to our tourism industry.It is in this context that we view with apprehension theuse of the Caribbean Sea for the trans-shipment of nuclearand other hazardous materials. While we understand theneeds of countries to dispose of and reprocess wastematerials  and we recognize their right to do so under Lawof the Sea  International Maritime Organization andInternational Atomic Energy Agency regulations  we fearthe consequences of accidents for an environment which isso highly fragile. The Caribbean presents a uniquecombination of factors which demand that it be treated withspecial care: large numbers of small island developingStates  a semi-enclosed sea subject to violent seasonalstorms  and the presence of one of the most intensivelyused shipping passages  the Panama Canal. The Heads ofGovernment of the Caribbean Community have repeatedlydeclared their opposition to the use of the Caribbean Seafor trans-shipment of nuclear materials. We look forward todeepened dialogue with flag States and other concernedStates and organizations to ensure that we are all aware ofwhat is being shipped  when and where  and how best tomanage it.The vulnerability of Caribbean micro-States isfurther increased by narco-trafficking. This illicit tradethreatens the very existence of our democracies  a pointthat was reinforced earlier this year when the UnitedNations International Drug Control Programme held aconference in Barbados on drug enforcement andrehabilitation cooperation in the Caribbean.Regional cooperation is the responsible and effectivemeans for implementing international agreements dealingwith this matter. The response of the internationalcommunity to our peculiar set of problems has beenencouraging  but it must continue to be upgraded. Wesuffer not so much because we are major end-users  butbecause of our strategic location in this traffic. We willcontinue in our efforts  with the limited resources wehave at our disposal  to ensure that the drug traffic doesnot undermine the foundations of our democracies. Wewill not stand accused of not cooperating with ourpartners  but neither will we allow our hard-foughtsovereignty to be sacrificed in the tug-of-war between themoral and societal imperative to curtail demand and theneed to reduce supply.As we herald the International Decade for theEradication of Poverty  this delegation is appalled that in1996  despite the advances in technology and the newwealth being generated by the forces of globalization millions of children still do not have access to the mostbasic necessities.Just as we argued at the Second United NationsConference on Human Settlements (Habitat II) thathumankind has a right to housing  Barbados fully supportsthe notion that individuals have a right to adequatenourishment. We look forward to the World Food Summitlater this year in Rome as being the catalyst for majorchange towards alleviating hunger.Women are among the most impoverished groups inour societies  and gender equality is a major vehicle forachieving sustainable human development. AlthoughBarbados ranks high on the human development index particularly as it relates to gender equality  the BeijingPlatform for Action remains for us a critical policy andaction framework.The landmark fiftieth session was an occasion forsolemn reflection on the mission and performance of theUnited Nations and for a constructive assessment of thechallenges which confront the Organization in the post-cold-war world. Member States have left no doubt about15General Assembly 20th plenary meetingFifty-first session 3 October 1996the critical role that the United Nations must continue toplay in fostering global peace and security and promotingsustainable development. They have recognized that notwithstanding its shortcomings  this Organization remainsthe only universal mechanism which offers the hope ofachieving the goals for humanity enshrined in its Charter.The task with which we have been charged is to revitalizethe United Nations and to strengthen its capacity to meetthe new demands of rapid global change. My delegationtherefore attaches the greatest importance to the WorkingGroups established by the General Assembly to advance thereform process  in order to make the world a more peacefulplace and to improve the Organization’s effectiveness inpromoting economic and social development.Reform is now the order of the day. No country orinstitution can neglect the reality of globalization or thetechnological revolution that drives this process. It posesmajor challenges for countries and societies  particularlysmall developing countries. We recognize only too well ourown vulnerability to marginalization  stemming fromintense global competition and reform of major globalinstitutions  including the United Nations. Barbadostherefore follows with special interest the consultationstaking place in the Open-ended Working Group on theQuestion of Equitable Representation on and Increase in theMembership of the Security Council and other MattersRelated to the Security Council. The question of equitablerepresentation of small States is of particular concern  andwe are studying closely those proposals which take thisconcept into account. At the same time  we note withsatisfaction the broad convergence of views on enlargementof the Council  and the importance being given to measuresto improve its working methods and procedures  to enhanceits democratic and representative character  and to fostergreater transparency.We also recognize the important consultations whichare proceeding in the other Working Groups. When thistask is successfully completed  we envisage a UnitedNations restructured and re-energized  to accelerateeconomic and social development in a world where absolutepoverty still afflicts over one billion people who exist onless than one dollar a day.Commitment to reform notwithstanding  the capacityof the Organization to support this global agenda is beinghampered by recurring financial crises. The United Nationsnow finds itself at the crossroads. In April 1996  theSecretary-General cautioned that the United Nations was onthe brink of financial disaster. Regrettably  this outlook hasnot markedly improved to date. Given this prospect  it isclear that resolute action to address this crisis can nolonger be postponed if the integrity of the Organizationand the viability of its mandates are to be preserved. Inour view  we have debated far too long obligations whichare so clearly spelt out in the United Nations Charter.Barbados holds firmly to the position advanced bythe Group of 77 and China that the crisis derivesessentially from the Organization’s cash flow problem created by the failure of major Member States to pay theircontributions in full and on time. More generally  wesupport the principle of periodic review of the scale ofassessments  designed to ensure the long-term financialviability of the United Nations  based on the principle ofcapacity to pay; but we do not believe that this should belinked conditionally to the issue of arrears as we searchfor a solution to the present crisis.This Assembly will once again review the manyunresolved problems which dominate the global politicalscene. The world still awaits the dawn of the new era ofpeace envisaged at the end of the cold war. As a smalldeveloping country  Barbados is ever conscious of thepeaceful domestic climate it has enjoyed sinceindependence in 1966  which has fostered its economicand social development. We therefore share the anguishof the international community for those countries whereinternal strife and regional conflict  and their attendanthuman suffering  continue to deny economic and socialprogress to millions of their people.My delegation therefore welcomes the peace processwhich is being implemented in Bosnia and Herzegovinaunder the Dayton accords. Though still fragile  thisAgreement  we think  offers the best prospects for peaceso far  and we hope for an end to a conflict which hasthreatened the very credibility of the United Nations. Wehope that the recent elections will be a further major stepin the building of the confidence and trust so crucial tolong-term reconciliation.Recent outbreaks of violence in the Middle Easthave renewed our anxieties about peace in that region.The international community yearns for the day when afull and lasting peace is consolidated in this entire region bringing to an end the long cycle of violence. We urge allthe parties to re-embark on this journey and redouble theirefforts to recapture the momentum of the peace process which has so far brokered agreements between Israel andEgypt  Jordan and Palestine.16General Assembly 20th plenary meetingFifty-first session 3 October 1996In Africa  a number of countries remain locked inprolonged conflict  which has smothered the democraticprocess and stalled the development effort. We urge theinternational community to do all it can to stem theexplosive situation in the Great Lakes region. Withoutpeace there can be no development  and withoutdevelopment there can be no lasting peace. We thereforehope for an early breakthrough for peace in affectedcountries  not only in Africa but also in other regions of theworld  so that the urgent task of development can beresumed.In our own hemisphere  the situation in Haiti continuesto be of special concern to countries of the Latin Americanand Caribbean region. Thanks to the resolve of the Haitianpeople and the support of the international community  aviable political and development infrastructure has begun totake root. It holds the promise of nurturing the still-fragiledemocracy and accelerating economic and social progresswhich has eluded the majority of the Haitian people for toolong. Speaking on behalf of member States of theCaribbean Community during consideration of this questionat the fiftieth session  Barbados cautioned that the roadahead for Haiti would be long and difficult  that progresswould be uneven  and that sustained support from theinternational community would continue to be crucial.We believe that this view is still valid. My delegationtherefore welcomes the adoption of Security Councilresolution 1063 (1996) of 28 June 1996  which establishedthe United Nations Support Mission in Haiti until 30November 1996. It will provide continuing support tosecure and maintain a stable environment that will buttressthe democratic and development process. However  comenext month  the international community cannot wash itshands of Haiti  declare victory and leave. As recent eventshave shown  stability  to say nothing of democracy  remainsa fragile sapling that will continue to require care andprotection. We urge that Haitians  who were among the firstin this hemisphere to attempt to define their own post-colonial political system  not be forgotten in the post-cold-war world.Developing countries look to a reformed UnitedNations to play a major role in shaping the global societyof the twenty-first century. It must build on theconsiderable policy consensus that already exists on thebroad priorities of its agenda  including the link betweenpeace and development  poverty eradication  sustainabledevelopment  social justice and democracy  issues ofgovernance  and women. It must continue to nurture theparticipatory impulse of civil society  which has emerged asa major influence on the work of the Organization and onnational public policy. It must propel this heightenedconcern with the human condition in all its dimensions tothe top of the global agenda.Barbados shares these priorities for full humandevelopment by fostering the empowerment of all itspeople as it expands its economic and social development.At the same time  it has taken steps to review and deepenits democratic and human rights traditions through theestablishment of Commissions on Social Justice andReform of the Constitution  respectively. These inquirieswill assess the extent to which the promise of a good andjust society has been fulfilled after 30 years ofindependence. They reflect the fact that we assign thehighest priority to social policy and to the cause of humanrights and democracy.The United Nations faces many challenges  but theseare not insurmountable if we renew our faith in itsmission. Barbados believes that this Organization is stillour best hope for fostering peace and social justice andfor coordinating the management of global problems.Given the agenda before us  we believe this is a time formore  not less  intensive global cooperation —cooperation that only the United Nations can foster. Weremain committed to its principles and will do our part tohelp fulfil the promise of the Charter."
"26",1037,"BRN",51,1996,"﻿Itis a very special pleasure for Brunei Darussalam to greetyou  Mr. President  as a close friend and neighbour.Please accept our warmest congratulations  both to you7and to all Malaysians  on your election. May I also expressour appreciation to His Excellency Mr. Freitas do Amaralfor his leadership during our fiftieth session.Our fiftieth anniversary has come and gone. We stillremember the many fine statements made last year. Now however  we have to give them practical substance. In thisregard  Mr. President  I was very interested in your recentstatements on the role of the General Assembly. I wasparticularly pleased that you emphasized practical economicand social development.It was also most encouraging to hear you say that youintend to do all you can for the cause of United Nationsreform. Like you  I feel that the General Assembly mustnot be paralysed by the analysis of reform. We needconcrete proposals from our working groups. Then we canspend our time on the hard work of building consensus.The need is urgent. Tension and conflict withinnations are growing. At the same time  the United Nationsis increasingly being asked to solve problems in many newareas of international concern — social  economic andsometimes even criminal — that transcend national borders.It is also expected to address the deep-seated causes offuture instability  the widening gap between North andSouth and the allied problems of overpopulation andurbanization  which have been so sharply exposed by thisOrganization at recent conferences. Above all  it has to facethe results of these problems in the form of mountingintolerance  violent aggression and  all too often  extremismand terrorism.In trying to do all this  its resources are overstretched.For this reason  I would like to thank the Secretary-General his representatives and all those who are serving thisOrganization in the field  often in extremely difficultconditions. Their work represents a deep commitment to thecause of peace and stability in the world and I admire andgreatly appreciate it. However  I also tend to think thatmaybe we are asking them to take on new tasks with old oroutdated tools. If they are not provided with the means tomanage our affairs well  then we in the United Nations areat fault.In this respect  the tragedy of Bosnia is a warning tous. Certainly  we in Brunei Darussalam welcome recentdevelopments and will continue to give our strong supportto the new Government in Bosnia. At the same time  I feelthat all of us in this Assembly should recognize the extentto which the events of the last five years reveal our ownshortcomings.We hope that the Security Council will now begin toinsist that all agreements be resolutely kept. We wouldlike to see it acting firmly against political pressure fromany quarter and ensuring that nothing is allowed to standin the way of the peoples’ recovery.I say this with particular concern as we are nowfacing what could become another emblem of failure forus: the current situation in the Middle East. Until quiterecently  this was a problem which had defied solutionsince the earliest days of this Organization. Then  at last a peace agreement was reached which gave us a realisticglimpse of hope. Even though we realized that it wouldbe a very difficult process  we felt optimistic. However a new Government in Israel now appears to bechallenging the very basis on which our own hopes forpeace were founded. The solutions that appeared to bewithin the grasp of the parties directly concerned areunder threat. Rather than becoming more manageable  thescope of the so-called Middle East problem has nowextended to include the people of Iraq.It is consequently with great concern that BruneiDarussalam adds its voice to the many who wish toimpress on the leaders of Israel the need to continue thepeace process  not just by making statements  but in thefull spirit of the agreements reached in Madrid and Oslo.What I have briefly described represents the sum ofeconomic  social and political problems  which in ourview calls for a new approach on our part. This can onlybe developed  we feel  when the United Nations isreformed. I say this because we are seeing the emergenceof a new type of international community  far morediverse than the one our founders knew. At the sametime  it is one which is being drawn even closer togetherthrough the advance of technology andcommunications — the “global village” of populardescription.There are many reasons to welcome this. It couldmean that we all learn to acknowledge and appreciate ourdiversity and to take on the best aspects of a real village.However  there is no guarantee. Villages are not alwayspleasant places to live in. They have their darker side.Modern technology may well encourage neighbourlycooperation  but it is just as capable of enhancing thehostile elements of primitive village life. It could set upa permanent division between the developed and thedeveloping worlds.8That is why I feel it is essential for us to find aneffective new approach to the tremendous changes takingplace today. As members know  this is what we are tryingto develop in South-East Asia. The way we have chosenhas enabled us to promote programmes aimed at preventivediplomacy and economic cooperation in our region. It hasalso meant that we have been able to offer some widerassistance to the cause of South-South cooperation.These are specific measures with practical aims andthey are producing clear results  but they also have abroader and deeper effect. They enable us not only tomanage the diversity of our region  but also  at a veryhuman level  to learn to appreciate each others’ differencesand enjoy the challenge of working together.By way of example  I would like to commend ourfriends and colleagues in Cambodia  Laos and Myanmar fortheir intention to join the Association of South-East AsianNations (ASEAN). They are making a lasting contributionto peace and stability in our region. We are thereforedelighted to be on the verge of seeing the whole of South-East Asia working together in cooperation.What this has led to in terms of strengtheninginternational peace and security is illustrated by our veryextensive dialogue process. One practical result of this inour region was the signing of the South-East Asia Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty at the last ASEAN summit. Thisis a Treaty which we would like all nuclear-weapon Statesto join as a commitment to peace in our region. It was inthis spirit that we endorsed the resolution on theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty  passed by thisAssembly earlier this month  as a first step towardsworldwide nuclear disarmament.What we are trying to stress is the need for inclusion drawing together all parties to a problem  working towardsconsensus rather than demanding compromise and bringingeveryone into the mainstream of decision-making. The kindof results we hope for were shown just this month in theachievements of the Government of the Philippines and theleaders of the Moro National Liberation Front through thegood offices of Indonesia. Their efforts brought to an endmore than 20 years of violence and hostility  and I wouldlike to congratulate all the parties involved.We see this as reflecting the need that lies behind thestrong calls that many Member States have made for reformof this Organization. It acknowledges that aggression mustbe dealt with firmly  but it also recognizes what has beentragically impressed upon us all over the past few years inEurope  Africa and Asia. It is what guides all our work inour region and  I suggest  must be the starting point forany new approach to the conduct of international affairstoday. It is the knowledge that  if we do not accept andwillingly embrace diversity  there is a price to be paidand it is unacceptable."
"27",1079,"BTN",51,1996,"﻿I have the honour to conveyto the President and all the members the warm greetingsand good wishes of His Majesty Jigme Singye Wangchuck King of Bhutan  for the success of the fifty-first session ofthe United Nations General Assembly.We congratulate Ambassador Razali on his unanimouselection as President of the fifty-first session of the GeneralAssembly. We are happy that a close friend of Bhutan ispresiding over our deliberations. We are fully aware of hiswide experience and deep interest in the United Nations. Heis not only an outspoken critic of the shortcomings of theUnited Nations but is also one of its greatest supporters and we look to this session with high expectations.I would like to express our deepest appreciation to HisExcellency Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral for the exemplarymanner in which he conducted the Special CommemorativeMeeting of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nationsand the fiftieth session of the General Assembly. I am alsograteful for the privilege of having had the opportunity toserve in his Bureau.We would also like to take this opportunity to pay aspecial tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. BoutrosBoutros-Ghali  for his leadership in steering the UnitedNations through a period of many challenges and changes.Twenty-five years ago  on 21 September 1971  Bhutanbecame a Member of the United Nations. That day saw thefulfilment of a long-cherished dream and was a historicoccasion on which the people of Bhutan joined hands withthe international community. We have since taken greatpride in our membership of the world body and have madegreat strides. Bhutan has stepped forward to take anactive role by seeking membership in all major UnitedNations and other international bodies including theBretton Woods institutions. Our membership of theUnited Nations has provided us with the opportunity toparticipate in all international discussions of importance.Our participation  which we consider both a privilege andan obligation  has always been guided by a positiveattitude  seeking to contribute constructively and fairly.On the part of the international community  Bhutanhas received an outpouring of goodwill and friendship.The United Nations and its agencies have come to ourassistance with enthusiasm and dedication. Every sectorin Bhutan has received the benefit of United Nationsassistance  and the lives of the people of Bhutan havegreatly improved. Today  the development of Bhutan restsin the hands of young Bhutanese  many of whom weretrained through United Nations assistance. I take thisopportunity to put on record the heartfelt gratitude of thepeople of Bhutan to the United Nations and internationalinstitutions  in particular the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme  the United Nations Children’s Fund  theUnited Nations Population Fund  the United NationsCapital Development Fund  the International Fund forAgricultural Development  the World Food Programme the United Nations Volunteers programme  the Food andAgriculture Organization of the United Nations  the WorldHealth Organization  the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization  the World Bank andthe African Development Bank  many of which have beenworking constructively in Bhutan for the last 25 years.Bhutan takes the opportunity of the twenty-fifthanniversary of our membership to rededicate ourselves tothe principles of the United Nations and its Charter. Aswe rededicate ourselves to the United Nations and expressour support and gratitude  we are conscious of the factthat the United Nations is at a crossroads  and that thereis a struggle for the heart and soul of the Organization.The world has changed  and the United Nations too mustchange to meet the new realities.Today we would like to confine our remarks to afew areas which we feel need to be addressed in theprocess of reform and in preparing the United Nations forthe next century.The increase in membership from the original 51Members to the current 185 is the clearest indication thatthe United Nations is truly a global body. Therepresentation and participation of all United Nations15Members in the General Assembly give true meaning andlegitimacy to the United Nations  yet increasingly theGeneral Assembly has little influence in the work of theUnited Nations. The role of the Assembly must beenhanced. It must become the centre of the United Nationsand the source of both its moral and real authority. In orderto do this  the General Assembly must change its ownworking methods  and its debates and agenda must be mademore meaningful. It must become the point from which allUnited Nations policies emanate. The General Assembly’srelations with other principal organs and bodies of theUnited Nations must be streamlined and strengthened.The structure of other principal organs such as theEconomic and Social Council must also be reviewed. Inmany of the principal organs  subsidiary bodies andcommissions have taken a more prominent role than theorgans themselves. While we agree that the more detailedwork of implementing the technical aspects must bedevolved to commissions and subsidiary bodies  policiesmust be made by the principal organs themselves. Manyhere will agree that the subsidiary bodies  committees groups  and so forth  are too numerous to keep track of  letalone participate in. All United Nations bodies must finallybe made accountable to the General Assembly. Unless thislinkage is strengthened  many Members will be excludedfrom the activities of the United Nations. For many smallerMembers  the possibility of being elected to andparticipating in many United Nations bodies is limited.Therefore  the General Assembly is of paramountimportance for enhancing the participation and role ofMember countries.In the area of peace and security  there is increasingconcern that the United Nations is unable to maintain peaceand provide security  particularly for its smaller and morevulnerable Members. This view seems to persist despite anumber of successful interventions by the United Nations.There is growing frustration that the Security Council  theonly body of the United Nations with any real authority  isunable to respond to the challenges posed by the presentconflicts  and that the Security Council is primarily drivenby the views of its major members. The need for reformand expansion is more and more keenly felt. In our view there must be an increase in the number of both permanentand non-permanent members. Developing countries anddeserving countries from all regions must be included in theranks of permanent members. Using the objective criteriaof equitable distribution  the ability to contribute to thework of the United Nations and the maintenance ofinternational peace and security  Bhutan believes that Indiaand Japan qualify for permanent membership of theSecurity Council.Expansion alone is not sufficient. The decision-making process of the Security Council  its relations withthe General Assembly  and other powers such as the vetoand the Council’s virtual hold over the appointment ofjudges of the International Court of Justice and otherimportant positions in the United Nations  must bereviewed.Progress towards a world free of tension can only bemade with disarmament that includes all types ofweapons. While various steps have been taken towardseasing the nuclear threat  no significant progress towardsthe goal of the complete elimination of all nuclearweapons has been made. We must not lose sight of theprimary objective of the complete elimination of nuclearweapons. The disarmament dialogue must include allparties and address the genuine concerns of everyMember State.A brisk international business in conventional armscontinues to pose a threat to peace and security. As longas there is an unlimited supply of arms  their use in thesettlement of disputes will continue. We must expand ourinitiatives at the United Nations to control the global armstrade. Bhutan supports the steps taken towards theelimination of chemical and biological weapons. TheUnited Nations Register of Conventional Arms is a usefulstep. Efforts must also be redoubled to bring about amoratorium on the manufacture  sale and deployment ofanti-personnel landmines  with the objective ofeliminating this weapon which kills indiscriminately.With the major agreements and common groundarrived at during the United Nations global conferences ofthe 1990s  it was hoped that the stage had been set forfresh impetus and a new direction in internationaldevelopment. In reality the new era of development hascontinued to elude us.There is an emerging consensus that the newapproach to development must be to concentrate on thewell-being of the individual person and to release theproductive capacity of the human spirit and of nationsthrough social development  free markets  internationaltrade and investment. While this strategy has broughtprogress to many countries  many poorer developingcountries have not been able to compete and benefit  dueto structural inadequacies in their economies or becauseof the small size of their markets.16To adapt to the new approaches to development  allUnited Nations agencies have to undergo major changes intheir organization and operations. However  the resourcesavailable to United Nations agencies have declined both inactual and real terms. Many of them are unable to carry outprogrammes at the level of previous cycles. In thesecircumstances  many of the targets set in the major globalconferences  whether in health  environment  population education  or other social fields  may not be met.It is often said that the overall contribution of UnitedNations agencies to a country’s development is small.While this may be the case in larger countries  it should bepointed out that in many smaller countries the input ofUnited Nations agencies plays a substantial role. It isunfortunate that the most far-reaching responsibility of theUnited Nations  which can make a lasting impact inimproving the lives of millions of people  is beingconstrained and reduced at a time when more efforts arenecessary.The efforts of the United Nations development bodiesare of particular importance to the 48 least developedcountries. It has become increasingly difficult for theconcerns and needs of these countries to find a place in theinternational development dialogue. The United Nations through the United Nations Conference on Trade andDevelopment and all other agencies  must ensure that thesituation and the needs of the least developed countries arekept in focus and as part of any agenda for development.Otherwise we risk the further marginalization of asignificant number of countries.The United Nations development agencies must ensurethat the resources they spend in finding and developing newideas and approaches are balanced and matched byprogrammes and resources in the field. The agencies anddeveloping countries must work closely together in order toregain the confidence of the donor community. Bhutanstrongly believes that the special role that manydevelopment agencies fulfil must not be allowed todiminish due to a lack of funds.Bhutan recognizes that developing countries mustwork closely with other major participants in theinternational development effort  such as financialinstitutions  bilateral donors and the world businesscommunity. Bhutan has greatly benefitted from thecontributions and efforts of our bilateral donors. Theirassistance has been utilized effectively and has contributedmeaningfully to our development. We take this opportunityto express our gratitude to our bilateral donors  in particularIndia  Switzerland  Japan  Denmark  the Netherlands Austria  Norway  Kuwait  Germany  Australia andThailand  for their cooperation and generous assistance.Allow me to express a few thoughts concerning theimpact of reform on the United Nations. We are awarethat the issue of reforming the United Nations system andits organizational structure is not new  and that it wasraised just a few years after the establishment of theUnited Nations itself. However  the issue oforganizational reform has taken on special significance inthe last few years  given the financial situation of theUnited Nations and some of its major agencies. While thedialogue on reform of the United Nations continues  theOrganization has had to implement major cuts in staff andactivities. The morale of the international civil servantshas been greatly affected. This situation should not beallowed to continue for long. All Member countries musttake cognizance of these facts  work towards completingthe reform process  and place the Organization on a firmfinancial footing at an early date.We must not be afraid of reform and change. Majorchanges have already been carried out  and there are stillmany areas which need to be addressed. However  it isour view that the process of reform of the Organizationshould be time-bound. A long  drawn out process with noend in sight will hinder the Organization in effectivelycarrying out the vast responsibilities we have assigned toit.The calls for change and reform of the UnitedNations  in their own way  are the best indicator of thestrong support of its Members. The United Nations todayhas become an indispensable institution in internationalrelations and development. It is up to us  the MemberStates  to ensure that it will be able to meet theaspirations and expectations of all its Members  large andsmall. It must become the source of inspiration for all anda guiding beacon that will take the world to the nextmillennium of peace and prosperity for all the peoplesand nations of the world."
"28",1120,"BWA",51,1996,"﻿I am delighted to extendto the President and his country  Malaysia  the sincerecongratulations of the Government and the people ofBotswana on his assumption of the presidency of theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-first session. His record asan accomplished diplomat has the admiration of mydelegation. He can therefore count on the full support andcooperation of the delegation of Botswana in thedischarge of his demanding responsibilities.We salute his predecessor  His ExcellencyMr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral  for his successfulstewardship of the fiftieth session and the SpecialCommemorative Meeting.The last five years have been the most momentousin the history of the United Nations  imposing on theworld body enormous responsibilities  which theSecretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  and the Secretariat have carried out with a deepsense of commitment and dedication. We assure them thatthey continue to enjoy the confidence and full support ofBotswana in the execution of their duties.The African continent continues to makecommendable progress in the consolidation of freedomand democracy. This year the continent witnessed thesuccessful holding of multi-party elections in Benin Sierra Leone and the United Republic of Tanzania.The right of citizens to organize themselves andparticipate freely in the political processes of theircountries  and respect for human rights  form the basis forstability  democracy and development.23Indeed  the continent has increasingly embraced theseuniversal values  which are an integral part of a democraticculture. Not only has Africa embraced political pluralism accountability and good governance  it has alsodemonstrated its readiness to defend these principles.A year ago we expected that the people of Angolawould by now have started a new chapter of peace in thehistory of their country. It is regrettable that to date the wayforward remains unclear. We strongly call upon those whohave contributed to the current stalemate in Angola to seereason and show more commitment to the peace process.Two days ago the Heads of State and Government ofsouthern Africa met in Luanda  Angola  in an effort topersuade all concerned to ensure the speedy implementationof the Lusaka Protocol.We are deeply concerned about the situation inBurundi. The country is wallowing in a quagmire of self-destruction. No amount of reasoning and persuasion hasthus far succeeded in drawing the political leaders inBurundi away from a path of mutual annihilation and to thepath of accommodation and reconciliation.We salute the efforts of the regional leaders and of theinternational community aimed at ensuring the restorationof democracy and constitutional order in Burundi. Thatsister country deserves some reprieve from the traumaticexperience it has recently gone through. Burundi needspeace and stability now  not tomorrow.While the situation in Rwanda remains tense  there aresome encouraging signs that the country is making steadyprogress towards normalcy. Preparations for next year’sgeneral elections seem to be well under way.We urge the international community to spare noeffort in encouraging that country towards nationalreconciliation. Key among the necessary measures to beundertaken is the safe return of refugees to their homeland.Despite all efforts by the international community  andby West Africa in particular  the political crisis in Liberiahas so far eluded solution. We call upon all the partiesconcerned to ensure that elections are held in May 1997 asscheduled.In our view  and in reality  Western Sahara poses amajor political and moral problem. Botswana is committedto the holding of a free  fair and impartial referendum forthe people of Western Sahara  in accordance with theSettlement Plan. We are deeply concerned that theidentification process has been in a state of paralysis forseveral months now.Somalia continues to haunt the conscience of theworld. The situation in that country is a tragicdemonstration of how a disparate assortment of gunmencan hijack and destroy a nation. The United Nationsshould not consider Somalia a lost cause. We shouldtherefore persevere in the search for a comprehensivesettlement to the political crisis in that country.Recent developments in the Middle East are a matterof profound concern to Botswana. Starting in September1993 we were pleased to witness the dramatic unfoldingof a promising peace process between Israel and thePalestinians  on the one hand  and between Israel andJordan  on the other. We looked forward to theresumption of negotiations between Israel and its Arabneighbours  Syria and Lebanon  which  hopefully  wouldhave ushered in a lasting solution to the conflict in theMiddle East.Recent events in the occupied Arab territories are astark indicator of what can happen to the peace process ifthings are allowed to drag on and on. We appeal to theGovernment of Israel to fulfil its obligations under theagreements it signed with the Palestinians.Developments on the Korean peninsula have alsobeen a matter of grave concern. Botswana is committedto the peaceful reunification of Korea.Botswana follows developments in Cyprus with keeninterest. The continued division of Cyprus is a seriousviolation of the unity  sovereignty and territorial integrityof a Member State of the United Nations.Land-mines  particularly anti-personnel land-mines are a major threat to humanity. Botswana stronglybelieves that the solution to the menace of anti-personnelland-mines lies in a total ban on production  stockpiling export and use. Existing protocols have provided only apartial solution to this problem. There is a glaring needfor a binding international legal instrument for theprogressive and ultimate elimination of these weapons.The production  stockpiling and proliferation ofweapons of mass destruction  of which nuclear weaponsare the most lethal  is also a matter of deep concern tomy delegation. For far too long  non-nuclear-weaponStates have been calling for an international legalinstrument to safeguard them against the threat or use of24these weapons. The response of the nuclear Powers hasbeen less than reassuring  to say the least. Unilateralstatements on security assurances  which have beentransmitted through a Security Council resolution  do notmeet the demands of the overwhelming majority of themembership of this Organization.The security of non-nuclear-weapon States from thethreat or use of these dangerous weapons can only beguaranteed by the institution of a legally bindinginternational instrument. Botswana is committed to the earlyconclusion of such an instrument  and we hope that thenuclear-weapon States will demonstrate the necessarycommitment to meet the concerns of non-nuclear-weaponStates.Article VI of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation ofNuclear Weapons commits parties  inter alia  to reachagreement“on a Treaty on general and complete disarmamentunder strict and effective international control”.Unfortunately  the nuclear-weapon States are resolutelyopposed to the total elimination of nuclear weapons. Notonly are these States resistant to this noble ideal  but theycontinue to develop new types of weapons. Whatconclusions are we expected to draw from this state ofaffairs?It is difficult for nuclear-weapon States to claim themoral high ground to dissuade any State from acquiring thesame weapons for the defence of its supreme nationalinterests  while they themselves consider such weapons areliable means of self-defence. Nuclear-weapon Statesshould accept their responsibility to enter into and concludenegotiations for the elimination of these weapons.The General Assembly has repeatedly called upon theConference on Disarmament to accelerate consideration ofthe question of the expansion of its membership. We thuscall upon the Conference on Disarmament to addressspeedily the question of its expansion to the satisfaction ofthe general membership of the United Nations.Five years have passed since the United Nations NewAgenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s wasadopted by the General Assembly. While we all applaudedthe adoption of the New Agenda  it has to be accepted thatthe necessary operational framework was never put in placeto ensure effective mobilization and disbursement of thetarget resources.Concerned about the poor performance of the UnitedNations New Agenda  in March this year the Secretary-General launched the United Nations System-wide SpecialInitiative for Africa  which has the backing of the WorldBank  among others. The Initiative envisages anexpenditure of some $25 billion over a 10-year period toaddress identified sectoral development priorities. This isa laudable Initiative which should afford Africa theopportunity to address effectively the critical nexus offood security  population and the environment.For their part  most African countries have met theirobligations as spelled out in national structural adjustmentprogrammes  in addition to the efforts made in the fieldsof democracy  human rights and good governance.Although southern Africa today enjoys relative peace andstability  it will continue to need special assistance inorder to address the problems of reconstruction anddevelopment of the economic  physical and socialinfrastructures which were destroyed or adversely affectedby many years of war and racial injustice. We have nodoubt that the international community will complementour efforts so that we can launch our region on a firmroad to regional integration and economic development.Botswana is a strong proponent of the reform andrestructuring of the United Nations. My President  who isa member of the Secretary-General’s United NationsPanel of High-level Personalities on AfricanDevelopment  firmly believes in a more action-orientedand streamlined United Nations system that is able todeliver. But we do not agree with those who advocate a“cut-cut” approach. There could be areas where additionalstaff could be the catalyst to enhanced effectiveness andefficiency. What the world needs is a United Nations thathas the capacity to implement its programmes andprojects effectively and efficiently  a United Nations thatcan put to better use the human and material resources atits disposal and one that can better guarantee internationalpeace and security and promote internationalunderstanding.It should be noted that the responsibility for thereform process  to a large extent  lies squarely withMember States and not with the Secretary-General although he has a contribution to make in the wholeprocess. Member States should therefore take fullresponsibility for their inability to reach agreement onvarious aspects of the reform process and desist fromseeking scapegoats for their failure to reach consensus ona multifaceted international and structural reform of theOrganization.25Botswana and other countries in southern Africa havenot been spared the scourge of illicit drug trafficking andconsumption. The Heads of State or Government of theSouthern African Development Community recently signed among other instruments  a protocol on illicit drugtrafficking. The aim is to pool our resources — such aspolice forces  customs authorities and drug enforcementagencies — to fight drug trafficking and other cross-bordercrimes effectively. We look forward to continuedinternational cooperation in this regard. We are hopefulthat these efforts will be crowned with success and willreceive the full support and cooperation of theinternational community.The human immunodeficiency virus and acquiredimmune deficiency syndrome pandemic is another scourgeof our time and a serious threat to humanity. The socio-economic consequences of the disease are a matter ofgrave concern  and the international community shouldmake concerted efforts to address this human tragedy —which affects the young and the productive sectors of oursocieties in particular — before it is too late.To conclude  my delegation reaffirms its totalconfidence in the stewardship of the President of theGeneral Assembly and pledges its loyalty andcooperation. We reaffirm our commitment to work withother delegations towards the strengthening of the UnitedNations. We reaffirm our confidence in the manner inwhich the Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. BoutrosBoutros-Ghali  manages the affairs of our Organization.We salute him for his visionary leadership and untiringcommitment to duty."
"29",1163,"CAF",51,1996,"﻿On behalf of the delegation of the CentralAfrican Republic  I should like to express our warmestand most heartfelt congratulations to Mr. Razali Ismail onhis election to the presidency of this session. His provenskill in international affairs assures us that our work willbe crowned with success. I would assure him of mydelegation’s cooperation.19We also wish to extend to the outgoing President Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral  the deepest appreciation ofthe delegation of the Central African Republic for thecompetence with which he served the Organizationthroughout his mandate.Lastly  I should like to pay a heartfelt tribute to theSecretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. BoutrosBoutros-Ghali  for his courageous and tireless work  workwhich does honour to Africa and which is often performedin a hostile context  to have the principles of the UnitedNations Charter prevail in all circumstances. The work ofour Secretary-General deserves to be encouraged and mustcontinue.The evaluation of the United Nations 50 years ofexistence revealed the Organization’s continuingshortcomings in the accomplishment of its mission.However  the end of the cold war  which allowed us toglimpse a new era in international relations  openedprospects for renewed cooperation commensurate with thehopes that emerged at the end of the world’s division intoblocs. In that connection  the United Nations was at last torediscover its capacity to handle relations among States onthe sole basis of the application of the principles that havebrought us together here in this Hall.Opposing tendencies continue to vie for attention at atime when we must  with shared resolution  ensure respectfor an international rule of law. The world today haschanged. The aspiration to wider freedom and greaterrecognition of equality is stronger than ever before.Thus  the delegation of the Central African Republicbelieves that the shortcomings and limitations of ourOrganization  like those inherent in any human endeavour must be rectified  and they can be  if States give priority toconcerted action  to dialogue and a shared search forsolutions to the world’s problems. Together  we will bebetter able to establish the universal values of the UnitedNations. Indeed  that is our principal task.The wider advent of democracy  its affirmation and itsimplantation are of course primarily the choice of a people.However  democracy  which is a universal value  is also thestruggle of all democratically minded people who share itsideals  and the struggle of the United Nations  whose veryestablishment was a response to an international order ofdictatorship and terror with the tragic consequences we allknown. We are therefore in duty bound to create truesolidarity so as to ensure the defence and spread ofdemocracy.This is an appropriate time for me to dwell for amoment on the case of my own country  the CentralAfrican Republic.In the space of one month  a country that wasalready very far advanced in negotiations to conclude anagreement with the Bretton Woods institutions was toundergo two mutinies that proved to be attempts at coupsd’états. The world was presented with a shocking andunfamiliar picture of my country  erasing the efforts ofthe national community to turn its back on its past andwiping out the efforts of Central Africans to devotethemselves  within the framework of their sovereignchoice  to the search for the means of developing theCentral African Republic  with its vast potential inmining  agriculture and livestock and with its abundantrainfall.There were deaths  there was destruction  but aboveall there was an attempt  by force of arms  to impose thewill of a tiny fraction of the nation on the majority. Thelong struggle of the Central African nation freely tochoose its leaders at the ballot box was about to beobliterated without any legitimacy or legality whatsoever.Central African democracy is three years old. It isdeveloping in very difficult economic circumstances  andit must find within itself the necessary spirit ofconfidence  solidarity  hard work and organization. Theaffairs of state of this young democracy must be given thetransparency needed for good governance and theconfidence to build at last a country whose potential willenable it to provide its children with a healthy future.That is the constant message that President Ange-Félix Patassé  our Head of State  has expressed to hiscompatriots ever since assuming office in the CentralAfrican Republic. But there is still a long road to follow and one strewn with pitfalls  before we can arrive at thetranquillity of older democracies that makes militaryadventurism inadmissible.While this destiny is mainly the responsibility ofeach country  the Central African Republic believes thatdefence of the universal values of freedom and equalityis also the responsibility of all democrats  whether or notthey are States. That is why I would like to take thisopportunity to express the gratitude of the Government ofthe Central African Republic to those friendly countries especially France  the United States of America Germany  Gabon  Chad  Zaire  Congo  Senegal  Togo Benin  Mali  Côte d’Ivoire and Sudan  which gave their20support  in the name of the principles of democracy  to thechoices of the Central African Republic and its institutionsduring this difficult period. That same appreciation isextended to the Secretary-General of the OAU  and aboveall to the Secretary-General of the United Nations  for hisunambiguous and courageous position in defence ofdemocracy.Collectively  the Central Africans overcame thisdifficult stage in the history of their country because indark moments they always had the spirit to find a solutionto preserve the essential  the unity of the country reinforced by a common language  Sango.Since then  the Central African Republic has beenworking to find ways and means to strengthen the peaceand security it has restored. Hence  with the participation offriendly countries such as France  Gabon  Senegal  and Mali(with the contribution of its former President AmadouToumani Toure)  the Government has organized nationalstructures for defence. It recently convened an importantseminar  with the support of the United States of Americaon the role of the military in a democracy. This meetingserved to draw attention to the place of the army within thenation; in other words  in a republic the armed forces mustbe under civil authority.Another dimension of restoring peace and security isthe relaunching of the economy. My country wishes to paytribute to the promptness with which countries such asFrance  the Republic of China and Germany and bodiessuch as the United Nations  through the United NationsDevelopment Programme (UNDP) intervened  eitherproviding direct support for the re launch or helping todevelop an emergency programme leading to a jointmeeting of donors in Bangui. The pledges made during thatmeeting were encouraging and we hope for further suchoffers of support during the round table planned for 1997.But it is the intention of the President of the Republic Ange-Félix Patassé  to reach an agreement with theInternational Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Thisintention has been repeated and will be pursued.The course taken in international relations since theend of the cold war should prompt States to turn tomultilateral cooperation and United Nations principlesshould come fully into play in crisis settlement. This shouldapply to the question of the Middle East  where the currentpeace process must be pursued and concluded withoutdelay. It should also apply to the situation in Rwanda andBurundi  where regional initiatives must also back upinternational efforts  in the Western Sahara  in Angola andin Liberia  where it should be possible to implement theUnited Nations plan of action.The firm political will of all continues to benecessary to achieve this  with a constant search formechanisms that build and strengthen confidence amongStates. In this respect  the signing of the non-aggressionpact among States members of the United NationsStanding Advisory Committee on Questions of Securityin Central Africa will certainly contribute  if observed  topreserving good-neighbourly relations among thesignatories and will free the dynamic elements in one ofthe richest regions of the world for integrateddevelopment efforts.In that same spirit  during this session the CentralAfrican Republic intends to sign the ComprehensiveNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty  which it fully supported at thedraft stage.Political will presupposes the strengthening of theUnited Nations authority and its universal nature. Thatauthority flows from its rightful place in the world  aworld that has changed to such an extent since theestablishment of the United Nations that the workingmethods of its organs need to be adapted. The UnitedNations is no longer accorded the status it had during thedecolonization movement. There has been a loss of regardfor the United Nations  especially since the division of theworld into hostile blocs came to an end. States particularly the powerful ones  prefer to resolve problemsoutside the United Nations  or consider that theOrganization should merely endorse their decisions. TheUnited Nations should not be used as a tool in this way;therein lies the root cause of the powerlessness of whichit stands accused.The restructuring efforts begun two years ago mustbe pursued and stressed in order to achieve rational andreal structural reforms allowing the Organization tooperate more efficiently in various areas  beginning withthe Security Council. The Security Council should includecountries from both the North and South that can providethe financial and political resources needed by theOrganization to defend peace. From this standpoint  theCentral African Republic delegation supports theinitiatives taken by Germany and Japan. The economicweight of these countries and their activities to promotedevelopment and peace give them an outstanding place ininternational cooperation today.21What is more  the democratization of internationalrelations also involves a strengthening of the universalistnature of our Organization  because the United Nations with its mission to bring together all States and civilizationsof the world  can no longer refuse to admit States especially if those States are able to meet the obligationsinherent in the status of Member.I should like to raise here the question of the Republicof China in Taiwan. My delegation regrets that thisquestion is once again not on our agenda this year. Yet thefirst consequence of the end of the cold war was thereassessment of questions associated with this period  forexample the issues related to General Assembly resolution2758 (XXVI)  which artificially deprives the Republic ofChina of its place in the United Nations. This is a flagrantinjustice that should be redressed by the internationalcommunity  which can surely not allow a sovereign andindependent State  in which free and democratic electionshave recently been held  to be indefinitely excluded  withits 21 million inhabitants  from United Nations activities.The European Parliament has recognized this. Last July itadopted a proposed joint resolution requesting the UnitedNations to study the possibility of participation by theRepublic of China in the activities of bodies that report tothe General Assembly.Furthermore  there are many challenges facing theworld today requiring the general mobilization of all States including the Republic of China  whose participation inefforts for peace and development throughout the world isalready highly appreciated. The delegation of the CentralAfrican Republic therefore appeals to the GeneralAssembly’s wisdom and realism and invites it to examinethe question during its next session so that the Republic ofChina in Taiwan can resume its seat in the United Nations.It has been said time and again that the world hasbecome a global village  characterized by an interminglingof cultures  ideas  economies  markets  norms of behaviourand the ever more rapid coming together of peoples  despitethe barriers imposed by frontiers. My delegation believesthat the acceleration of the process of globalization willlead to an increasingly integrated approach to developmentmanagement so as to find a global solution.Given the proliferation of internal conflicts andregional tensions  the harmful effects of economic disorder the spread of the AIDS pandemic  the rise of crime andterrorism  violations of human rights  the ever-wideninginternational character of drug-trafficking networks and thedeterioration of the environment  there is no single area ofinternational relations that does not require a collectiveeffort on the part of States if it is to be mastered.The Central African Republic would like toemphasize the issue of the AIDS pandemic. This problemrequires the keen attention of the entire internationalcommunity  because no solution is near. The small sizeand youthfulness of the country’s population explain whythe Government is paying special attention to thispandemic  and to the question of health in general. Thatis why we believe that agencies such as the World HealthOrganization  the United Nations Children’s Fund and theUnited Nations Population Fund must be encouraged.For the delegation of the Central African Republicthe hope that has been placed in the will of States tomobilize for this vast international cooperative action willtruly make it possible to embark on the second 50 yearsof the United Nations in a way that will avoid the pitfallsexperienced during the first 50 years of its existence.In our lives as human beings there are always timeswhen we need to look within ourselves  and at ourexistence  to see exactly what must be done and in whatdirection to go. It is the responsibility of States to makeof the United Nations what they want it to be  takingaccount of its failings  weaknesses  limits andshortcomings.States today must do all they can  with a constanteffort of political will  to support our Organization so thatmultilateral cooperation has full scope. The defence ofpeace and the promotion of sustainable developmentduring this time of globalization cannot succeedotherwise.The delegation of the Central African Republicwould like to share with the other members of theinternational community the hope that  during the next 50years  the world will embark resolutely on the path laiddown by the founding fathers of the Organization. Animportant part of the attainment of the principles andvalues of the Charter will be the implementation of theproposals made by our22dynamic Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros-Ghali  through theAgenda for Peace  the Agenda for Development and  aboveall  the United Nations System-wide Special Initiative onAfrica."
"30",1209,"CAN",51,1996,"﻿I am happy to join otherspeakers in warmly congratulating His Excellency Mr.Razali Ismail on his assumption of the presidency of theGeneral Assembly. I also wish to express Canada’s deepappreciation of the excellent manner in which Mr. Freitasdo Amaral managed the deliberations of the fiftiethsession of the Assembly.Forty years ago  in the depths of the cold war  theGeneral Assembly authorized the setting up of apeacekeeping force in Suez. Thus emerged an importanttool for the international community  one that has sinceserved the cause of peace in many different forms aroundthe world.(spoke in French)Canadians take special pride in peacekeepingbecause the concept was developed in part by theirForeign Minister  Lester B. Pearson  who received theNobel Peace Prize for his efforts.As we reflect on the fortieth anniversary of UnitedNations peacekeeping  there are certain conclusions to bedrawn. The United Nations has played a crucial rolethroughout the world by dint of its peacekeeping role.Innovation is both necessary and possible within theUnited Nations  and in our time  different as it may be the spirit of internationalism  of commitment tocooperation  calls to us once again.(spoke in English)In a new and changing global environmentinternationalism is ever more important for all nations large or small  weak or powerful. Changing times haveset for us a new broad agenda  which includes focusingon the security needs of individuals — in other words  onsustainable human security. Unfortunately  the new timeshave not sufficiently been reflected by a rededication tothe United Nations as an expression of the spirit ofinternationalism. There remains too often a tendency toact according to old power configurations rather than toseek out collective approaches that address the roots ofconflict and attempt to resolve them through commonaction.12The need for recommitment to the United Nations isclear  and so too is the need for the renewal  restructuringand refocusing of the Organization and its various bodiesand agencies. In implementing this agenda of UnitedNations renewal we will no doubt encounter difficulties anddifferences of opinion. But this should not discourage us.We need the courage to innovate on two fronts  grapplingwith a new and complex world agenda and restructuring theUnited Nations to respond effectively to that agenda.The basic mandate of the United Nations at itsfounding was the prevention of international conflict. Aspeacekeeping has changed over time  one can see theevolution of a security agenda itself  from being a simplebuffer between States to an international responsibility formaintaining order and an involvement in reconstruction.The range of activities in recent times has been impressive from Haiti to Cambodia  from the Golan Heights to ElSalvador  from Bosnia to the peace accords now beingsigned in Guatemala.That range demonstrates that the international responseto threats to security has gone well beyond the initialdefinition  which was limited to dealing with cross-borderaggression. Rather  in a continuum of threats  there is anincreasing focus on conflicts that take place within bordersbut that have severe ripple effects throughout the entireinternational system. These types of conflict are still  inpeacekeeping terms  largely uncharted waters  and of coursethere are differences of view on how best to respond.What is clear is the need for a new tool kit for theUnited Nations to respond to a variety of differentsituations. In this context I am glad to note that most of therecommendations made in the rapid-reaction studysubmitted by Canada last year are now being implemented.Canada will continue to support United Nations efforts toestablish a headquarters that will enhance its ability torespond rapidly and with flexibility. But that is only onetool. Many more are needed  especially in the area ofprevention of disputes and in the arduous and complex taskof peace-building.The failure of conflict prevention in Rwanda  asoutlined in the Rwanda evaluation report  has madeabundantly clear the need to enlarge the concept of peace-building to embrace prevention as well as peacemaking andreconstruction. Preventive action will require much greatercommitment from United Nations Members to interveneearly.In Canada  we are currently focusing our approachto these issues. We have started reworking our owninternational tool kit to improve our ability to initiate andsupport peace-building operations in areas such asmediation  dialogue  human-rights monitoring  judicialreform  police training and demobilization of militaryforces. We look forward to cooperating with other nationsthat are also exploring similar innovative approaches.The search for new tools and the means to utilizethem collectively cannot  however  be a substitute for thereinforcement of existing mechanisms to build peace. Weare about to take a historic step forward on the nuclear-disarmament agenda. Today  the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty was opened for signature. That Treaty isthe result of decades of hope and effort by people aroundthe world. This morning I signed the Treaty on behalf ofCanada. We call upon all States Members of the UnitedNations to do the same.The children of tomorrow should  we hope  neverhave to know what a nuclear test is. If we can succeed inthis goal  and if we can vigorously pursue the goal ofsystematically and progressively reducing nuclearweapons  with the ultimate goal of their elimination  wecan ensure that those children know less and less aboutthe most terrible scourge to face humanity.If the world can focus its energies on ending thetesting of sophisticated and expensive nuclear weapons we believe that there is real hope for setting ourselves thegoal of ending the use of the most simple  cheap and  ona daily basis  most destructive weapon in use today  theanti-personnel landmine.We have all witnessed the suffering  death andhorrifying mutilation caused by mines. Canada  alongwith many other countries and organizations  is engagedin mine-clearance operations. But the simple fact is thatanti-personnel mines are being laid far faster then we canpull them out of the ground. This is not just adisarmament issue. It strikes at the very heart ofdevelopment  and the thousands upon thousands ofvictims affected every year pose a stark challenge tohumanitarian and peacekeeping efforts.Canada will host an international strategy sessionthis autumn  bringing together like-minded Governments international agencies and non-governmental groups toprovide impetus and direction to international effortstowards a global ban on anti-personnel mines. I hope thiswill help to catalyse efforts to build a consensus on a13strong  forward-looking resolution for this fifty-first session.As such  it can provide further impetus to multilateralnegotiations on a full global ban.A third milestone in this area is the ChemicalWeapons Convention  the first international treaty that aimsto introduce a complete  global ban on an entire category ofweapons of mass destruction. It is of the greatestimportance that it be brought into force as soon as possible.(spoke in French)During the cold war  we re-examined and redefinedthe dimensions of international security to embrace theconcept of sustainable human security. The rule of law andgood governance are as important to maintaining globalpeace as disarmament measures. We are also coming torealize that real security cannot be guaranteed by the Statealone  but must involve civil society as well.(spoke in English)These realizations stemmed in part from a growingsense of insecurity at the newly emerging but deadly threatsof what one writer has described as “the underside ofglobalization”  including environmental degradation  crimeand terrorism  and a lack of equity between the peoples ofthe Earth.The recent series of United Nations conferences hasserved both to define the concept of sustainable humansecurity and to bring home the growing challenges to thesecurity of the individual. The road map is clear; we do notneed to study it any further. Now is the time to moveforward in a concerted  comprehensive way.There are already notable examples of what the UnitedNations system has achieved  such as programmes toimprove children’s health and strategies to combat suchenvironmental threats as depletion of the ozone layer.But as important as these advances are  there remainfar too many paper commitments instead of real progresson the ground. Currently we are swamped by a plethora ofagendas  blueprints and plans that run the risk of exhaustingthe ability of donor nations to respond to or have a realimpact on those most in need. Too many bodies areestablished to implement these plans  creating jurisdictionalconfusion and an overlap in implementation. We need torecognize that in the realm of sustainable human security Governments are not alone. The groups and networks thathave emerged around the world representing women indigenous peoples and children  along with business andfinance  are now major players  and we need a system ofgovernance that recognizes this and brings them intopartnership with Governments themselves.One example of a new system is the Arctic Council which was inaugurated in Ottawa last week. Thismultilateral regional body brings together Arctic nationsand indigenous groups to cooperate in the sustainabledevelopment and environmental protection of a uniqueand precious part of the globe. The Council represents anew model of international organization  bringing togetherpeople and States to share their energy and resources ina common cause.The upcoming World Food Summit organized by theFood and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations(FAO) provides another opportunity to combinegovernmental and non-governmental efforts. As a majoragricultural producer  Canada looks forward to workingwith other nations and with non-governmentalorganizations and representatives on solutions to theproblem of food security through approaches totechnology transfer  financing and land reform.As private trade and investment flows intodeveloping countries increasingly outweigh thesignificance of official development assistance  issuessuch as terms of trade and debt take on even greatersignificance. At the same time  new and complex issuesare emerging which existing international structures arenot well placed to address.One major emerging issue is the relationshipbetween trade and labour standards. We are pleased to seethe International Labour Organization (ILO) focus on corelabour standards  including by working towards aninternational convention on the elimination of forced childlabour. There can be no clearer example of an issuewhere cooperation and dialogue with other internationaland regional organizations  particularly between the ILOand the World Trade Organization (WTO) and with non-governmental groups is required in order to producesynergy rather than overlap.Sustainable human security means providing forbasic needs not just in economic ways  but in politicalways as well. Recent conflicts have demonstrated bynegative example that respect for human rights and14democratic principles is fundamental to the prevention ofconflict.Last year  Canada commissioned work on the humanrights components of the United Nations field operations.I am pleased to announce today that we will immediatelybegin compiling a roster of qualified Canadian human rightsexperts available for rapid deployment as part of largerpeace-building operations. We look forward to coordinatingour efforts with those of Norway and others to ensurecoherent  focused support for such United Nations efforts.In 1998 we will celebrate the fiftieth anniversary ofthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This will be anoccasion not only to reaffirm our commitment to itsprinciples  but also to consider further practical steps toimplement them. One step we will take is to promote  aspart of the fiftieth anniversary  the preparations led by theHigh Commissioner for Human Rights  internationaldialogue on means to combat hate propaganda  which is sooften the trigger of human tragedies such as genocide and“ethnic cleansing”.The establishment of international war-crimesTribunals in The Hague for the former Yugoslavia and forRwanda represents a critical element of necessary progressin the field of human rights. They signal our determinationto hold accountable all individuals guilty of committingatrocities  be they officials of the State or extra- or para-State actors. Above all  they signal our determination tobreak the cycle of hatred. It is for these reasons that Canadastrongly urges the prompt establishment of a permanentinternational criminal court as a new instrument in the fightagainst massive human rights violations.There is one aspect of human rights that myGovernment and I have personally decided to make anutmost priority: the rights of children. Let me take thisopportunity to thank the Swedish Government andcommend the organizers of last month’s World Congress onthe Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children. It isCanada’s fervent hope that this Congress will lead to theimplementation of the most effective practical measures  aswell as to the adoption and ratification of legally bindinginternational instruments to combat child slavery and thecommercial sexual exploitation of children. We shouldmove resolutely to conclude negotiation of the DraftOptional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of theChild on the Sale of Children  Child Prostitution and ChildPornography.We will work through our own development fundswith all countries interested in similar goals.The concept of sustainable democracy requires beyond a commitment to respect for basic human rights also a commitment to democratic development. In the lastdecade we have seen the United Nations involved in thepromotion of democracy from Cambodia to South Africato Haiti. Other multilateral organizations are also playingan important role  such as the Organization for Securityand Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in the recent electionsin Bosnia. Recent conflicts have demonstrated theimportance of stable democratic structures in promotingsustainable human security. They have also highlightedthe need to distinguish between legitimate aspirations anddangerous tendencies towards fragmentation. Attempts tostructure political participation around culturally orethnically “pure” mini-States must be resisted by theinternational community.(spoke in French)Haiti has been a critical test for the United Nations.The promotion of democratization has been an integralpart of security. Concerted international effort is neededto support democracy  not merely for the sake of oneleader or one election  but as part of the ongoing processof laying the foundations of democratic institutions. Wemust recognize this and must make the commitmentsneeded to ensure that the United Nations can workeffectively for peace and stability in Haiti.(spoke in English)Nigeria  Burundi and Burma are among the mostrecent challenges to our collective ability to supportdemocratic aspirations. Canada remains firmly committedto the restoration of democracy in these countries  and toworking in these countries and with our partners bilaterally  multilaterally and within the Commonwealthand francophonie to this end.The explosion of information technologies presentsgreat dangers but also great opportunities for humansecurity. Extremist groups can spread their message ofhate and intolerance more easily  and we have only tolook to Bosnia and Rwanda to see the tragic effects thiscan have. Yet at the same time  these technologies haveplaced powerful tools for the strengthening of civilsociety in the hands of millions of individual citizens andgroups.15The development of information technologies raisesmany other questions  including issues of access and ofcountering abuses such as the transmission of childpornography or terrorism. The Economic and SocialCouncil has mandated a study of these issues. In Canadawe believe we have solid knowledge and expertise in thesearea in terms of technology and jurisprudence and we willmake major contributions to finding solutions.I have outlined some of the major issues that requireconceptual innovation on the part of the United Nations.The counterpart to conceptual innovation is innovation inrenewing existing United Nations structures and developingnew ones. We should not hesitate to eliminate thoseprogrammes or bodies that no longer serve any usefulpurpose  to reorient those whose mission so requires  andto consolidate and eliminate duplication. Nor should wehesitate to create new instruments  within existingresources  to deal with the challenge of the day. Reform ismore than just cost-cutting  though that aspect must not beignored.Our first priority is the ongoing financial crisis theUnited Nations faces. We have seen some encouragingprogress in the establishment and early results of theEfficiency Board.Perhaps more importantly  there is a growingawareness of the need for financial and administrativerestructuring. But much remains to be done. I cannotsimply content myself here with calling yet again for allMembers to pay their dues unconditionally — in full andon time. I have to ask why it is that over half the MemberStates are failing to meet this standard  and some are failingto pay at all. Pressures on government budgets is noexcuse; Canada has in recent years undertaken some of themost severe expenditure cuts of any developed country. Yetwe have maintained our commitment to pay our dues in fulland on time  because we believe that the United Nationsresponds to key international priorities.Perhaps some Members are withholding dues as aform of blackmail  hoping to pressure the United Nationsinto reforms through fiscal starvation. This is both wrong-headed and short-sighted. An organization in crisis will nothave the energy required to tackle genuine reform. What isneeded here is political will  both in paying dues and inmoving forward in the difficult task of reviewing the scaleof assessments to better reflect the ability to pay. Canadahopes that others will join us in demonstrating that willduring the current session of the Assembly.Another priority is to strengthen the effectiveness ofthe Security Council by giving it greater accountability representativeness  transparency and responsibility.Canada attaches particular importance to the need toensure meaningful participation in decision-making bythose Members whose nationals — military or civilian —are in the crossfire of the conflicts that the Council isdebating.The Council needs to address two issues: its role andits composition. On the former  if the Council is to cometo terms with the more complex nature of internationalpeace and security  it must be prepared to assume agreater role in conflict prevention. This will requirecooperation among the Security Council  the Secretary-General and other Governments and non-governmentalactors in identifying and addressing emergency crises.On the latter issue  the Council can addresscriticisms of it as a closed body whose membership doesnot fully reflect changes in the world since 1945 byincreasing the number of seats. The distribution of thoseseats should take into account in the first instance thecontribution of Members to the broader purposes of theUnited Nations Charter  and also the need for equitablegeographic representation. Membership has its privileges but more importantly  it must bring with it a specialresponsibility and commitment to the principles of theUnited Nations Charter and to sustainable human security.(spoke in French)Equally important is the revitalization of the GeneralAssembly. The United Nations General Assembly is theone body that brings together all nations of the world intheir full diversity. It represents on a global scale both theessence and the challenge of democracy. The GeneralAssembly must achieve consensus and take decisions onthe new human security agenda. It must promotesustainable human security  a concept that combines theneed to husband natural resources  to generate growth andto ensure peace and security.(spoke in English)I have outlined today some of the steps that Canadahas taken to advance thinking  to improve existingpractices and to develop new ones. And I know that otherMember States have been working towards the very sameend. We now have many options to consider and discuss.16But plans  proposals and studies are not enough. Asthe poet Yeats said  “In dreams begins responsibility.” It iseasy to dream; it is much harder to act. We have a renewedvision of multilateralism  and a renewed mandate not justfor the prevention of conflict  but for the nurturing ofpeace. We have started work on making that vision areality. We all recognize how daunting this task is as weembark upon it; but we must persist  for the task is as vitalas it is difficult.We in 1996 must show ourselves capable of restoringthe spirit of 1956 when  in the deepest freeze of the cold-war climate  the United Nations gave birth to peacekeepingand changed international relations forever. We need to findwithin ourselves the ability and the will to innovate and thepersistence to implement our innovations. It is in theinterest of each one of us  as much as it is in the interestsof all of us  to do so."
"31",1270,"CHL",51,1996,"First of all  Sir  I wish to express our pleasure at seeing theMinister for Foreign Affairs of Honduras — a country withwhich we have long-standing and well-established ties offriendship and with which we are currently working in theSecurity Council — preside over this meeting. I would alsolike through you to convey my Government'scongratulations to Ambassador Razali Ismail on his electionto the presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-firstsession.This is a transitional period for the United Nations andis therefore not devoid of complexities and uncertainty. Yetwe still have confidence in the ability of Member Statesand in the privileged forum provided by this Organizationto develop new policies and management structures to dealwith the gamut of emerging international problems.As this session of the General Assembly begins  weonce again renew our commitment to the principles andpurposes of the Charter  the living instrument essential tothe future work of this Organization. The United Nations isan Organization which  through its nature  principles andobjectives  transcends any individual or national interests torepresent  instead  the interests of all.Not even those who criticize the United Nations in thehopes that they can weaken it or shrink its role have everbeen able to propose any better way for us to cometogether to address the major problems of an increasinglyinterdependent world. That is why we are convinced that far from becoming weaker  this Organization will be calledupon to play an increasingly important role in this new eraof globalization  in which cooperation is the only possibleoption for a true international order.International peace and security  free trade  socialdevelopment based on growth with equity  environmentalprotection  democracy and human rights are the basiccomponents of the future work of our multilateral system.These are the areas of action of our Organization to whichChile attaches the highest priority and in which we will try within our means to make our greatest contribution.It has often been said that the end of the super-Powerconfrontation that characterized the first 50 years of the lifeof this Organization makes it easier than ever to shape theconditions for peace and stability. And yet  the challengesof bipolar confrontation have been replaced by new onesposed by the emergence of numerous local conflicts.These are often characterized by mass violations ofhuman rights  uncontrolled population flows andhumanitarian emergencies that threaten the security ofindividuals and States and eventually may affect theinternational system as a whole.Our participation in the work of the Security Councilis aimed at contributing our fair share to the maintenanceof international peace and security. We encouragepreventive diplomacy  consensus solutions  theimplementation of measures to contain conflicts  thepromotion of peaceful solutions through peace-keepingoperations  conciliation  good offices and  in particular the protection of affected populations and victims.At the same time  it is indisputable that peace andsecurity are not simply the absence of tensions andconflict between States. Harmony between people withinthe same border has now become a fundamental factor ininternational peace and security. Chile has suggested thatthe Security Council should act in cases where there is areal or potential risk of mass and systematic violations towhich the international community has reacted stronglyand when earlier mechanisms or bodies trying to resolvethe problem have been exhausted.Recent measures adopted by the Council  such asresolution 688 (1991) on protecting the Kurdish minority 770 (1992) on providing assistance to victims of theconflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina  resolution 986 (1995)on alleviating the burden of sanctions on the civilian Iraqipopulation  are a few examples of a broader and moreprogressive interpretation of what constitutes a threat topeace and establish valuable precedents for helping theSecurity Council to deal with these kinds of conflict.These criteria also guided us in our activeparticipation on the question of Burundi  which led to theadoption of resolution 1072 (1996) establishingprocedures for the various parties to the conflict to beable to agree on a political path to a peaceful resolutionof their differences. We must continue to pay closeattention to developments in this situation. Theinternational community  the United Nations and theSecurity Council cannot risk another tragedy like that ofRwanda and must exhaust all possible means of avertingsuch a tragedy.Today we would also like to express our greatconcern at the serious crisis that has arisen in the last few6General Assembly 11th plenary meetingFifty-first session 26 September 1996hours affecting the peace process in the Middle East  aprocess we have supported from the outset. We urge theparties to the conflict not to waste what has been built upin the last few years and to resume dialogue within thecontext of respect for agreements reached and for thebeliefs of the peoples involved.Establishing stability requires clear commitment todisarmament and arms control and limitation. My countryhas played an active role in this area  as shown in therecent ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention membership in the Conference on Disarmament  whichChile had long aspired to  ratification of the Treaty on theNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and ourunstinting support for nuclear-weapon-free zones.Last Tuesday  24 September 1996  I had the honour tosign on behalf of my country the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. Just one year ago  this Assembly wasdiscussing the nuclear-weapon tests still being conducted inthe South Pacific and Asia. Today we are meeting to signa Treaty that eliminates those tests once and for all and isthe combined effort of almost all the countries in thisAssembly  including all the present nuclear-weapon States.When the United Nations is criticized for its allegedinefficiency I think we should also vaunt our successes.These initiatives  along with progress in the area ofconventional weapons and weapons of mass destruction help to create the right conditions for peace and securityand enable the international community to concentrate itsefforts and material resources on the development ofnations and environmental protection.Peacekeeping operations are one of the most importantinstruments of this system. Peacekeeping forces have tostrive for results in the framework of clear and well-definedand legitimate mandates. Chile has participated inpeacekeeping operations in India  Pakistan  the Middle East Cambodia and Kuwait  and we are currently taking part inthe activities of the United Nations Special Commission(UNSCOM) in Iraq.However  there is no doubt that this mechanism needsto be tailored to dealing with current politicalcircumstances. To this end  Chile is active in deliberationson how to improve planning and rapid-reaction capacity todeal with incipient conflicts. In all these aspects  amultilateral approach  action that enjoys the consent of theparties and financing through the Organization all help toensure success in our work. We hope to increasesignificantly our contribution to operations such as theones I have just described.A broad understanding of the maintenance ofinternational peace and security requires decisive actionin the area of social development  democracy and thepromotion of human rights. The world order of the nextcentury will need broader basic freedoms. The globalsociety of the next century is appearing as an open heterogenous one  rich in material potential and newdevelopments. What is needed now is to create conditionsto enable people and States to make the most of this newsetting  with increased access to the goods that are thefruit of rapid technological development.In this respect  the six recent world conferences andsummits on the environment and development  humanrights  population and development  women  socialdevelopment and  most recently  human settlements  haveall been geared towards promoting protection of theindividual and gradually creating a framework for socialrights.One tangible result of these meetings  in the socialarea  was the emergence of national coordinating bodiesto implement the agreements signed. But these efforts arenot enough  given the tragic reality of most of the lessdeveloped peoples  which means that the United Nationssystem must play an ever stronger role in the internationalsocial area. We must speed up the process ofimplementation within the context of the United Nationsand of the agreements that emerged from Rio de Janeiro Vienna  Cairo  Copenhagen  Beijing and Istanbul.The first steps have now been taken within thevarious bodies of the system  particularly in the Economicand Social Council and its functional commissions. It isencouraging that the Economic and Social Council bodiesdealing with sustainable development  women  socialdevelopment and population have adopted multi-yearagendas as a follow-up to the conferences.Similarly  the agreements reached at the WorldSummit for Social Development include the decision tohold a special session of this Assembly in the year 2000to assess the implementation of the agreements.In this connection  Chile wishes to propose theestablishment of a working group of this Assembly that with that special session as its basis  can provide follow-up to the six conferences  taking into account the Agendafor Development  so that in the year 2000 the General7General Assembly 11th plenary meetingFifty-first session 26 September 1996Assembly can take up a very wide-ranging and coordinatedassessment of the implementation of the commitments ofthe 1990s and make the necessary recommendations forfuture work.In recent years Latin America has taken major stepsforward with regard to free trade. This Assembly hasalready heard about progress in the Southern ConeCommon Market (MERCOSUR)  Chile's recent accessionto that agreement and MERCOSUR’s decision to negotiatesimilar agreements with the Andean Group and Mexico.Taken alongside the progress made by other subregionalgroups  such as the Central America Common Market(CACM) and the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)  theseachievements all go to show the new impetus in LatinAmerica for integration based on economic ideas that differfrom those of the past but that remain true to the politicalwill for unity that has always existed among our peoples.However  none of these regional developments inwhich Chile has been very active constitutes an alternativeto multilateralism. Chile continues to believe that amultilateral system to establish standards and practices toensure free trade throughout the world  with clearinstitutional machinery for negotiations and disputesettlement  is the best option for the global economy andfor each of our countries.For this reason we have always insisted that ournegotiations fit into the multilateral framework of the WorldTrade Organization (WTO). Latin America wants to beintegrated so that it can become more of a part of theglobal economy  not cut off from it. Our bilateral andregional agreements are based on open regionalism. Thebest proof that this is being put into practice is that duringthis period of increased integration  external tariffs in thecountries of our region have also fallen considerably compared with those of the rest of the world.One of the most promising developments of recentyears has been the strengthening of the multilateral tradesystem through the establishment of the WTO. Theexistence of a standing multilateral forum means that moreenergy can be devoted to implementing the agreementsreached and provides an institutional framework forcontinuous progress in negotiations and for opening upworld trade.In this connection  Chile attaches great importance tothe follow-up meeting to the Uruguay Round  to be held inSingapore in December 1996. This  the first biannualmeeting in the framework of the WTO  will be crucial indetermining how effective the new mechanism is.In the last few years many regions and countries inthe world have made major progress towards broadeningand consolidating democracy and respect for humanrights. Latin America in particular has been experiencinga rapid movement towards democracy that isunprecedented in its history. This is accompanied by aconsiderable increase in political dialogue and regionalcoordination  evident mainly in the Rio Group  which hasbeen active and fruitful for 10 years now.Far from making us complacent  this emphasizes ourconcern that in many parts of the world there are stillsituations of massive violation of human rights andfundamental freedoms. Sometimes these situations relateto the peace and security problems we mentioned earlier.As democracies develop  the support given them bythe people depends more and more on their ability toensure stable  efficient and transparent governments. Thelegitimacy of democratic governments is closely relatedto their accountability  but in many countries there is stillcorruption  inefficiency and insensitivity to social needs.This erodes the legitimacy of democracy and highlightsits fragility.The Government of our President  Eduardo Frei  hasmade democratic governance the main subject of the sixthsummit of Ibero-American Heads of State andGovernment  to be held in Chile in November 1996. Tothis end  we have enjoyed the valuable cooperation of theUnited Nations  through the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme (UNDP) and the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). We hopethat our Organization's work in this area will spread toother regions in coming years.One of the most dramatic changes for mankind inthe last few decades has been our awareness that natureis fragile in the hands of man. There is a vulnerability innature we had not suspected until we saw the damagedone  much of it irreparable. And so there is a newdimension to human responsibility to nature. Thepossibility of altering life on our planet for the worsemeans that our unbounded scientific and technologicalpower must be accompanied by a new principle: and thatis the idea of shared responsibility.The work facing us is hard  but the path was alreadylaid out in 1992 at the Conference on Environment and8General Assembly 11th plenary meetingFifty-first session 26 September 1996Development. In Rio de Janeiro there was agreement onfundamental aspects. On the basis of the consensus  and thecommitments reached there  my country is prepared toproceed. Since that Earth Summit  Chile has furtherdeveloped its environmental legislation. We have embracedthe principles of the Rio Declaration that we considerfundamental  such as preventing environmental pollution cooperation and the primary responsibility of the polluter.The State has accepted its obligation to adopt the mostsuitable instruments for preventive environmentalmanagement. But we also believe that society must begiven a leading role in protecting the environment  and tothis end various social actors must be more committed andmore responsible.My Government thinks it is also important to stressthe political commitment of the world community to thisissue that is by nature international and in many respectsglobal. Hence  we attach great importance to thefunctioning of the bodies set up and to the monitoring ofthe agreements reached at the Earth Summit.Developments in the international arena  the increasingdiversity of issues to be taken up and the number of actorsinvolved in the United Nations — all of this revitalizing thereform process of our Organization essential in order toadapt it to emerging realities and challenges. Integrated andmultidisciplinary focus must be given preference in dealingwith these problems. This constitutes the conceptualframework of the Organization and a basis for the urgentlyneeded process of reform. This requires a very thoroughanalysis of the content of our multilateral work  of theOrganization's agenda  of the functioning ofintergovernmental bodies  of our human and financialresources and of the structure of the Secretariat. By doingall that  we can carry out reforms that are more thanrhetoric  that will enable us to take up the challenges of thenext century with policies and organizations adapted to thenew reality.Chile wishes to reiterate its appreciation for the workbeing done by the Secretary-General in this area. Indifficult budgetary circumstances and facing a very difficultpolitical situation  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali has decisivelybegun  within his purview  the process of reforming theOrganization.We welcome all initiatives that can enhance theefficiency of our Organization  reduce its bureaucraticexcesses or alleviate its financial problems. But we believethat United Nations reform should not be mistakenlyidentified with one single issue of administration orbudgetary efficiency. There is quite a contradictionbetween saying that we need an Organization adapted tothe new challenges and focused on the next century  andthen reducing the practical debate simply to cost-cuttingand better control of resources. We have to enhanceadministrative efficiency  but we must also appreciatesubstantive effectiveness. Our objective should be tostrengthen the Organization as well as to streamline it.Before concluding  I cannot fail to mention aquestion of reform on this year's agenda that is moreurgent than it was in previous years. The plethora ofdecisions taken by the Security Council has resulted in agrowing desire on the part of the other Members of theUnited Nations to be more involved in Council decisions so as to strengthen its legitimacy and the political supportfor its actions.Improving the working methods of the SecurityCouncil has opened up additional ways of enhancing itscredibility. There has been progress  but much remains tobe done  particularly in connection with consultations withcountries that contribute troops to peacekeepingoperations  consultations with countries neighbouring aconflict area that might be affected  and third States thatare negatively affected by the application of sanctions.A second determining factor of legitimacy andpolitical support for Council decisions relates to itsmembership. In this connection  Chile believes it essentialto resolve once and for all the problems of increasing themembership of the Security Council  which haveconcerned the Assembly since 1992. We think there is abroad base of agreement for allowing Germany and Japanto become permanent members of the Council  and at thesame time for giving developing countries one permanentseat per region  the occupants of which would be electedat the regional level.Also  in order to meet the need for representativity given the great increase in membership of the UnitedNations in the last decade  the number of non-permanentseats should be increased from 10 to 15  with appropriateequitable geographical distribution. A membership oftwenty-five members would not undermine theeffectiveness of the Security Council but would enhancethe representativity of its actions.However  we wish to emphasize that Chile is willingto act with maximum flexibility here. This means we arewilling to consider other proposals by other MemberStates that also seek to combine the two fundamentalelements that should guide our decision: recognition of thenew international realities and a legitimate desire forrepresentativity in the principal bodies of our system.We wished to touch upon those issues that  in Chile’sview  will be the Organization’s main tasks in the years tocome  with a view to establishing the framework of stabilityand legitimacy necessary to achieve United Nationsobjectives. Chile commits its firm support to this difficultunderstanding  which will be attainable with the will andparticipation of all members of the international community."
"32",1316,"CHN",51,1996,"﻿Please allow me first of all to offer my sincerecongratulations to Ambassador Razali Ismail on his electionto the presidency of the General Assembly at its currentsession. I am convinced that with his outstanding abilityand rich experience he will fulfil this lofty mission withdistinction. I would also like to express my thanks toMr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral for the important contributionhe made during his presidency of the last session.The 1990s are a period of momentous transition during which international relations are undergoing the mostfar-reaching changes since the Second World War. Thecollapse and disappearance of the bipolar structure hasrekindled hope that the world will become a community ofcountries with equal rights for all  rather than onedominated by a single big Power. Multipolarity is gainingmomentum in a global as well as a regional context. MajorPowers are readjusting their relationships. On the otherhand  the multitude of developing countries have becomeincreasingly aware of the need to bolster their strengththrough concerted efforts. The Non-Aligned Movementcontinues to uphold the ideals and principles ofindependence  independent decision-making andnon-affiliation with blocs  and is vigorously pushing fora new just and democratic international order of peaceand equality. Regional economic organizations  which aredisplaying great vitality  are expanding their role inpromoting regional cooperation and development in theirrespective areas.Asia’s upsurge is having a significant impact on theworld’s political and economic configurations. The worldis deeply impressed with the vigorous economicdevelopment of Asia  East Asia in particular. Theconvening of the first Asia-Europe meeting highlightedthe changes now being seen and marked an importantnew beginning for an equal  cooperative relationshipbetween Asia and Europe. As the world moves towardsmultipolarity  the forces for peace are bolstered. The callfor dialogue and cooperation  as against confrontation andconflict  has become louder.In the Asia-Pacific region  efforts to maintain peaceand stability and promote common development throughdialogue  consultation and cooperation have yieldedpositive results. An agreement on confidence-building inthe military field along border areas has been concludedbetween China on the one hand  and the RussianFederation  Kazakstan  Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan on theother; this agreement governs a boundary over 3 000kilometres in length. The Association of South-East AsianNations (ASEAN) Regional Forum has succeeded inbringing Asia-Pacific countries together to considersecurity issues facing the region. The Asia-PacificEconomic Cooperation Council (APEC) has become auseful mechanism for promoting trade and investmentliberalization as well as economic and technologicalcooperation in the region.The past year has seen peace returning to a numberof war-torn countries and regions. We are pleased to notethat the peace accord reached between the belligerents inBosnia and Herzegovina is being implemented  and thatYugoslavia and Croatia have normalized their relations.It is hoped that peace will soon be fully restored to theregion of the former Yugoslavia in order to put an end tothe prolonged conflict in that part of Europe.The impact on Africa of the drastic changes in thepost-cold war international situation is waning. Africa isentering a new historical era in which it is striving forpeace  stability and development. Many burning issues inAfrica have already been or are in the process of beingsettled gradually. At the same time  however  some14countries and regions are still plagued by the scourge ofwar. We hope that the international community willcontinue to give attention and attach importance to Africanissues so as to help bring lasting peace and development tothe whole African continent at an early date.But the path towards peace is tortuous. After somemajor gains in preceding years  the Middle East peaceprocess has hit snags again. China is concerned at thisdevelopment. We hope that all the parties concerned willstrive for an early comprehensive and just settlement of thisissue by strictly observing the agreements already reachedand resuming negotiations and dialogue on the basis of therelevant United Nations resolutions.Peace should have prevailed in the post-cold-warworld  in which equal members of the internationalcommunity should respect each other’s sovereignty andterritorial integrity  refrain from invading each other orinterfering in each other’s internal affairs  and live inharmony with each other  in a spirit of seeking commonground and putting aside differences. However  the realityis that the world today is far from tranquil because thecold-war mentality dies hard and hegemonism hasrepeatedly raised its ugly head. Interference in othercountries’ internal affairs under various pretexts  andindulgence in sanctions-wielding or even the use of forceare trampling on the purposes and principles of the Charterof the United Nations and all accepted norms ofinternational relations  thereby threatening and underminingworld peace and stability. Recent controversies ininternational forums  generated by the issue of sanctions signify that in the context of a growing trend towardsmultipolarity  hegemonism and power politics will becomeincreasingly untenable.The vigorous expansion of international trade andinvestment and the rapid advance of science and technologyhave led to closer economic ties between countries andregions  thus accelerating the process of economicglobalization. This presents a rare opportunity to bothdeveloped and developing countries. By riding the tide ofglobalization and relying on their own unremitting efforts some developing countries have achieved sustained andrapid economic growth  thereby giving a great impetus toworld economic growth. These and other changes on theworld scene have widened the prospects of internationalcooperation.Regrettably  however  a counter-current of tradeprotectionism has recently arisen in the ranks of developedcountries  designed to curtail the development of developingcountries and exclude them from the decision-makingprocess on major world economic issues. Any actprejudicial to developing countries will in the finalanalysis undermine the interests of developed countries.International economic exchanges and cooperation shouldbe built on the basis of mutual complementarity. Facingthe tide of economic globalization  neither developed nordeveloping countries should resort to trade protectionism.Rather  both should make the necessary readjustments andreforms in the light of their own national conditions inorder to promote their welfare and keep out of harm’sway. Only by enhancing international exchanges andcooperation on the basis of equality and mutual benefitcan we jointly cope with new problems arising in thecourse of world economic advances and achieve sustainedcommon development and prosperity.No one should overlook the unevenness of worlddevelopment and the ever widening gap betweendeveloped and developing countries. Caught in the web ofrelentless international competition  the least-developedcountries are in distress  and the risk of marginalizationis looming large. To make matters worse  the amount ofofficial development assistance from richer countries isshrinking every year  with more stringent conditionsattached. The coffers of the United Nations CapitalDevelopment Fund are drying up  and future prospects aregrim indeed. The international community  and especiallythe developed countries  are duty-bound to take effectivemeasures to reverse this dire situation. The promotion ofeconomic development and the prosperity of all countries and the elimination of poverty should always be at the topof the United Nations agenda.Strengthening international cooperation in the fieldof the environment and development is a vital link inglobal efforts to achieve sustainable development.Four years after the United Nations Conference onEnvironment and Development  the public has becomeincreasingly aware of the importance of environmentalprotection. Sustainable development has become a majorobjective in the socio-economic development strategies ofall countries. However  international cooperation in thisdomain is disappointingly lagging. Developed countrieshave failed to live up to their pledges under Agenda 21 interms of funding and technology transfer  yet theydemand that developing countries accept obligationsexceeding their capability at their present level ofdevelopment. It is hoped that next year’s special sessionon environment and development will be able to resolvethese issues.15Poverty  unemployment  the problem of refugees crime  over-population  environmental deterioration  drugabuse and terrorism — these scourges remain formidableand impede global stability and development. In the face ofthese challenges  all countries should not only carry outsocial development policies commensurate with their ownnational conditions  but should also actively cooperate withone another in line with the principles of mutual respect equality and mutual benefit. The United Nations needs toenhance its social programmes focusing on developingcountries.The international community at large should press forthe implementation of the follow-up actions of the CairoInternational Conference on Population and Development the Copenhagen World Summit for Social Development andthe Beijing Fourth World Conference on Women in favourof universal social development.Our Organization has gone through vicissitudes in thecourse of half a century. Enormous changes have takenplace on the world scene. It is imperative for the UnitedNations to carry out appropriate rational reforms so that itcan better perform the noble mission of the times and ushera better world into the twenty-first century.All reforms must be conducive to realizing thepurposes and principles of the Charter and to improving theefficiency of the United Nations. They must also contributeto a more positive and effective United Nations role inpromoting world peace and common development. Theymust conform to the principle of the sovereign equality ofall States  and reflect the aspirations of the developingcountries  which comprise more than two-thirds of themembership. Democratic consultations should be practicedthroughout this process. We are confident that we will beable to achieve a broad consensus as long as all of usengage in patient deliberations in the spirit of openness andfair play  and with a readiness to consider all legitimateconcerns.The United Nations continues to be plagued by aserious financial crisis. The Organization cannot functionnormally without firm and reliable fiscal resources. We callon the major countries whose financial contributions to theOrganization are in arrears to fulfil the financial obligationsset forth in the Charter by unconditionally paying up in fullwithout further delay.Major progress has been made in the field of armscontrol and disarmament since the last session of theGeneral Assembly. The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-BanTreaty resulting from two and a half years of negotiationshas finally been adopted by the General Assembly.Chinaactively participated in the Treaty negotiations anddisplayed maximum flexibility  thereby contributingsignificantly to the final conclusion of the Treaty. Wehave always stood for the complete prohibition andthorough destruction of nuclear weapons. In our view  thecomprehensive test-ban Treaty is only a first step in theentire process of comprehensive nuclear disarmament.There are still large stockpiles of nuclear arms in theworld. Some nuclear Powers still refuse to undertake notto be the first to use such weapons. We still have a longway to go  and must continue to work strenuously inorder to achieve the ultimate goal of the total eliminationof nuclear weapons.In order to expedite nuclear disarmament and freeourselves from the danger of nuclear war forever  I wishto reiterate the following calls on behalf of the ChineseGovernment: first  the major nuclear Powers shouldrenounce their policy of nuclear deterrence; thosepossessing huge nuclear arsenals should continue to cutback their stockpiles drastically.Secondly  all nuclear States should assume theobligation not to be the first to use nuclear weapons atany time or under any circumstances; they shouldunconditionally renounce the use or threat of use of suchweapons against non-nuclear States or nuclear-free zones;and they should conclude international instruments to thateffect without delay.Thirdly  those States which have deployed nuclearweapons overseas should withdraw them completely; allnuclear States should pledge support for moves to set upnuclear-free zones; they should respect the status of suchzones and assume corresponding obligations.Fourthly  all States should refrain from developingor deploying weapons systems in outer space and missiledefence systems that undermine strategic security andstability.Fifthly  all States should negotiate with a view toconcluding an international convention on the completeprohibition and total destruction of nuclear weapons.Since mankind was able to produce nuclear weaponsin the twentieth century  it is fully capable of abolishingthem in the twenty-first century. The Chinese Governmentand people are ready to join hands with all Governments16and peoples of the world to strive for the realization of thislofty goal.My country continues to press forward along the roadof reform  opening up and modernization. Our economymaintains a healthy momentum. The macroeconomicenvironment continues to improve. We anticipate a growthrate of around 10 per cent this year. Inflation will be keptbelow 10 per cent. Despite severe natural disasters in someparts of the country  we have still managed to gather abumper harvest of summer crops this year. Grain output forthe entire year is expected to top the previous year’sfigures. The Ninth Five-Year Plan for National Economicand Social Development and the Outline of the Long-RangeObjectives to the Year 2010 were inaugurated this year.They depict a promising future for China’s modernizationdrive at the turn of the century. By the year 2000  when ourpopulation will have had a net increase of 300 million  weexpect to quadruple our 1980 per capita gross nationalproduct. And by the year 2010 our gross national productis anticipated to be twice that of the year 2000. Then wewill have put in place a viable socialist market economy.Seventeen years of reform and opening up havebrought about a fourfold increase in our gross nationalproduct. Our overall national strength will grow further inanother 15 years. Yet China will still be a developingcountry with relatively low ranking in terms of indicatorssuch as per capita gross national product. China’sdevelopment will only help to bolster the elements makingfor peace. We pose no threat to anyone anywhere  but willonly help to strengthen the cause of world peace  stabilityand development. On the other hand  if China fails toachieve economic development and its population of 1.2billion is mired in poverty  that would indeed be ominousfor world peace and stability.China will resume the exercise of sovereignty overHong Kong as from 1 July 1997. This will be a milestonein the great cause of our national reunification. It is also agood example of how countries can peacefully resolveissues left over by history. Preparations are under way toput into effect our resumption of the exercise of sovereigntyover Hong Kong. We are fully capable of ensuring asmooth transfer of government and transition in HongKong. After Hong Kong’s return to the embrace of themotherland  we will put into effect the policy of “onecountry  two systems”. As a Special Administrative Regionof the People’s Republic of China  and in conformity withthe Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special AdministrativeRegion  Hong Kong will be administered by the HongKong people. It will enjoy a high degree of autonomy. Theexisting social and economic system and way of life willremain unchanged  and the laws currently in force inHong Kong will be basically maintained. Hong Kong willretain its status as an international trade  financial andshipping centre  free port and separate customs territory.Its long-term stability and prosperity will be guaranteed.Foreign economic interests in Hong Kong will beaccommodated.Twenty-five years ago  at its twenty-sixth session the General Assembly adopted the historic resolution2758 (XXVI)  solemnly declaring the restoration to thePeople’s Republic of China all its lawful rights in theUnited Nations. That resolution thoroughly settled thequestion of China’s representation in the United Nation inall aspects — political  legal and procedural.There is but one China in the world and Taiwan isan inalienable part of its sacred territory. “Peacefulreunification and one country with two systems” — thisis our unswerving guideline for the settlement of theTaiwan question. This question involves a cardinalprinciple of China’s sovereignty and territorial integrityand the great task of reunification. It is a purely internalaffair of China which will brook no outside interference.The Chinese Government and people are determined tocarry through the struggle against all attempts to splittheir territory or create an independent Taiwan. No forceon Earth can hold back China’s great cause ofreunification.The world is on the march at top speed. Newcontradictions and problems are constantly arising. Theprofound changes in the international scene have broughtforth rare opportunities as well as serious challenges. Letus seize the opportunities  meet the challenges and pushforward the cause of peace and development. Such is theglorious mission which our times have bestowed on us.The Chinese Government and people are ready to joinwith all other Governments and peoples in this endeavour."
"33",1350,"CIV",51,1996,"﻿My delegation and I are pleased  Sir  to see youpresiding over the fifty-first session of the GeneralAssembly. Your great experience of multilateraldiplomacy  along with the apt initiatives which your greatcountry  Malaysia  and you yourself have taken in manyfocal areas of international relations make you the rightperson to guide us and to ensure the success of thisimportant session.I extend my sincere congratulations to yourpredecessor  Ambassador Diogo Freitas do Amaral  forthe outstanding work he did in heading the GeneralAssembly at a difficult time  marked by a financial crisisunprecedented in the history of our Organization. Thanksto his abilities and diplomacy  he helped to preserve thefounding roles of this institution  namely the maintenanceof peace and of economic and social development  and toguide it towards new areas. We are particularly gratefulto him for his excellent work at the last session  whichmarked the fiftieth anniversary of our Organization.The delegation of Côte d’Ivoire would also like tothank the Secretary-General for the active anddetermined part that he has always played in heading theSecretariat  particularly in the areas of peacekeeping andeconomic and social development. Accordingly  the Côted’Ivoire endorses the Declaration of African Heads ofState or Government  who  at the thirty-second Summit ofthe Organization of African Unity  held at Yaoundé reaffirmed Africa’s right to a second term and4recommended the candidature of Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali.Nearly a year ago  on 22 October 1995  a SpecialCommemorative Meeting of the General Assembly tookplace  involving 129 Heads of State or Government whohad come here solemnly to reconfirm their belief in theideals of the Charter of the United Nations  namely peace development  international cooperation  equality and justice and also to demonstrate their commitment to the reform andmodernization of our Organization so that it can take up thechallenges of the future. In the Declaration on the Occasionof the Fiftieth Anniversary of the United Nations  adoptedon 24 October last  we committed ourselves to assuring thatwe:“will give to the twenty-first century a United Nationsequipped  financed and structured to serve effectivelythe peoples in whose name it was established.”(resolution 50/6)Encouraged by Ambassador Diogo Freitas do Amaralover the past year  the General Assembly and theSecretariat have advanced on the path of reform for theUnited Nations and clarification of its objectives andmissions. The open-ended working groups of the GeneralAssembly responsible for examining “An Agenda forPeace”  the Agenda for Development  Security Councilreform  the financial situation of the United Nations  andthe strengthening of the United Nations system  havesufficiently progressed in their considerations to allow thegreatest hopes as to the restructuring of our Organization its revitalization with an eye to greater effectivenessadapted to contemporary needs and challenges.I would add that after a decade of study and reflectionon United Nations reform  it is now imperative to proceedwith such reform so that we can focus on what constitutesthe raison d’être of our Organization: its essential missions namely  the maintenance of peace and security  thepromotion of economic and social development  thestruggle against poverty  humanitarian assistance  theprotection of human rights and democracy  the protectionof the environment  dialogue among cultures and respect fordiversity.Concomitant with this progress by Member Statetowards reform  there has been an equally commendableeffort by the Secretariat to correct the Organization’sdisfunctions  particularly those relating to fragmentationwithin the United Nations system and the inadequacy ofcertain coordinating mechanisms  as well as  in some cases the absence of a rational division of labour  which has ledto overlapping and duplication.I would particularly like to mention  among otherthings  the progress that has been made towards therestructuring and revitalization of the United Nations inthe economic  social and related fields pursuant toresolution 50/227. On the basis of that resolution  theEconomic and Social Council will carry out its workwithin a rationalized framework that should enable it toattain the objectives assigned to it under the Charter. Itsworking methods will also be adapted to the necessity ofbetter time management and greater budgetary savings operating on the basis of a rational reduction in the manyoutputs of this body  with a view to assuring greatereffectiveness. Thanks to this resolution  we should be ableslowly to move away from the heavy and spendthriftbureaucracy associated with our Organization.It is in this spirit that  in anticipation  the UnitedNations Development Programme (UNDP) was able toreform its working methods  redeploy its people in thefield and develop its activities thanks to a fruitfulpartnership within and beyond the United Nations system notably with representatives of civil society. This trulyremarkable transformation of UNDP over the past twoyears has enabled it to regain a central role in operationalactivities for development on all continents  particularlyin Africa  where it is steering the United Nations System-wide Special Initiative for Africa.Reform is an act of the will that plays itself out overtime. It must be carried out from the inside and under theimpetus of Member States. In this regard  we maywelcome the evaluation of the Efficiency Board chairedby Under-Secretary-General Joseph Connor  whose workis highly encouraging as to the rational management ofthe United Nations system.Thus  all the sectors where overlapping andduplication were most obvious have now been singled outwith a view to proper management that will generatesubstantial economies in the budgetary performance of theSecretariat. Here we would like to say how pleased weare that the Secretary-General was able to hold the UnitedNations budget for 1996-1997 within the strict limitsdefined by the General Assembly. The $150 million insavings are the result of a set of measures aimed atrationalizing and maximizing the cost-effectiveness ratioof the work of the Secretariat  as can be seen in the firstreport of the United Nations Efficiency Board  which wasmade public last month.5The new spirit of budgetary strictness andadministrative efficiency that is becoming prevalent withinthe Secretariat and among those in charge of the agenciesand programmes of the United Nations system seems tohave given us a new awareness of the need for self-examination and for concrete responses to the needs ofMember States.With close links between thinking and operationalactivities  and with an increasing presence on the ground the United Nations will be closer to the people  and thusbetter able to take into account their needs in a number ofareas  such as employment  education  health  humanitarianassistance and environment.Specifically on the question of humanitarianassistance  we should highlight the remarkable way inwhich the United Nations has adapted in dealing with therefugee problems resulting from internal conflicts in variousparts of the world. There are millions of displaced persons and this situation is without precedent since 1945. TheDepartment of Humanitarian Affairs  the Office of theUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees(UNHCR)  the World Food Programme (WFP) and theUnited Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) have beenparticularly effective in this area.I think these examples are enough to rehabilitate theUnited Nations in the minds of some. If we were to believeits detractors  our Organization would be bureaucratic behind the times  ineffective and yet extravagant. Whilesome of these criticisms were perhaps justified to someextent in the past  today we can say that our Organizationis moving resolutely towards reform and a structural andfunctional transformation that started a decade ago.Last year in San Francisco  50 years after the foundingof the United Nations  the international communityreaffirmed at the highest level of leadership the relevanceto today’s world of the Charter and its purposes andprinciples. Through this important act  the internationalcommunity enshrined its commitment to attaining theobjectives set out in the Charter. The Declaration of24 October 1995 also confirmed the essential tasks of theUnited Nations for the year 2000: promoting peace development  equality  justice and understanding amongpeoples. It also gave a special place to the advancement ofwomen and the protection of children.In order to carry out these tasks  in the last few yearsMember States have worked out careful strategies throughthe cycle  ending this year  of thematic conferences thatbegan in New York in 1990 with the World Summit forChildren  continued in Rio with the United NationsConference on Environment and Development  in Viennawith the World Conference on Human Rights  in Cairowith the International Conference on Population andDevelopment  in Copenhagen with the World Summit forSocial Development  in Beijing with the Fourth WorldConference on Women and in Istanbul with the SecondUnited Nations Conference on Human Settlements(Habitat II). In this connection  we should also emphasizethe importance of the upcoming World Food Summit  tobe held under the auspices of the Food and AgricultureOrganization of the United Nations (FAO) in Rome inNovember 1996. Complementing these initiatives  theAgenda for Peace and the Agenda for Developmentprovide an appropriate framework for thinking about theimportant interrelationship and interaction between peaceand development.Along the same lines  and without being exhaustivein my list  I would like to recall the progress made lastyear in the areas of peace and disarmament with thesigning on 24 September 1996 of the ComprehensiveNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. The establishment of newnuclear-weapon-free zones in South-East Asia  the SouthPacific and Africa  and measures relating to nuclear safetyand security are also positive achievements in this area.In conflict prevention  on the initiative of Canadaand the Netherlands excellent progress has been made indeveloping the rapid-reaction capability of the UnitedNations to respond to threats to peace and security. Otherinitiatives from various sources also bear witness to thegrowing concern over preventing conflicts and acting inadvance  particularly in the area of development  so as tocreate conditions for consolidating social peace inMember States.With regard to human rights and fundamentalfreedoms  I would underline the specific  dynamic andpublicly visible results of some recent United Nationsdecisions  such as the establishment of a HighCommissioner for Human Rights  the establishment andeffective functioning of International Tribunals toprosecute and judge persons accused of serious violationsof human rights in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda and measures taken  or scheduled to be taken  incombating terrorism and organized crime.For these reasons  I think we can say that the UnitedNations is now a much more coherent instrument vis-à-visits objectives  its missions and its strategies. However  we6must complete the renewal that is now under way. I havealready stressed that the Secretariat’s efforts to adapt carried out through austerity measures  are healthy  but thedividends should be used to strengthen operational activitiesfor development.The other central organs — the General Assembly  theSecurity Council and the Economic and Social Council —must make continued  deeper-going transformations toupdate their structures  their functioning and their workingmethods and adapt them to special circumstances that areunlike the post-world-conflict circumstances of 1945.In this connection  and with particular regard to theGeneral Assembly  I should say  as I did when I presidedover the forty-ninth session of the General Assembly  thatthis body  within the context of the institutional balancesprovided for in the Charter  should continue to play its fullpart in the reform process under way. The GeneralAssembly  because of its unique form of legitimacy  is stillthe best guarantor of the common interests of the MemberStates.As this fifty-first session begins  we find ourselves ata crossroads. Last October we resoundingly reaffirmed theirreplaceable nature of the United Nations. Today  showingpolitical will and above all a spirit of solidarity  we mustnow translate that commitment into action. Without thisreaffirmation of solidarity  the values on which theinternational community rests will become rathermeaningless. Our Organization must tirelessly continue toseek ways of strengthening this solidarity. We do not see itas much as we would like to  and the frustration ofdeveloping countries is growing because of situations inwhich international cooperation targets are simplydisregarded and many promises remain unkept.It is one thing to establish aid programmes and time-frames  but it is another to move ahead and actually dowhat the international community has committed itself todo. Of course  the United Nations is often judged byinternational public opinion on the basis of its ability toconsolidate peace. But its credibility also depends on itsability to act firmly in order to fill the increasingly widegap between the rich and the developing countries.It is high time that development aid found its place inan effort to mobilize  in which the actors  the industrializedcountries and the developing countries all get their fairshare. One cannot talk simultaneously about the existenceof universal values  such as democracy or human rights and still feel satisfied with a situation in which poverty andthe AIDS epidemic are steadily gaining ground  thusexacerbating the divisions within the internationalcommunity and thwarting national efforts.In this context  the effort to combat AIDS must bea subject of particular concern because of its devastatingworld-wide effects  especially in developing countries where 90 per cent of HIV-positive individuals arelocated — 60 per cent in Africa alone — but which donot have the resources to deal with this pandemic. On thequestion of access to medicines  particularly anti-retrovirus agents  it seems unacceptable to us that suchpreventive medicines are available to only 10 per cent ofthose suffering from AIDS/HIV.However  also within the context of internationalcooperation to combat AIDS  we welcome some strongaction that has been taken. For example  we welcome theEconomic and Social Council resolution making thequestion of AIDS as one of the topics for its 1997 high-level segment. We would also place great hope in thecommitments made to provide the Secretariat with anappropriate structure and relevant resources to support theUnited Nations AIDS Programme.I would like to speak more about Africa  as manyrepresentatives already have  because the picture paintedis often very far from the reality. There is little incommon between the usual cliches about the wretchedsituation in Africa and the velvet revolution which ourcountries are engaged in carrying out. We have sufferedfrom the scourge of the economic crisis which has sparedno continent. We have suffered from the globalization ofthe economy  in which we have been marginalized. We inAfrica are now beginning to reverse this trend. All thespecialists agree that Africa has set forth on the path toeconomic recovery  with an average growth rate last yearof 5 per cent.For my own country  Côte d’Ivoire  I can say thatafter the l980s  which were marked by a difficulteconomic and financial crisis  the Government adopted acoherent economic policy  backed by thorough sectoralstrategies to obtain viable  strong  self-sustaining growth.Stabilization and adjustment programmes begun in 1993enabled the Côte d’Ivoire to meet the conditions in 1994for a recovery with greater diversification in oureconomy  greater weight being given to the private sectorand careful management of public finances  and a re-centering of State control in the areas of regulationmonitoring and in the environment of economic activities.This policy enabled us to achieve a 7-per-cent growth rate7in 1995  and suggests that we can achieve double-digitgrowth in 1998  which is the goal of PresidentHenri Konan-Bédié  whose plan is to make Côte d’Ivoire atruly industrialized nation.Along with efforts to win the fight for development African countries have also committed themselves todemocratization  as can be seen  inter alia  in theorganization of multi-party elections  the establishment ofthe rule of law and the emergence of a responsible civilsociety. Backed up by true legitimacy  political leaders areabout to succeed in building modern States with theprimary purpose of ensuring national cohesion and progress.The advances that we see here and there on ourcontinent must be backed up by more sustained action bythe industrialized countries. Time is running out  and wemust move quickly from speeches  promises and goodintentions to concrete action. The adoption of the Agendafor Development ought  therefore  to be an opportunity forre-thinking the philosophy underlying developmentassistance  its mechanisms and its modalities  so that socio-economic activities can be placed at the centre of the workof the United Nations."
"34",1437,"COD",51,1996,"﻿During the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the13United Nations  States renewed our faith in the ideals of theCharter of this Organization. This means that pastexperience has given us a new vision of the world  a keenawareness of the interdependence of nations  all of whichseek to live in a work committed to peace  freedom andjustice.It is with this conviction that my delegation extends toMr. Razali Ismail the warmest congratulations of theGovernment of Zaire on his election as President of thefifty-first session of the General Assembly. We would alsolike to congratulate his fellow Assembly officers. And wealso congratulate Mr. Razali’s predecessor  His ExcellencyMr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral. The competence andintelligence he showed as he guided the work of the fiftiethsession earned him the Assembly’s appreciation.We would also like to pay a well-deserved tribute tothe Secretary-General Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  and tothe members of the Secretariat  for their untiring efforts toensure the proper functioning of our Organization and fortheir clear-sightedness and courage. Zaire also takes thisopportunity to express its support for Mr. Boutros-Ghali ashe stands for a second term as Secretary-General. This mustbe our position. His predecessors from other continents hadthis opportunity; Africa cannot accept otherwise.During this half century  our free nations have won thegreatest victories in the fields of national liberation andpolitical independence. However  as we come to the end ofthe twentieth century  we still face major challenges in theeconomic  cultural and social fields  as well as in the areaof international peace and security.Peace  freedom and stability together constitute anindispensable prerequisite for development. No part of ourEarth  no country in the world  can be really secure whilethere are still outstanding hotbeds of tension. And  today such hotbeds are on the increase  in Africa  in Asia and inCentral and Eastern Europe.The situations in Rwanda  Burundi  Somalia  Liberia Yugoslavia  Afghanistan and the Middle East are all causesfor the concern weighing on international peace andsecurity. The United Nations  which is already seized ofthese issues  should continue its efforts with theencouragement of every one of us.In Angola  a neighbouring country to Zaire  mydelegation can see positive developments in the domesticsituation. The integration of União Nacional para aIndependência Total de Angola (UNITA) forces into theAngolan National Army should be promoted andencouraged for the good of the entire population ofAngola.For more than two years  Zaire has lived with thetragedies of Burundi and Rwanda  which have lead to amassive influx of refugees from these two countries ontoits territory. This grave situation  for which my country isnot responsible  has caused and continues to cause usconsiderable human  material  environmental and otherforms of damage. In this respect  the internationalcommunity has been inexplicably reticent in its actions as if Zaire should shoulder this burden alone andindefinitely. Zaire is indeed constantly being denigratedeven to the extent that it is often falsely accused ofsupporting armed activity within Rwanda and Burundi. Amemorandum from the Government of the Republic ofZaire on the lack of security in northern and southernKivu has already been submitted to the Secretary-General.A few days ago  the Zairian towns of Bukavu  Uvira andsurrounding districts were shelled by armed elementsfrom Rwanda. The Assembly has heard Rwanda’spernicious and false representation of the facts. Inter-ethnic massacres occurred in Rwanda in 1959  1962 and1972  not to mention 1994. This genocide in Rwanda wasdesigned  developed and executed in detail and withdelight by Rwandans against Rwandans  and by that Imean by past and present leaders in power in Kigali.Members can now understand why Rwanda  nursing itsplanned aggression against my country  has refused tosign the non-aggression pact patiently negotiated by allthe States of Central Africa  including Rwanda.From this rostrum  my delegation solemnly declaresthe following: First  Zaire does not accept and will neveragain accept to act as anyone’s scapegoat. Secondly  Zairewill do all it can to defend the security of its populationand its borders  and will call on its people and its friendsin its defence. Thirdly  Zaire is always prepared tocooperate with the neighbouring Governments andpeoples of Rwanda and Burundi to ensure the voluntaryand dignified return of refugees to their respectivecountries. Failing this  following the example of certainEuropean Governments with respect to refugees andpeople without documentation  Zaire will have no choicebut to begin the enforced and unconditional return of suchpeople to their countries of origin.Fourthly  as President Mobutu stated last year in thisforum  Zaire will never accept the de facto transformationof a part of its territory into a “Hutuland”  whetherthrough a challenge to its territorial integrity or through14the establishment of refugee settlements on its territory.Anyone considering that can forget it.Fifthly  given the sacrifices endured by its people Zaire calls on the international community to implementfully the agreements that have been signed  and GeneralAssembly resolution 49/24 of 2 December 1994 on specialassistance to countries hosting refugees. Finally  Zairereaffirms the position it stated at the Copenhagen WorldSummit for Social Development regarding the holding of aworld conference on refugees and displaced persons to finda comprehensive and lasting solution to the refugeequestion  which has disastrous consequences fordevelopment  human relations and human rights.The political  economic and social situation in Zairehas deteriorated over six long years of transition. Despitethis difficult situation  Zaire has made it a point of honourto pursue its democratic process  committing itself toreestablishing the authority of the State  rebuilding the basicinfrastructure  improving the country’s economic  financialand monetary situation  ensuring the security of persons andproperty and observing human rights and fundamentalfreedoms.To date  Zaire’s main task has been to organize free democratic and transparent elections. This is why it has setup a National Electoral Commission which is now ready toget down to work  as observed by the delegation recentlysent to Zaire by the Secretary-General. Furthermore  thedraft electoral law and the bill on the organization of aconstitutional referendum are also currently underdiscussion by the Parliament of Transition. Zaire wishes toreaffirm before the entire world that the democratization ofits political system is irreversible  regardless of thedifficulties facing our country. For these reasons  theGovernment of Zaire calls on the international communityto give it effective support in the establishment of thesenew democratic institutions by June 1997 at the latest.Democracy can only develop and last in a country thatenjoys economic development that allows for the protectionand promotion of human rights. Some human rights werebeing promoted in Zaire long before the democratizationprocess. Thus  for example  despite the many social andcultural constraints  Zairian men and women enjoy politicaland vocational equality  including in terms of remuneration.The noble mission of the United Nations Commissionon Human Rights certainly merits our encouragement. Zairehas nothing to hide  and has thus accepted and accreditedthe Secretary-General’s human rights representative  whoseoffice is in our capital  Kinshasa. Nonetheless  Zairedeplores and vigorously condemns the malicious use ofthe human rights issue for political ends  as can be seenin the unfounded and unwarranted accusations levelledagainst it at each annual evaluation session of theCommission on Human Rights in Geneva.Preventive diplomacy should be the very basis ofpeace-keeping operations. However  preventive diplomacywould be meaningless if the international communitywere not to grant it a standing  mobile military sector thatcould be deployed wherever international peace andsecurity were to come under threat. Thus  in theframework of the United Nations Standing AdvisoryCommittee on Security Questions in Central Africa  thecountries of this subregion  with the exception of Rwanda signed the non-aggression pact at the latest Organizationof African Unity (OAU) summit in Yaoundé.In this first year of the second half-century of theUnited Nations  safeguarding peace and cohesion amongpeoples are issues of vital importance to all of us. Zaireconsiders the adoption of the resolution recommendingsignature of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treatyat the fiftieth session of the General Assembly to be animportant step towards comprehensive nucleardisarmament. We do  of course  recognize that this is nota perfect Treaty. It lacks the firm commitment of nuclear-weapon States to renounce the use and threat of use ofsuch weapons in their relations with other States. It alsolacks a precise timetable for complete destruction ofexisting weapons. It does not mention the banning ofnuclear tests in laboratories  which is the mostsophisticated modern way of developing such weapons.Despite these imperfections  Zaire joined thosedelegations that sponsored the resolution  and it voted infavour of the text proposed. I wish to announce officiallythat Zaire will sign this text tomorrow  4 October.From this rostrum we appeal to the nuclear-weaponStates to put aside their selfish interests and to committhemselves firmly to the new path set out by the Treaty so that the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons canbecome a living reality and so that nuclear weapons willno longer threaten future generations  as they have donesince the end of the Second World War.We cannot be at peace with ourselves if we fail totake firm action for conventional disarmament as well.I come from a region where the merchants of deathhave dumped tons and tons of conventional weapons that15kill people daily. We urge countries that manufacture andsell these instruments of death to stop taking satisfaction inthe positive balance sheets of their international trade which includes arms sales. This is a shame for all mankind.To those who would give lessons of morality and ethics  wewould insist that they look at the way they live and stopsowing death and suffering. Life and happiness are the mostfundamental of human rights.In addition to disarmament  worldwide elimination ofpoverty is fundamental to the strengthening of peace andthe realization of comprehensive  sustainable development.At the dawn of the third millennium  it is deplorable to notethat more than a billion people today live under conditionsof unacceptable poverty and are outside the mainstream ofeconomic and social progress because of imbalances in theinternational economy.My delegation hopes that  to remedy this situation  theNorth-South dialogue will be guided more by theimperatives and interests of mutual advantage and benefit as well as by genuine interdependence. Solidarity demandsfairer prices for commodities  access to the markets ofdeveloped countries  easing the debt burden and increasedofficial development assistance so as to ensure sustainedgrowth and sustainable development.Last year we commemorated our Organization’sfiftieth anniversary. That occasion was an opportunity forus to focus on the possibilities for an appropriate reform ofthis Organization  which is unique in its mission and itsimpact. I would like to offer my country’s reflections onthis subject.We are now living in a period of extraordinarycontrasts. Despite the historic successes of our Organization— including independence for many countries  the peaceprocess under way in the Middle East  the end of the SouthAfrican saga and the perceptible tendency of the UnitedNations towards universality — we must observe with somebitterness that areas of tension have flared up worldwide sparking anarchy  despair  poverty and death.For this reason  Zaire believes that the SecurityCouncil  which is the United Nations body that hasforemost responsibility for maintaining international peaceand security  and which by its present membership is nolonger representative  should be expanded and itsfunctioning improved. In this exercise  the main concernshould be to correct the clear imbalance in that body.Expansion of the Council should take into account the willof many countries to become members and the importanceof safeguarding its effectiveness. It should avoid makingit a body dependent on the General Assembly. For thatreason  we think that equitable geographic representationwould appropriately remedy the glaring imbalance in thecurrent representation of the Security Council. Weencourage the international community to give deepthought to this question and not to forget that onecontinent — Africa — is at the greatest disadvantage withthe current composition of the Council.We refuse to be dragged into the dispute over theveto power of permanent members. We are against theemergence of a category of permanent second-classmembers in the Security Council.There is a need to look for ways to improve thefunctioning of the Security Council. It is inconceivablethat a State that is concerned in a question beingdiscussed in the Council can participate only in a formalmeeting — if there is one — to hear the decision made.If the State were officially involved in the informalconsultations on that issue  its direct contribution to themembers of the Council could enable them to adoptdecisions that would be well thought out and realisticrather than being imposed.We must have the courage to put an end to the anti-democratic character of this important United Nationsbody. All the parties involved should be given theopportunity to defend themselves before the members ofthe Council. This is a basic rule of the administration ofjustice.We take note of the report of the Open-endedWorking Group on the Question of EquitableRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of theSecurity Council  and we encourage it to pursue itsconsideration of this matter."
"35",1484,"COG",51,1996,"﻿The delegation of the Republic of the Congowishes to express to the President its warmestcongratulations on his election to lead the fifty-first sessionof the General Assembly.My country is particularly pleased by this choice  asit attests to the international community’s recognition of theconstant and active commitment of his country to ensuringthe triumph of the ideals of peace sought by the UnitedNations. I have no doubt that under his guidance thissession will help humankind take new strides towards peaceand progress.To his predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Diogo Freitasdo Amaral  I would like to express our great appreciationfor all he did in spite of the trying international conditions which were continually complicated by human actions.Finally  from this rostrum  my delegation wishes towelcome the tremendous efforts of the Secretary-General Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali over the past five years. All hiswork has contributed greatly to the specific efforts ofMember States to ensure that our universal institution isbetter able to meet the many challenges of our times andmore likely to avail itself of the many opportunities of thecoming century to ensure that humanity will prosper.The idea of humankind prospering leads me to wonderwhether such a phenomenon can become universal at a timewhen  despite the efforts of the United Nations there are somany differences between nations around the world  somany contradictions and conflicting interests between richand poor countries and  in Africa in particular  betweenthose who wield political power and those who seek it frequently using armed force.However  it must be emphasized that far from beingthe by-product of a sombre period in the history ofhumankind  the United Nations remains after more than halfa century  the best instrument for achieving andconsolidating peace  for the progress of humankind and forpreserving diversity around the globe. It also remains aplace of legal equality between nations and a crucible ofthe ideals of humanism in which the interests and thedestinies of all continents and all peoples should be fusedbut not confused.This being said  the vision of the founding fathers ofthe United Nations is yet to become a reality. This ispossible only if Member States are truly committed tostriving for such ideals. Is it Utopian for the increasinglyfragile nations to do this when they are trying to findtheir own equilibrium? Unfortunately  it is very temptingto say yes  as our world is increasingly divided betweenthose who have knowledge and wealth and those who aresinking in ignorance  disease  war and poverty.In saying this to this Assembly  I  who come froma continent on the brink of oblivion  am not tellinganyone anything new. I beg the Assembly’s indulgence torepeat the same prayer  the same cry of distress  alreadyvoiced here  now and in the past  by our eminentpredecessors.They have said many times  more eloquently than Ican  that Africa  51 years later  is an ailing continent atwhose bedside the commonly held notion of internationalsolidarity should be translated into resolutions and quicklyfollowed by actions. The wealthiest countries will thenhave helped thousands of human beings to join themodern era through scientific and technological progress.This is a major challenge that calls for foresight humanism and the mobilization of the richest countries ifour world is to be in a better position to deal peacefullywith the stakes of the future in the North and the South.In this connection  the process of the democratizationand economic integration of Africa should be furtherencouraged and supported by the international community.This is the basis for liberating all the creative Africanforces that used to be held in check by dictatorial regimesthat were not well disposed to fostering intellectualdevelopment.The end of dictatorial regimes in certain Africancountries and the spread of the democratization process inAfrica does not automatically mean the establishment oftruly democratic institutions  as the democrats in countrieswith democratic systems may have wished.Caught between seeking its future and reconcilingthe present with its past  Africa must  with universalsupport  find modern institutional means of curbing thepolitical tension that frequently results from tribalistic or13clannish view of power  which in turn results in the civilwars that so hamper the continent in its march towardspeace.Seen in this way  democratic pluralism should be ameasure of our march towards progress and  at this stage make peace the stabilizing and constant factor ofdemocratic institutions. It should also  and above all  ensurethat peace is a decisive factor in human development inAfrica.Our continent can no longer take democracy to meanthe mechanical imposition of some model of democraticinstitutions while forgetting our historical baggage or givingin to the temptation to undo with the stroke of a pen thebases of our social and cultural values.It was by seeking a true balance between peace anddemocratic institutions that the President of the Republic ofthe Congo was able to restore peace in our country aftertwo years of civil war  following the democratic electionsthat brought him to power. By this same philosophy  havingintegrated members of the major opposing political partyinto the Government of the Republic  Mr. Pascal Lissoubasupports the idea of a necessary period of democratictransition. This period is one of adapting the variouspolitical actors to the needs of the democratic regime particularly to the principle of political change-over withthe preservation of our values based upon sharing  solidarityand respect for authority.We are convinced that an approach based on theconcept of participatory democracy will make it possible toreduce the sources of conflict between those who have beenelected by the people and those who have lost indemocratic elections without affecting in the least the rulesof the democratic regime  particularly the principles ofequality  liberty and the right of the people to choose theirmain leaders.We think that African democracy  freed from thedangers of political individualism  the temptations of powerfor oneself and the torments of tribalism  even with thelegacy of political systems of the past  can become a factorfor pacification  a fairer distribution of the fruits ofcollective efforts and social and economic progress.In this vision  the present weakness of our politicalsystems can be regarded as a phase in the democratictransition to a modern developed Africa only if theinternational community fully realizes that democracycannot prosper in poor countries  where politics were for solong the road to social success  without exposing ourcitizens to the political games of those for whom theadvent of democracy and its attendant competitiveelections mean the end of the eminent position they enjoyin society thanks to the exercise of political power. Thevarious civil wars that repeatedly cast a shadow over ourcontinent are sad testimony to this reality.Therefore  assistance to promote economicdevelopment in African countries that are committed tothe democratization of their institutions will result in theemergence of new political classes that are protected fromneed and that will be more likely to regard politics as ameans of governing a community of men and womenwho are bound by a territory and a common destiny thanas the only means to get ahead in an economically poorenvironment.As the Assembly can imagine  the economicdevelopment of Africa is a decisive factor for stability development  pacification and democratization. Thecurrent world economic situation is clear evidence thatglobalization is inevitable. However  globalization couldalso have serious drawbacks if measures are not adoptedto rectify fundamental imbalances. Increased competitionmeans poor countries  particularly those in the sub-Saharan region  will risk losing more market shares andwill be increasingly marginalized.If it is first and foremost up to the African countriesto demonstrate that their marginalization is determinedonly by fate and that their current situation is merely oneof those tragic aftermaths with which history hasfrequently sprinkled the course of human events  then itis also up to the international community as a whole  inactive solidarity  to make a special commitment tosupporting the efforts of the African countries to dealwith the challenges before them.This is why I must emphasize the role ofinternational cooperation and  particularly  the importanceof official development assistance for our countries. Thisassistance  important in principle  should be enhancedwith action  in accordance with commitments that wereentered into  in order to meet the needs of the poorestpopulations and to make Governments better able to meettheir obligations. Unfortunately  the decrease in such aidruns counter to this view.My country is pleased to note the Secretary-General’s Special Initiative to help Africa  whichreinforces the United Nations New Agenda for the14Development of Africa in the 1990s. The mid-term reviewfalls far short of our expectations  however. The Congosupports the recommendations emerging from thatassessment and hopes that the international community willdo its utmost to respect its commitments towards Africa.Earlier I mentioned the tragedies of the Africanpeoples caused by civil war. My country  the Congo  whichsince March 1995 has presided over the Standing AdvisoryCommittee of the United Nations on Security Questions inCentral Africa  would like to say how pleased it is to notethat in Angola  as well as in Bosnia and Herzegovina  theparties are endeavouring to implement the peace agreementsand are thus enjoying the support of the internationalcommunity. We must welcome the efforts of the EconomicCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS) to settle theLiberian conflict  and we are pleased to note the signing ofthe new peace Agreement  which  in the light of currentpolitical developments in that country  gives us reasons forhope.However  we are deeply concerned by the situation insome other parts of the world. The recent  spiralling acts ofviolence in the Middle East and the number of civiliancasualties have weighed heavily on the peace process. TheRepublic of the Congo emphasizes the importance of anearly resumption of dialogue  with a view to continuing thepeace process in the Middle East.The Republic of the Congo welcomes progress innuclear disarmament  particularly the opening for signaturelast 24 September of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-BanTreaty (CTBT). This historic act strengthens the extensionof the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons(NPT) and will promote international relations based uponpeaceful coexistence and trust between States. This is thecourse of action chosen by African countries in thePelindaba Treaty  which makes Africa a nuclear-free zone.We must express our deep concern over the situationsin Africa in which peace is threatened daily  both withinnational borders and between States. By establishing theUnited Nations Standing Advisory Committee on SecurityQuestions in Central Africa  the General Assembly hasestablished a cooperative framework that will enable11 States from Central Africa to engage in dialogue inorder to build confidence among themselves and establishtheir own machinery to facilitate the prevention management and settlement of conflicts in the subregion.The first summit of the Heads of State and Government held on 8 July 1996 in Yaoundé  Cameroon  led to thesigning of a non-aggression pact.We want to express our sincere thanks to thecountries  particularly Japan  that have contributed to thespecial trust fund to implement the Committee’sprogramme. That fund made it possible to hold inYaoundé  under the auspices of the United Nations  aseminar for training specialized units of peace operations.I would also like to express the Committee’s thanksto President Julius Nyerere for his role in finding apeaceful solution to the Burundi crisis. The Governmentof the Congo calls upon all parties to the conflict inBurundi  a fraternal country and a member of theAdvisory Committee  to regain control of the situationand to create through dialogue conditions for a return topeace and national reconciliation.Before concluding  I would like to mention somerecent developments in the economic and politicalsituation in my country. Since the National Forum for theCulture of Peace organized with the support of UnitedNations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization(UNESCO) in Brazzaville in December 1995 and thesigning of a peace pact among the various politicalparties  we are more than ever determined to address themost crucial issues before our country  namely consolidating peace and combating poverty.At the initiative of His Excellency President PascalLissouba  all the Congolese political forces have signeda framework agreement on census-taking with a view toprepare the second presidential election of our democraticera. The recently appointed Government is endeavouringto organize these elections in transparency  peace andrespect for deadlines. In order to meet its commitmentsthe Government of Congo will be able to count on theUnited Nations  friendly countries and all those whopromote the consolidation of democracy in Africa.The signing on 20 June of a strengthened structuraladjustment mechanism with the International MonetaryFund ensures that our people will support an economicand social recovery programme despite the manysacrifices it will entail. These efforts will be pursued withthe same commitment in the hope that our country willreceive the support of the international community at theround table of donor countries to be held at Geneva inNovember.Congo  freed from the burdens that have delayed itsdevelopment for so long and mortgaged its future  willfinally be able to offer its people the peace and progressfor which they have been waiting so long."
"36",1531,"COL",51,1996,"﻿Allow me at the outset  Sir  to congratulate youon your election as President of the current session of theGeneral Assembly. I salute you in my capacity as Chairmanof the Non-Aligned Movement  which has found in yourbackground a close identity with the defence of the interestsof the developing countries. The same is true of theSecretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  whohonoured us with his attendance at the last Non-AlignedMovement summit  held at Cartagena de Indias.Over the past several years in Colombia  we have beenwaging a difficult war against drug trafficking. In thatbattle  judges  police officers  journalists and innocentcivilians have lost their lives: more than 20 000 people inthe last 10 years. In fact  last week in the southern part ofthe country more than 50 soldiers of the Colombia armywho were destroying illicit crops and cocaine processinglaboratories in the jungle region were massacred byguerrillas engaged in the defence of drug traffickinginterests. The mother of one of those murdered youngmen — a 17-year-old soldier — asked me the followingday with tears in her eyes: “Why”?Allow me today to try to answer that mother and allthose who have been victims of this war  not only inColombia  but around the world. Values  democracy andnational security are threatened. We are waging this warto preserve and protect those values; to protect andpreserve our youth and our democratic form ofgovernment; but above all to protect our national security.No country in the world must ignore the battle againstdrugs. This war is occurring today in every country owing to the broad power of powerful internationalcriminal and terrorist organizations which have extendedtheir tentacles over the entire planet.Now that the cold war has ended  the United Nationsand the world must design and develop a strategy to putan immediate end to the greatest threat to the world’ssecurity and stability today: the threat of drugs. It is anepidemic that  more than any other war  can underminethe value structure which supports the governability ofdemocratic systems.As we prepare for the twenty-first century  I inviteall world leaders present or represented here today  to acollective and above all sincere reflection on thisproposal  which Colombia presents with the moral authorityit has been granted  having been the nation which hassuffered most  which has invested most  and which has paidthe highest social and economic costs in this struggleagainst drug trafficking.In recent years  Colombia has spent 14 times moreresources fighting drug trafficking than what is investedannually by the international community through the UnitedNations system for the same purpose. Thanks to thisdetermined effort  Colombia has been able to avoid theannual distribution throughout the world of more than6 billion doses intended for drug users.I  too  have been a victim of drug trafficking. Severalyears ago I was the target of an assassination attempt thatalmost cost me my life. I received 11 bullet wounds  andstill carry four bullets in my body. More recently I fellvictim to another assassination attempt  this time of a moralnature. I was accused of having allowed money from acartel to infiltrate my campaign. Despite that  from the veryfirst day of my Administration we have workedsuccessfully to arrest the criminals and completely destroythe powerful Cali cartel.I thank God that I survived that assault too. TheCongress of the Republic of Colombia  which  under ourConstitution is the judge of the President  completelyexonerated me of all charges after a long trial that Ipersonally requested be held in public. Barely 48 hours ago before coming to the Assembly  I was the victim of yetanother attempt. Heroin was smuggled onto my aeroplanein order to shame Colombia and its democraticGovernment. This new attempt proved that the criminalorganizations have the power and the capability to penetratealmost every institution in our society  anywhere in theworld. However  I stand here today  before this worldAssembly of democracy  with complete dignity becausenobody will stop me from presenting to the worldColombia’s proposals to deal with the drug organizations.I am speaking to the Assembly today bearing thepainful scars of those encounters. Similar scars are borneby all Colombians who have been physically injured bydrug terrorism or morally wounded by internationalmisunderstanding. I am not here to complain; I am here topropose a solution to this modern-day epidemic. I amconvinced that the world is losing the war against drugs.The solution will have to be as global as the problem itself.It will have to be as swift and irreversible as the damagethat drugs and crime are causing to the minds of the youngdrug users of the world.The achievements of Colombia and other countriesdo not imply that the problem of drug trafficking hasbeen eradicated throughout the world. The drug problemwill be resolved only when all countries  withoutexception and without hypocrisy  shoulder their ownresponsibilities  which cannot be delegated to others.To achieve this  we must set out the parameters fora great anti-drug alliance  which include immediate anddecisive action. If we do not accomplish this  drugtrafficking  the most sinister transnational enterprise in theworld  whose resources equal $500 billion per year —more than those of the world-wide petroleum industry —will continue to corrupt and contaminate our peoples.The statistics on international action to date are notvery encouraging. Drug use continues to increase underthe tolerant attitudes of some Governments  and the levelof drug seizures and confiscation barely exceeds 10 percent of the total of such drugs circulating in the world. Inthe face of this demoralizing reality we have only twoalternatives: mutual recrimination  or cooperation. Eitherwe continue to criticize each other  or we work together.Multilateral focus on the problem is the only alternative;interventionism is not the way. The only end thatunilateral or interventionist measures achieve  as we haveseen recently  is to break mutual trust  weaken the abilityof Governments to take action  and open the way for theconsolidation of criminal organizations.Colombia proposes an agenda of global actionagainst drugs  based on the principles of sharedresponsibility  equality and an integrated approach: sharedresponsibility  because we are all responsible for theproblem of ethical  political  social and economiccontamination produced by drug trafficking throughoutthe world; equality  because no country should assume theright to judge the conduct of another on a subject thatinvolves the responsibility of all on standards ofbehaviour that are worldwide and collective; andintegration  because every phase of the process — fromagricultural production  to industrial processing  transport distribution  consumption  and money laundering — mustbe addressed simultaneously  and with the same energy.Colombia wants to be part of the solution. We donot want to continue to be demonized by the world when in fact  we are victims  as all peoples are. The issues forthe global agenda against drugs are as follows: first  withregard to the establishment of a social machinery for theeradication of illegal crops  it is not enough to eradicate2such crops if we are not capable of offering alternativesolutions for small peasant farmers.Colombia endorses the innovative proposal of FrenchPresident Jacques Chirac to create a mechanism to enablethe purchase of produce grown as alternatives for illegalcrops at prices that closely approximate those paid for coca opium poppies and marijuana. The establishment of thismechanism should be accompanied by a commitment toaerial and manual eradication over five years  which wouldlead to the elimination of these illicit crops throughout theworld.Secondly  we need controls on the trafficking ofchemical precursors and weapons  which are speeding drugtrafficking and the violence that it generates. The UnitedNations system must define  within the framework of theVienna Convention  specific guidelines to regulate the pre-shipment certification of chemical precursors todrug-producing countries  and contribute to producingeffective systems to control arms sales to those samedestinations.As regards a mandate to combat money laundering only decisive action against the profits generated by thedrug business can stop the recycling of these resources intoproduction and distribution centres. Eighty per cent of drugtrafficking money circulates through the economic andfinancial channels of the industrialized nations. We needmuch stricter controls on the banking system and onindustries whose smuggling of goods and services are beingused to launder this drug money.We propose that the mandate of the Europeanagreement governing money laundering  investigation seizure and forfeiture of assets derived from drugtrafficking be extended to the global level. Concurrently  weshould expand globally those decisions reached at theWorld Ministerial Conference on Organized TransnationalCrime held at Naples in 1994.As regards a worldwide intelligence centre forcooperation in operations against cartels and drugtrafficking networks  we believe that in dealing withinternational crime which starts in one place  continues inanother and ends at the point of consumption  the combinedaction of all countries is required to develop the necessaryintelligence and police operations to seize shipments dismantle networks and pursue domestic drug dealers anddistributors. Colombia proposes such an organization of aworldwide intelligence centre against drugs. This centrewould coordinate the collection of evidence from everypolice force in the world to fight the unified multinationaldrug traffickers with an equally unified response.As regards programmes which effectively curbdemand  statistics worryingly show that consumption isgrowing  not declining  and that it is doing so in the mostvulnerable sectors of our society: among young peopleand ethnic minorities. Unless we curb demand  the task offighting supply will be ineffective in achieving adefinitive solution to the problem.One cannot place the entire burden of drug fightingon drug-producing countries  which are the weakest link.We are speaking of a market that must be controlled fromboth sides. Starting with an agreement on the goals forthe reduction of consumption  we propose the adoption ofan integrated plan that includes prevention campaigns action by non-governmental organizations and publichealth initiatives accompanied by stricter laws against thedistribution and consumption of illegal drugs.Finally  we propose a world treaty of judicialcooperation in the war against drugs and terrorism whichmust have no frontiers. Recognizing the sovereign rightof every nation to apply justice in its own territory forcrimes committed within its boundaries  no nation shouldagree to be used as a refuge or sanctuary for organizedcrime. Judicial reciprocity and assistance in the exchangeof evidence  the criminalization and judicial seizure ofassets derived from drug trafficking and terrorism extradition and the creation of high-security prisons withstandards subject to international monitoring must be anintegral part of this strategy.Without undermining bilateral or regionalagreements  these judicial cooperation agreements wouldestablish the basis for the eventual formation of aninternational tribunal against organized crime. Signatorycountries would submit international criminals such asarms dealers  drug traffickers  money launderers andterrorists to the jurisdiction of this tribunal according tothe terms of their participation agreements.Colombia proposes to this Assembly the formationof a group of experts who would be charged withdeveloping a timetable and action plan for this proposedglobal agenda for the war against drugs. An initial reviewof the group’s progress could be made at the 1998 specialsession of the General Assembly which has beenproposed by the Government of Mexico. The group ofexperts should be formed in four months’ time  andColombia will be pleased to host its first meeting. I call3on world leaders to communicate to Colombia theirrecommendations on how best to organize the work of thisgroup of experts.The globalization of problems in today’s world istaking place much faster than the globalization of solutions.Terrorism  and drugs and arms trafficking do not respecteither national boundaries or barriers. Developing countrieshave fewer opportunities and more limited resources toconfront the invasive power of these threats  in the face ofwhich there are neither weak nor strong  only victims.I invoke the memory of those killed by these warswhich will also exist in the next century. I invoke ourchildren’s future  threatened by bombs  illegal drugs andguns. I invoke the plain cause of the coexistence of theworld in order to commit ourselves to this formidable taskof blocking the path of organized crime which todaychallenges our right to govern the world in peace. Finally I invoke the tears of all the mothers and youths of theworld who have been sacrificed in the fight against drugsor through their use. May God illuminate our path that wemay continue this battle."
"37",1571,"COM",51,1996,"﻿Allow me at the outset to address to thePresident the sincere congratulations of the delegation ofthe Comoros on his brilliant election to the presidency ofthe General Assembly at its fifty-first session. Mycountry  the Federal Islamic Republic of the Comoros  isdelighted by his election because  in our eyes  it is aunanimous tribute from the international community to hisgreat  friendly country  Malaysia  with which theComoros maintains excellent relations of cooperation andfriendship. This choice is also a tribute to his personalqualifications as a veteran diplomat respected by all.I also take this opportunity to convey our profoundthanks to his predecessor  Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaralof Portugal  for the devotion and skill with which heconducted the work of the fiftieth session of the GeneralAssembly.To Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  the Secretary-General  that intrepid artisan of the lofty ideals of peace solidarity and justice  I should like to pay a well-deservedtribute for the efforts that he continuously makes for thebenefit of our world Organization.My country adheres entirely to the YaoundéDeclaration adopted by the Heads of State andGovernment at the thirty-second session of theOrganization of African Unity (OAU)  which recommendsthe candidature of Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali for asecond term.Last year  the United Nations commemorated withfanfare its fiftieth anniversary. More than 129 Heads ofState and Government solemnly reaffirmed the ideals of17the maintenance of peace  the peaceful settlement ofdisputes and the strengthening of international cooperationand development. In the Declaration adopted at thatcommemorative meeting  the indispensable role of theUnited Nations was recognized by all. That is why thesovereign leaders of the world also called for the UnitedNations to be reformed and attuned to the requirements ofmodern times.An objective analysis has made it possible to see thatthe structure of the Organization no longer corresponds tothe realities of today’s world  which is changing at theeconomic  political and geographic levels. At a time ofglobalization  when science and technology arerevolutionizing communications  the interdependence ofnations is emerging as an incontrovertible fact  anddemocracy is the only path of salvation for the peoples ofthe world  our Organization simply cannot and should notkeep a body reserved exclusively to certain States on apermanent basis while the great majority has onlytemporary access to it.In other words  Security Council reform is urgent andimperative if we are to act in accordance with the principleof the sovereign equality of States. In that connection  theItalian proposal for the reform of the Security Counciloffers specific advantages in terms of the possibility ofaccess to the Council for small and medium-sized States.No one denies the considerable role of the UnitedNations in the establishment of a global society that is morejust and peaceful and better integrated. But everyoneremembers the historic conditions of its creation. The endof the cold war  the elaboration of a number of conventionsand treaties on disarmament and the non-proliferation ofweapons of mass destruction are  in our view  moral valuesthat guarantee the emergence of a world of peace in whichthe right to life and well-being will win out over barbarismand brute force.At the dawn of the third millennium  the UnitedNations represents the only recourse for the emancipationof peoples and the eradication of poverty. In thisconnection  we must emphasize the considerable work doneby the Organization’s specialized agencies to help Statesrequiring assistance in their daily struggle againstunderdevelopment.There is no need to recall that  in the past five years our Organization has initiated and organized a number ofthematic conferences aimed at identifying solutions capableof inspiring States in their national policy-making. Theseinclude the New York World Summit for Children  theRio Conference on Environment and Development  theVienna World Conference on Human Rights  the CairoInternational Conference on Population and Development the Copenhagen World Summit for Social Development the Beijing Fourth World Conference on Women and more recently  the United Nations Conference on HumanSettlements (Habitat II) at Istanbul. We are also entitledto hope that next November’s Rome World Food Summitwill offer effective guidance in this vital area.The founding fathers of our Organization  recallingthe horrors and atrocities of the Second World War bequeathed to us an instrument that grants primacy to lawand dialogue. Unfortunately  other modern scourges  suchas genocide  ethnic cleansing  occupation and civil warhave continued to raise the clamour of weapons withinStates.The victims of these new wars are the same as thoseof yesterday’s — women  children and the elderly.The resurgence of violence in the Middle East in thepast few days  arising from the many provocationsorchestrated by the new Israeli authorities  throws into thequestion the peace process  which recognizes theinalienable right of the Palestinian people to a sovereignand independent State.For my country  the resumption of the peace processnecessarily involves a withdrawal of Israeli troops fromoccupied territories of the Golan and southern Lebanon.The closing of the tunnel under the Al-Aqsa Mosque is asine qua non for reducing tensions and halting theviolence. During the past 30 years of warfare in theMiddle East  the victims have been and remain thecivilian populations. No one can forget the Gulf war or itsconsequences for all parties concerned.My country urges Iraq to seek a solution that wouldensure the peace and security of its neighbours andinclude respect for the independence and territorialintegrity of Kuwait. In this connection  the question ofKuwaiti prisoners detained by Iraq is a concern  thesettlement of which would send a signal of willingnessfor appeasement.The illegal occupation of the islands of Tunb andAbu Musa by Iran is also a source of tension in that partof the world. The United Arab Emirates is sparing noeffort to recover peacefully that integral part of itsterritory.18The embargoes imposed on the Libyan and Iraqipeoples are of concern to my country. Our Organizationmust seek ways and means to enable the parties concernedto begin a dialogue aimed at a solution that would alleviatethe suffering of the civilian populations of these countries.The advent of a democratic and multiracial SouthAfrica and the peace restored to Angola and Mozambiqueshould not make us overlook the fact that the Africancontinent is still a theatre of conflict. Like the internationalcommunity  my country remains concerned over thedeterioration of the situation and the persistence of violencein Burundi. Only a return to constitutional order and torepublican legality can reduce tensions and foster a dialoguebetween all the people of Burundi. We encourage PresidentMwalimu Julius Nyerere in his mediation efforts aimed ata peaceful solution.The recent Abuja Agreement on Liberia offers aglimmer of hope for peace  provided that all the factionsobserve the current ceasefire and participate in thedisarmament and demobilization of troops.The Government of Sierra Leone and theRevolutionary United Front have made a commitment tonegotiation in order to put an end to the tragic fratricidalwar in that country. We can only encourage such initiativesand commend Côte d’Ivoire for its mediation.The situation in Somalia warrants special attention. Itdemonstrates the inability of the international community tofind a viable solution to the Somali tragedy.The question of Western Sahara also requires in-depthconsideration on the part of our Organization  because thisquestion involves safeguarding the unity and territorialintegrity of a State Member of our Organization  theKingdom of Morocco.Fortunately  other conflicts are coming to an end.Thus  the recent elections in Bosnia and Herzegovina marka decisive new stage in the consolidation of peace andsecurity — the only condition that would make nationalreconstruction possible in that country long devastated bywar.The world has become a global village fraught withinequality for its inhabitants. Indeed  the new worldeconomic order and development strategies have notbridged the gap separating the rich and poor countries. Themid-term review of the United Nations New Agenda for theDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s has made it possible tonote that the Agenda has not had the desired impact ondevelopment  despite its harmonized priorities andobjectives. But we dare to hope that the United NationsSystem-wide Special Initiative for Africa  whichcomplements the New Agenda  will stimulate the processand accelerate the integration of Africa into theinternational trading system. For now  small States canonly expect a continued drop in the prices of their rawmaterials and an increasingly unbearable debt burden.The Federal Islamic Republic of the Comoros  asmall island State that is among the least developed  isone of those excluded from international trade because  inaddition to its limited natural resources and the high costof international transport  other political and structuralconstraints have been brought to bear that bridle its socio-economic development.The recent history of my country has beencharacterized by a series of tragedies. The Assembly willcertainly recall the dramatic events of September 1995 inthe wake of the invasion of the country by mercenaries.This aroused the indignation of the internationalcommunity and brought true economic and social disasterto my country. The people of the Comoros have sufferedtoo deeply from repeated attempts at destabilizationfomented from abroad. We appeal to the internationalcommunity to ensure that such practices — which belongto another era — come to an end throughout the world.I take this opportunity to reiterate our profoundgratitude to France  whose military intervention  requestedby the Government of the Comoros in accordance withthe defence agreements between our two countries  madeit possible to rout the mercenaries. In the same context I am pleased to pay a vibrant tribute to the Organizationof African Unity for the decisive role it played inrestoring constitutional order.We also extend our gratitude to the United Nationsand all those who  near or far  contributed to theorganization of the first free  democratic and transparentelections  which brought President Mohamed TakiAbdoulkarim to the highest office of my country.This short overview of conditions in the Comorosdemonstrates the extent to which the newly elected Headof State has inherited a catastrophic situation characterized by an exorbitant external debt  an emptyState treasury and months of unpaid salaries forgovernment officials.19Yet  strengthened by his popular legitimacy and thesupport of a broad majority of the people of the Comoros in six months President Taki drafted the broad outlines ofpolitical  economic and social reforms to overcome thenumerous obstacles impeding the construction of ademocratic  prosperous and interdependent society in theComoros. A vast programme was set up in the economicand financial sphere that included financial stabilizationmeasures  a State audit  monitoring of civil servants and arecovery of State movable property and real estate. Theresults are promising and  for the first time  there are casesof corruption and embezzlement of government fundsbefore the Comorian justice system.In this series of reforms  the private sector has prideof place. That is why the Government is disengaging itselffrom the monopoly it has enjoyed in many sectors which ithas turned over to dynamic privatization that generatesgrowth.Official contacts have been opened with financialinstitutions and development partners of the Comoros inorder to establish a structural adjustment programme withthe International Monetary Fund and the World Bank torestore my country’s credibility.In the social sphere  ministerial departments — interalia  those of national education and public health — havemobilized their energies to rehabilitate these very sensitiveand vital sectors. An international conference on educationin the Comoros is planned for next December and we inviteall friendly countries  international and regional bodies toparticipate in that important meeting  aimed at mobilizingthe necessary resources to finance education that meets theexpectations of Comorian youth.In the political and institutional sectors  the incredibleproliferation of small political parties and a jury-riggedConstitution that is ineffective and difficult to implementhave seriously hampered the new democratic process. Thus the new presidential majority  comprised of more than 18political parties out of the 25 that have been officiallyrecognized  has merged into one great national politicalmovement. A consultative commission comprised of all theactive forces within the nation — political parties  tradeunions and human rights and environmental associations —has been working to amend the Constitution. Their draftwill be submitted for approval this month to the Comorianpeople in a referendum. As soon as it is adopted  legislativeand regional elections will be held to set up a parliamentfor the country and municipal institutions for the regions.After 2l years of independence  the Comoros are stillbeing built. President Mohamed Taki Abdoulkarim isaware of what is at stake. He knows that we must firstrely on our own efforts  but he also knows that he mayrely on the effective support of the internationalcommunity  especially the United Nations and itsspecialized agencies  including the United NationsDevelopment Programme  the United Nations Children’sFund  the World Health Organization and the Food andAgriculture Organization of the United Nations  to whichwe reiterate our complete confidence and deep gratitudefor their efforts towards the development of the Comoros.From this rostrum  I solemnly appeal to theinternational community to give special economicassistance to the Federal Islamic Republic of theComoros.I cannot conclude my statement without mentioningthe question of the Comorian island of Mayotte  which ison the fifty-first session’s agenda as a separate item. Atthe appropriate time  I will not fail to detail developmentsand to express our hope of a settlement in the wake of thedemocratic changes that have occurred in the Comoros inthe past six months.The end of the twentieth century challenges ourcollective conscience to build a better world for futuregenerations — a world without war and without poverty a world in which injustice  violence  drugs  terrorism andfundamentalism will no longer exist. Of course  one mightsay that such a world is impossible because profit-seeking  protectionism and intolerance are obstacles toprogress and hindrances to the well-being of humanity.But progress in science  technology and medicinereinforces our optimism.It is in this spirit that our faith is revived in a UnitedNations that is more dynamic and more democratic  aUnited Nations in which the rule of numbers will carry asmuch weight as the rule of strength."
"38",1610,"CPV",51,1996,"﻿It is with greatpleasure that I convey to you  Mr. President  mycongratulations on your election to guide the work of thissession of the General Assembly. At the same time I extendcongratulations to the country that you represent with suchdistinction. Your outstanding qualities guarantee acompetent presidency  which will certainly contribute to thesuccess of our work.I should also like to express my special appreciationfor the enlightened and committed leadership of yourpredecessor  Mr. Freitas do Amaral  who  in the course ofthe historic fiftieth session of the General Assembly  madean undeniable contribution to the continued progress of theUnited Nations.I also take this opportunity to express the highestappreciation of my delegation for the vision  initiative anddetermination that have characterized the work of theSecretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  in hispursuit of the noble objectives of our Organization. It iswith pleasure that I reiterate here the support of mycountry for his re-election.Cape Verde  being a small developing country thatis particularly affected by drought and desertification  andwithout any means of defence  has every reason to placea great deal of hope in the success of the United Nations particularly with respect to the fulfilment of the principlesand the goals of its Charter  such as the promotion ofpeace and security  social and economic development  theprotection and defence of the environment  human rightsand international law.But small countries are not the only ones looking tothe United Nations with hope. In today’s world  wheninterdependencies are increasing and globalization isspreading to a growing number of sectors of humankind’sactivity  the existence and the work of our Organizationis becoming more and more indispensable to all nationsof the globe.Governments are  in fact  more clearly aware of theneed for international forums in which  throughaccommodation  they can reach consensus and decide onglobal policies  strategies and actions that  increasingly are in the interests of the whole planet.However  no institution apart from the UnitedNations has the vocation or the capacity to respond tothose needs  since  to a large extent  it is the architect ofthe international stage on which we are players today.Under the auspices of the United Nations many resultshave been achieved in the search for solutions to theproblems that afflict humankind. Spectacular progress hasallowed human beings to take giant steps in science andtechnology. Nevertheless  there are still huge challenges toovercome  so that the ideals of the founders of the UnitedNations may triumph all over the face of the Earth.In reality  for many people peace is still a dream  andpromises of the distribution of the dividends from the endof the cold war have become an illusion. Malnutrition disease  illiteracy — the eternal partners ofunderdevelopment — still overpower nations  preventingthem from developing to their full potential to the benefitof their populations. Similarly  in many countries humanrights are flagrantly violated  women are marginalized  andchildren fall victim to maltreatment and exploitation. Inother countries  ethnic groups are subject to persecution andsystematic “cleansing”.At the same time  situations of tension  such as armsand drug trafficking  the internationalization of organizedcrime and an upsurge in terrorism  are becominggeneralized.But it is necessary to bear in mind that suchphenomena  both because of their origin and impact  can befought efficiently only if there is a firm  unequivocalcommitment by all States to improve internationalcooperation and better utilize resources within theframework of the United Nations.Cape Verde  due to its proximity to the Sahara desert is particularly affected by ecological problems  since  likeother countries of the Sahel  it faces continuousenvironmental degradation  which threatens the verysurvival of its population.It is therefore natural for us to welcome with joy theadoption and entry into force of the United NationsConvention to Combat Desertification in Those CountriesExperiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification Particularly in Africa  in particular its RegionalImplementation Annex for Africa. The particular attentionpaid to Africa is clearly justified. This continent is  withoutthe shadow of a doubt  the most affected by drought andthe most threatened by the advance of desertification. Theecological balance of the African continent  one fourth ofthe area of the planet  is crucial to stabilize the environmentas a whole.For that reason  the efforts that need to be made toprevent the desert from spreading must be shared by theentire international community.Cape Verde is therefore committed  together withother countries  to establishing an international mechanismwith the aim of facilitating the implementation andfinancing of the projects and programmes of theaforementioned Convention. We stress the praiseworthyaction  at the subregional level  of the Permanent Inter-State Committee on Drought Control in the Sahel incoordinating efforts to fight drought and desertification.I should also like to underline the significant effortsmade in this area at the national level in Cape Verde. Thereforestation programme launched in the first years of mycountry’s independence continues with the same vigour20 years later  and the results achieved are encouraging.Since the programme was launched  the area covered hasgone from 7 413 to nearly 181 275 acres. I must alsohighlight the major support given by Cape Verde’sdevelopment partners  without which it would not bepossible to maintain the reforestation programme at itscurrent pace  which is satisfactory to all.In spite of the success of this programme and of theefforts made  my country is still affected by thedevastating consequences of drought. In fact  due to thelack of rainfall in July and the insufficient rain lastAugust and September  Cape Verde faces a year of cropfailure  which  once again  has given rise to anxiety anddistress among Cape Verde’s farmers.Therefore  my Government will be forced  onceagain  to make an unexpected effort to address theconsequences of such a situation  which  of course  willhave a negative impact on the development process.We therefore urge international solidarity with thepeople and Government of Cape Verde to help ourcountry overcome the current farming crisis and ensureemployment in the rural areas.The world is seeing the gap widen betweenindustrialized countries and developing countries.Economic globalization and the development ofinformation and communications technology highlightexisting differences. Restrictive immigration policies which are associated with the spread of racism andxenophobia  are gathering speed day by day  which isdisturbing to us.2Meanwhile  developing countries and  in particular  theleast developed  face the consequences of acceleratedpopulation growth  which has direct repercussions onunemployment.The pursuit of full employment should be the toppriority of social and economic policies aimed at bringingabout development in order to provide all — men andwomen — with the chance to ensure that their means ofsubsistence are secure and long-lasting. Unfortunately  theinternational community is still reluctant to assume itsresponsibilities in such matters.A heavy burden thus falls upon the developingcountries — the task of recovering from the delaysresulting from an economic order that has not been  andstill is not  in their favour.This burden is even heavier in view of the inexorabletrend towards the reduction of financial flows to the leastdeveloped countries  both in official development assistanceand foreign direct investment.In this regard  the Agenda for Development  aimed atsupporting those countries in their efforts for recovery should make urgent demands with regard to internationalcooperation for development. It should  at the same time reaffirm the right to development as a main concern of theinternational community. The Agenda for Developmentcannot be seen as a mere enunciation of principles  butshould be taken as a true charter of social and economicgoals  with the United Nations playing a key role in itspromotion and materialization.In order to prepare the United Nations for thechallenges facing humankind as we approach the end of thecentury  we are committed to improving of the Organizationby promoting and undertaking reforms with the aim ofstrengthening it and empowering it so that it is better ableto fulfil the objectives of its Charter. There have been longand complex negotiations on the reform and restructuringof the United Nations system. This exercise has beencharacterized by its particular intensity and richness  aimedat adapting the institutions of our Organization to the newchallenges that face humankind as we approach the end ofthe century.But we are close to the time when decisions of theutmost importance to the future of the United Nations willhave to be taken. They will have to correspond  with duebalance  to the concerns of large and small countries. Whatwill certainly not be acceptable is a situation in whichreforms end up maintaining the differences that alreadyexist today. We support the idea that reforms shouldreflect the deep changes that have taken place in the 50years since the creation of the United Nations. There mustbe fair representation for all regions of the world in thedecision-making bodies of the United Nations  particularlyin the Security Council. In this regard  we recognize theneed for Africa to be duly represented  namely withAfrican countries as permanent members of the Council.We have all witnessed the successes  howeverrelative  of the difficult talks on nuclear disarmament  inparticular the indefinite extension of the Treaty on theNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  and the veryrecent adoption by the General Assembly of theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty  which I had thehonour and pleasure to sign on behalf of my country on2 October 1996. We believe that these two documentsprovide a historic opportunity and a powerful impetus forthe creation of conditions that will allow us to look withhope to the possibility  one day  of a world free of allnuclear weapons and of the nightmare of their use. Theprocess of nuclear disarmament should  from now on gain greater attention and follow-up.The signature in Cairo  on 11 April  of the PelindabaTreaty  which is the conclusion of joint efforts made bythe Organization of African Unity and the United Nations marked the solemn pledge of the Governments andpeoples of Africa to assume their share of the task ofridding the continent and the planet of nuclear weapons in the same way as did the Governments of LatinAmerica and the Caribbean in 1967  and those of theSouth Pacific in 1985.Cape Verde  which has consistently supported allefforts aimed at banning weapons of mass destruction cannot but congratulate itself on the strengthening ofinternational stability and security.Expectations were therefore raised in respect of theplanned fourth special session of the General Assemblydevoted to disarmament. We note that its mandate will bedefined in the course of this session. We hope the specialsession will become a landmark in the creation of anatmosphere of relief and trust that will help us to reachthe goal of eliminating weapons of mass destruction andreducing conventional armaments.A combination of historical  political  economic andclimatic factors  among others  have given Africa thelowest level of development of any continent over the3past three decades. Social and economic indicators are stillnegative  as are Africa’s prospects for the future.Approximately 50 per cent of the population of ourcontinent lives in a state of absolute poverty and thatpercentage will surely increase if quick and efficientsolutions are not found to resolve this crisis. At the sametime  as cause and consequence of this appalling scenario we have witnessed a succession of bloody conflicts bringing even greater poverty  disease and the degradationor even destruction of the environment.For this reason  so many important resources andcapabilities that are essential to assessing and resolving thecomplex issues of development are being wasted and  veryoften  forever lost on the battlefields.But it is not only the countries directly involved insuch conflicts that suffer the consequences. The tensionbrought about by the presence of armed groups across theborders of other States  the tragedy of refugees anddisplaced persons seeking shelter in neighbouring countriesand very often the consequent destruction of theenvironment  the spread of disease  the degeneration ofmoral values  the horror of suffering and behaviours farremoved from human values are all situations not confinedto the territorial limits of the States where conflicts occur.It is therefore with deep sorrow that we witness thenever-ending armed conflicts on our continent  despite theefforts of both the African and the internationalcommunities to put an end to them. Even when the partiesinvolved seem to have reached an agreement for the re-establishment of peace  there are unjustified reversals thatjeopardize the entire process.An example of this is the conflict that still exists inAngola  a country with which Cape Verde has deep ties notonly of history and culture  but also of solidarity. Wesupport the efforts of the Angolan Government and theinternational community to undertake all tasks aimed atbringing about a lasting peace  social stability and thenormal functioning of institutions at the national level without which the Angolan people will be unable to enjoythe tranquillity they rightfully deserve and the wealth theycould and should benefit from  given the huge potential oftheir country.The need for joint action to end the nightmare of warin several regions of the African continent is becomingmore and more urgent. The creation of the OAUMechanism for Conflict Prevention  Management andResolution was a far-sighted decision giving our continentthe autonomous ability to help resolve situations ofviolence and tension.Nevertheless  it is important to stress that  in keepingwith the principles that are at the foundation of thatMechanism  its main aim is anticipation and prevention ofconflicts. Peacekeeping and security in the world remainthe primary responsibility of the United Nations SecurityCouncil  though there may be a justification in somesituations for the involvement of the OAU in specificpeacekeeping and observer missions.Addressing the causes of the conflicts  however remains the most important issue. These causes are to befound essentially in the conditions of underdevelopmentthat persist in most of our countries. Such conditionsnurture the seeds of violence and intolerance  are at theroot of armed conflicts and block the establishment ofstructures to ensure democratic participation and itsresulting human rights benefits. Key elements for theattainment of peace in Africa are therefore the promotionof lasting development  investment in human resourcesand ensuring that current processes of democratization aresuccessful and widespread. It is imperative that suchprocesses be duly supported so that they can consolidateand improve the living conditions of the population andstand up to possible coups de force or other such threats.The promotion and use of dialogue must be employed toresolve situations of civil strife and armed conflict.In the light of the dimension and scale of theproblem of development in Africa and questions ofsecurity  we agree with the argument that Africa iscurrently the major challenge facing the United Nations.Development  security and peace are major concerns inthe minds of the leaders of the continent and of all othersinterested in the future of Africa. These goals areinterrelated and cannot be achieved separately.Of all the factors limiting the achievement of suchobjectives  the reduction of poverty is undoubtedly theone that must first be overcome through a strategy ofsustainable development. Without this  the remainingeconomic and social goals cannot be achieved. Thepersistence of poverty is a constant threat not only toeconomic development  but also to the political and socialstability of States and to the preservation of theenvironment.Another fact to bear in mind is that solutions for theproblems of development in Africa should be designedand managed on our own continent  thus making4responsibility for Africa dependent on the development ofthe countries thereof. In this context  Africa is currentlydeeply committed to the search for internal and lastingsolutions to its problems  which in no way suggests arejection of the technological and financial resources andcontributions that we believe the international communityshould continue to make available so that we can overcomethe major difficulties we still face.African countries are fully aware that they must taketheir destiny into their own hands and have been trying toimplement measures that reflect their seriousness and henceworthiness to receive support in order to produce theexpected results.Several African countries have been undertakinginstitutional reforms with the aim of opening up theirmarkets  reducing the role of the State in the economy andstrengthening the private sector in order to make it credibleand able to generate employment. Such reforms  combinedwith democracy and the development of civil society  tendto promote social and economic stability  therebymarshalling internal resources and encouraging foreigninvestment.In this context  we must stress the importance ofinitiatives to promote greater foreign private investment  asource of employment and added value which isfundamental to ensuring the continuous and stable growthof African economies.Another important initiative in which Africa isengaged is the African Economic Community  whichreceived a decisive boost in May 1994 when the AbujaTreaty entered into force. As a first step in itsimplementation  the African countries are engaged instrengthening the regional integration of their economiesthrough regional economic communities.Last year  the Organization of African Unity adoptedthe Cairo Plan of Action to give new impetus to theeconomic and social development of Africa. Itsobjectives — responsible management  food security development of human resources  the proper and effectiveuse of natural resources  cooperation and economic regionalintegration — are ambitious but feasible. They depend uponthe political will of Governments and their ability tomarshal the internal means and external support to achievethese objectives. Mention should be made in this regard tothe principles set out in the important decisions adopted orbeing prepared by the United Nations: the United NationsNew Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990sand the Agenda for Development.The Cairo Plan of Action also recalls the need forthe adoption of measures limiting the negative impact ofthe Uruguay Round agreements on the development ofAfrica in general and of the least developed countries inparticular  and urges creditors to be prepared to assist infinding ways to reduce the debt burden  particularly asregards the current levels of debt servicing.The recent mid-term review of the United NationsNew Agenda was an opportunity for the internationalcommunity to renew its commitment to measures aimedat adding new impetus to implementation  particularly asregards external debt  the diversification of Africaneconomies  greater access to markets and the transfer oftechnology. Africa sincerely hopes that that commitment freely entered into by its partners  will be promptlyfulfilled.Although the current situation tends to raise veryserious concerns  it is nonetheless possible to findencouraging signs pointing to positive developments inthe situation on the African continent from the point ofview of economic growth and the consolidation ofdemocracy. And these are more than mere signs; someexamples of clear successes already visible in Africa inrecent years show that it is not heading exclusivelytowards chaos and destruction. It is necessary to findappropriate policies to manage these positive signs policies which we must be courageous enough toimplement. We are certain such actions will achieveresults.Although the signs are positive  they still do notreflect an irreversible trend. The burden of dependencyresulting from past policies is still too heavy for Africa toreverse the situation on its own. Now more than ever  theinternational community  specialized agencies and theindustrialized countries that are friends of Africa arecalled upon to strengthen financial and technicalassistance to the continent so that underdevelopment canbe definitively overcome.In this regard  we congratulate certain countries ontheir willingness to maintain their levels of cooperationwith Africa. Cape Verde is also pleased to note the effortsand generosity of certain partners  including some fromthe South  on behalf of the development of our country.5Cape Verde does not expect to be solely a beneficiaryof the actions and initiatives of the United Nations. Despiteits limitations and the fragility of its economy  my countrywishes to contribute to the search for solutions to problemsdemanding our attention and to participate in those actionsin which our presence is necessary.Despite its brief history as an independent country Cape Verde has several times had an opportunity to play apositive role in processes involving other countries  eithercontributing to the dialogue and understanding between theparties involved or through participation in United Nationspeacekeeping operations.It is the understanding of the Government of CapeVerde that  despite the structural difficulties it faces  it isduty-bound to contribute to the creation of a peacefulinternational environment and a partnership of solidaritythat will allow all the nations of the world to benefit frommankind’s scientific and technical achievements and toimprove social management in order to guarantee eachcitizen internationally recognized basic rights associatedwith the values of freedom  democracy  development andwell-being.In this regard  we must recall here the suffering of thepeople of East Timor  deprived of the right to exercise self-determination and subjugated to a foreign militaryoccupation for over 20 years. We note with admiration theresilience of the courageous Maubère people  who have lostso many of their sons to the cause of freedom. In thisforum  where so much has been done to support the rightof colonial peoples to decide their own destinies  we joinour voice to those demanding the restitution of legality inthat territory and that the Timorese people be given the fullexercise of their rights  including the right to self-determination.In this same context  we cannot remain indifferent tothe recent events in the Middle East. They show clearly thatthere is no alternative to the peace process and thatdialogue  tolerance and common sense must prevail overforce  violence and intolerance  failing which the regioncould well be plunged anew into chaos and destruction thus delaying once again the hope of its peoples to live inpeace and security.The eyes and hopes of mankind are turned to theUnited Nations. We are convinced that our Organizationwill emerge from this session with renewed strength andwith new actions and initiatives that will enable us to lookconfidently to the challenges that the dawn of the thirdmillennium holds for all Governments and peoples of theworld."
"39",1656,"CRI",51,1996,"﻿The delegation of Costa Rica is pleased toextend its warmest congratulations to the President of theGeneral Assembly on his election. In addition to hisdistinguished personal and professional qualities  we areinspired by the respect and friendship that we share withMalaysia  a living example of many peoples joining theirefforts without losing their identity  as is appropriatelystated in the motto of Malaysia: Unity is strength.I am also pleased to convey Costa Rica’s respects tothe former President of the General Assembly  HisExcellency Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral  for his excellentwork presiding over the deliberations of the Assembly.Mr. Secretary-General  your work in favour of worldpeace and security and your efforts to renew the UnitedNations have granted you a place of honour in the pages ofthe history of this Organization and of the internationalcommunity. My delegation wishes to convey the gratitudeand respect Costa Rica feels for your commendable work.A session of the General Assembly is necessarily atime for meditation for all Member States. Each and everydelegation asks itself the same questions: what progress hasbeen made towards fulfilling the purposes and principles ofthe United Nations during the last 12 months? What has ourcountry or region done to contribute to that task? Is theUnited Nations playing the role we would like it to? Whatcan we do to ensure that this Organization lives up to thehopes placed in it? What progress have we achieved in thereform of the United Nations?We are keenly aware that in this post-cold-war era theUnited Nations agenda has grown considerably.Nevertheless  the present situation does not seem veryencouraging. The establishment of this Organization  as wewere reminded during the celebration of its fiftiethanniversary  was one of the most extraordinaryconsequences of the end of the Second World War.However  the so-called balance of terror between the super-Powers that prevailed in the cold-war years has beenfollowed by a long series of conflicts that  despite theirlimited geographical scope  are nonetheless damaging andbloody. We have watched in anguish as  in several parts ofthe world  national  religious  tribal and racial hatredshave re-emerged. Even within pluralistic democracies situations of extreme poverty and social injustice in someinstances  or of crime and drug trafficking in others  haveunleashed varying degrees of violence. To all this wemust add the recent events of recent weeks in the MiddleEast  which have given rise to deep concern and mayhave grave consequences for the maintenance ofinternational peace and security.Nonetheless  there are grounds for optimism. Wehope that the elections in Bosnia  which took place in aharmonious environment  will allow for the establishmentof a durable multi-ethnic State  in the spirit of the peaceagreements.In the same vein  my delegation welcomes theresumption of negotiations between the State of Israel andthe Palestinian Authority aimed at achieving harmoniousrelations among the peoples inhabiting the Holy Land. Iam pleased to inform the General Assembly that aplenipotentiary envoy from Costa Rica met recently withChairman Arafat to convey to him Costa Rica’s solidaritywith the Palestinian people and its steadfast determinationto support and contribute to compliance with the Osloagreements in order to achieve a stable and lasting peacein the Middle East.Costa Rica  which will soon celebrate the fiftiethanniversary of the abolition of its armed forces  alsowelcomed the Advisory Opinion of the InternationalCourt of Justice regarding the legality of the use andthreat of use of nuclear weapons  and it is deeply satisfiedby the opening for signature of the ComprehensiveNuclear Test-Ban Treaty. Since 1958  in the frameworkof the Organization of American States  my country hasbeen proposing the limitation of conventional weaponsand the prohibition of nuclear weapons within the inter-American system. In keeping with this civil and pacifistinclination  Costa Rica signed the Treaty at the GeneralAssembly. My delegation further calls fraternally upon allMember States of the United Nations to do likewise assoon as possible. Similarly  my nation considers mostfavourably the draft resolution proposed by Malaysiaregarding the follow-up to the Advisory Opinion and itscall for the start of negotiations to conclude a treatyproviding for global nuclear disarmament.We are also of the view that greater considerationneeds to be given to the problems raised by internationalarms transfers and trade. The delegation of Costa Ricawould like to take this opportunity to recall the draft23international code of conduct on this issue  proposed by theformer President of Costa Rica  Oscar Arias  and otherNobel Prize laureates  in accordance with the principles ofthe United Nations and with the aspiration of maintainingworld peace.Costa Rica is also pleased to say that Central Americahas continued its progress in consolidating peace anddemocracy. Although we still suffer serious problems andstill face harsh social and economic realities  the bloodycrisis of the 1980s belongs to the past. The CentralAmerican countries are firmly committed to consolidatingpeace and maintaining democracy. Honest and pluralisticelectoral processes have become the norm where beforethey were the exception. National reconciliation isbecoming a reality. The recent  definitive progress in theGuatemalan peace process augurs well for the definitiveattainment of peace in the entire Central American area. Inthis regard  I am pleased to extend special congratulationsto the Government of President Alvaro Arzú Irigoyen  tothe Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca (URNG) to the Group of Friends  particularly the Government ofMexico and President Ernesto Zedillo  and to the Secretariatof the United Nations  for the progress recently achieved.The existence of peace and democracy in CentralAmerica  a region usually considered turbulent  proves thatwill and perseverance can overcome any of the negativelegacies of history. We  the Central American peoples  hopethat other peoples will join in this experience  withouthaving to pay so high a price. Nonetheless  preciselybecause all the countries in the region were affected  in oneway or another  by this political and security crisis  all ofus are now working determinedly to ensure that that chapterwill not be reopened.We know  furthermore  that without development therewill be no lasting peace. With this conviction  the CentralAmerican region has found a common goal in theendeavour to attain sustainable political  economic  socialcultural and environmental development.Two years ago  the Central American nations decidedto unite in an Alliance for Sustainable Development. Inaddition to reconciling humankind with nature  this Allianceaspires to establish in our countries a society that will allowpresent generations to fully develop their capabilities in allareas and that will ensure future generations a prosperousfuture.Our Alliance is based on a common political projectthat combines economic growth  environmental balance andindividual freedom. For the first time in its long history Central America has a common developmental goal  andthis in turn strengthens its dedication to regionalism.In the same line of action  Central America has setout on a quest for innovative approaches to the rest of theworld that will help it realize its political  social economic  cultural and environmental goals. This jointfraternal action aimed at reincorporating Central Americainto the international community has sought toinstitutionalize new links with other countries and regionsthat have supported our efforts to attain peace anddemocracy in the isthmus  and that are now cooperatingin our struggle for sustainable development. CentralAmerica has thus established special mechanisms ofdialogue and cooperation with Mexico  Chile  Canada  theUnited States of America  Japan  the Republic of Koreaand the Republic of China on Taiwan. We have alsoredefined our relations with the European Union institutionalized since the start of the last decade in whatis known as the San José dialogue. We hope that in thenear future these activities will be extended to othercountries and regions.The conviction that it is possible to consolidatepeace only through development is not exclusive toCentral America. This year my country has had thehonour and the privilege to preside over the Group of 77and China in New York. This has allowed us to representand defend on numerous occasions the points of view ofthe countries of Africa  Asia  Latin America and theCaribbean.One fifth of humanity continues to live in conditionsof extreme poverty; discrimination on the basis of gendercontinues to be the order of the day; millions of childrencontinue to lack access to education  health services andnutrition. My delegation views these facts with deepregret and attaches the utmost importance to the Agendafor Development.In this connection  I wish to reiterate the convictionexpressed recently on the occasion of the adoption of thereport of the Working Group on this matter — that thatforum must remain open. A true United Nations systemis inconceivable without an integrated and comprehensiveplan of action for development. If the issues ofdevelopment and international cooperation were to bereduced or diminished in this Organization  the veryessence of the United Nations would be seriouslyaffected.24In that same spirit of solidarity that holds sway in ourOrganization  we believe that the preservation andstrengthening of the United Nations Conference on Tradeand Development (UNCTAD) and the United NationsInternational Development Organization (UNIDO) areessential. For small countries in particular  the linkagebetween commerce  technology transfer and developmentare  in and of themselves  outside the framework of theWorld Trade Organization. In order to emphasize this firmconviction  the President of Costa Rica travelled to SouthAfrica on the occasion of UNCTAD’s 9th meeting. At thatforum he expressed our country’s support for the just andlegitimate aspirations to development of the countries of thethird world.International cooperation cannot be viewed solely interms of the richest giving aid to the poorest. We stronglybelieve in the necessity and appropriateness of intensifyingthe efforts aimed at increasing horizontal cooperationbetween developing countries. In January 1997  at theconclusion of its term as Chairman of the Group of 77 andChina  Costa Rica will convene — with the participation ofthe private sector and non-governmental organizations — aSouth-South conference on trade  finance and investment.We hope that new and constructive approaches to speed upthe rate of economic and financial cooperation amongdeveloping countries will result from that conference.Directly related to the subject of the Agenda forDevelopment is the need for an integrated follow-up to theagreements and programmes of action adopted at thesummits and conferences held by the United Nations in thelast decade. In them lies the real agenda of work for theUnited Nations in such essential fields as the environment population  human rights  the rights of women and children habitat and social development. Accordingly  Costa Rica  inits capacity as Chairman of the Group of 77 and China promoted and received unanimous support in the Economicand Social Council for a resolution designed to givecoherence and provide follow-up to the agreements andprogrammes of action of the international conferences andsummits of the United Nations.Costa Rica  as an agricultural country  attaches greatimportance to the food summit planned to be held at Romeat the end of this year. As early as 1954  through theinitiative of then-President José Figueres Ferrer  Costa Ricaproposed to this Organization the creation of a world foodreserve that would enable us to confront the effects ofnatural disasters and famines. Today we still believe thatinternational solidarity is decisive in facing food challengesand that it constitutes a fundamental goal of contemporaryinternational relations that should not be disregarded inthe search for economic liberalization.Of greatest importance  and closely related to theseissues  is the need to pay attention to the problems ofdesertification and water resources  which during the earlyyears of the next millennium will gravely affect foodproduction and the very existence of the human species.At the World Summit for Social Development  itwas reaffirmed that human rights are universal indivisible  interdependent and interrelated. Among thoserights is the global right to development  which  in CostaRica’s opinion  right cannot be reduced to its mereeconomic dimension. Development must also have amoral and ethical dimension. We must accept theresponsibility of ensuring that the world that we are goingto leave to future generations is going to be morepeaceful  healthier  more humane and more democraticthan the one in which we have lived. This responsibilitymust be shared individually and collectively  nationallyand internationally by all elements of society.Reflection on what we have done and what we havefailed to do over the last 12 months leads us to thequestion of what must be done in the immediate future.In this connection  the revitalization and reform of theUnited Nations system is pivotal. In its analysis of thisissue  the Government of Costa Rica has considered withdeep interest some of the proposals contained in thereport of the Commission on Global Governance. Thereform of the United Nations must reflect the realities ofchange  including the capacity of civil society tocontribute to global governance.My delegation attaches fundamental importance tothe restructuring of the Security Council. We cannotarrive at the year 2000 still using the calendar of 1945.The Council cannot continue to be held in a frameworkthat has been fully overtaken by the reality ofinternational politics. Costa Rica considers it a priority totake up this task  both in order to grant permanentmembership to Germany and Japan and to arepresentative of each of the three developing regions —Africa  Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean. Inaddition  we must reorganize the powers of the Counciland of its members. If the political conditions for areform of this kind do not exist  we must then considerother possibilities  such as the proposal made by theGovernment of Italy.25We consider that there is a need to infuse the GeneralAssembly with new vitality  as regards both the need toensure the principle of universality and the modernizationof its agenda and procedures. We believe that no people onEarth should be denied the right to be represented in ourOrganization.My delegation is also of the view that greaterimportance should be given to the work of the Council andthe Secretariat in the area of preventive diplomacy. Theactions of these bodies at the outset of a conflict can bedecisive in achieving a solution  but they would be evenmore so if their powers were increased so that they couldanticipate such situations. Similarly  we believe that thereis a need to restructure the Secretariat to give it greaterflexibility and effectiveness in the execution of its tasks.As a country that entrusts its security to internationallaw  Costa Rica gives a place of honour to the InternationalCourt of Justice. In our opinion  the acceptance of thecompulsory jurisdiction of the Court could become a dutyinherent in membership of this Organization.Finally  the restructuring of the United Nations is alsodirectly linked to its financial capabilities. The new UnitedNations cannot be the property of the major Powers  norcan it become the sole responsibility of a small group ofStates. The United Nations of the future should belong toall  and this conception logically involves the duty of all itsMembers to meet their commitments in accordance with thescale of assessments. In this respect  my delegation believesthat the full reform of the United Nations system  if itensures a more rational administration and more equitabledistribution of the resources and programmes of theOrganization  will put the Organization in a better positionto insist that its Members States pay their assessments ontime.Our world is approaching the third millennium. In themidst of so much darkness  so many challenges and somany overwhelming difficulties  the human race retains aspirit that  together with the use of language  distinguishesit from any other species: hope. This spirit  now more thanever before  is embodied in this Organization. The UnitedNations must remain united in its effort to make the presentbetter and united in its goal to design a promising future.I should like to conclude by recalling a teaching of theProphet Mohammed which continues to resonate today asa norm of conduct for all human beings and all nations onEarth:“Do not break the ties of friendship  do not feelbitterness towards your fellow men  do not feelloathing for them  do not envy them. Live asbrothers  as God has ordered us to do.”"
"40",1725,"CUB",51,1996,"﻿A year ago  from this same rostrum  I began mystatement by reading some 10 hair-raising news items ofthe moment from the international press  on bellicoseconflicts  violence and death in the cities and deadlyepidemics claiming new victims. Intending to do this againtoday  I found that the situation remains the same  or isperhaps even worse. Unfortunately  the world wastedanother 12 months without doing anything to stop suchcatastrophic events.As if it were necessary to illustrate this with specificfacts  even as we gathered here we once again witnessedthe bloodshed of the heroic Palestinian people. First andforemost  I denounce the new Israeli aggression and thepolicy of hegemony that defends these acts  and I expresssupport for our Palestinian brothers in their struggle fortheir legitimate right to finally have an independent state with Jerusalem its capital.Also about a year ago  the Prime Minister ofMalaysia  the country of the President of the GeneralAssembly  very rightly stated that the United Nationsshould support the collective needs of peoples and nationsin order to serve humanity as a whole  and that it wastherefore necessary to correct the trend of making them aninstrument of the wealthy and the powerful. Today it mustbe recognized that we are meeting again without havingremoved that danger.Hence  in expressing my Government’s satisfaction athaving President Razali lead us in our work  I cannot butexpress confidence that his diplomatic professionalism  hispersonal achievements and his long and proven experiencein the work of this Organization will give him strength inleading us in a remarkably difficult and complex session ofthe General Assembly.Far from being more democratic and universal  theOrganization in which we come together today is tendingto tighten more and more the exclusive circle of those whogovern it. The just demands heard from this rostrum arenow sounding the alarm at the march of ideas beingpromoted mainly in our host country.Just a few weeks ago  the Chairman of the UnitedStates Senate Foreign Relations Committee issued anultimatum for the United Nations to carry out reforms inaccordance with the prescriptions of that country or elseface the consequences. His articles in renownedpublications question precisely the principles on which thisinstitution is founded  particularly the principle ofsovereign equality of States.For this influential United States politician and thosewho identify themselves with his primitive views  there isonly one argument: some States deserve more privilegesthan others. In this way they try to make a dead letter ofthe principle of sovereign equality of States  thecornerstone of the Charter adopted over 50 years ago inSan Francisco.But there is more: the Government of the UnitedStates of America  which owes the United Nations theshameful amount of over $1.5 billion  assumes  with noembarrassment whatsoever  the right to determineunilaterally who can or cannot be the Secretary-Generalof the United Nations and to declare how an Organizationdeliberately deprived of the resources required for thefulfilment of its functions should or should not bemanaged.Eighty per cent of the work of the United Nationssystem is devoted to assisting the developing countriesand to strengthening their ability to help themselves. Thisendeavour includes the aspiration to receive fair treatmentin international economic relations; to try to save childrenfrom starvation and disease; to promote emergencyassistance to refugees and disaster victims; to attempt tocombat crime  drug addiction and disease; to promoteeducation and the development of human resources; andto tackle the enormous task of halting or slowing theprogressive ecological deterioration of our planet.These are precisely the functions that the notoriousUnited States Senator is trying to abolish  and it isbecause of the existence of those programmes that themanagerial approach of the Secretary-General is sofiercely attacked.That position of the planet’s most powerful countryis not aimed against one person; rather  using the questionof the Organization’s efficiency as a pretext  it standsagainst the United Nations mandate to attend to the needsof the great majority of mankind. It is a new and grossattempt to impose on the community of nations the willof a single State in the management of the multilateralforum of cooperation that should be the mostrepresentative and democratic one in the world.We should ask ourselves if we  the members of thisAssembly  can passively accept the threat posed by thisunilateral imposition. It is fitting to recall what Harry24Truman said of the Charter of the United Nations at theSan Francisco Conference in 1945:“If we fail to use it  we shall betray all thosewho have died in order that we might meet here infreedom and safety to create it.“If we seek to use it selfishly — for theadvantage of any one nation or any small group ofnations — we shall be equally guilty of that betrayal.”(Documents of the United Nations Conference onInternational Organization  San Francisco  1945 vol. 1  p. 687)Further comment is unnecessary; subsequent historyhas been quite eloquent enough. But the most dangerousthing  as has often been said  is that the United Nations ismerely the reflection of the world in which we live. Thisdomineering unilateralism shows up even more crudely inthe daily conduct of international relations. In a world inwhich relations of respect  good-neighbourliness andcooperation among the peoples and Governments should befostered every day  the fact is that one Power  resting on itsunquestionable economic  military and technological might seeks to impose rules and norms of conduct on the rest ofthe world  thus undermining the sovereign rights of eachand every one of our nations.What political  legal or moral reason underlies andlegitimizes the missile attack against the Republic of Iraqby the United States Armed Forces just a few days ago?What principles or claims can be used to cover up theunilateral and unjustified use of force? The SecurityCouncil did not yield to that unilateral aggression  but it hasnot been able to formulate a clear position on the matterbecause of its well-known structural and proceduraldeficiencies and also because of the tolerance and impunitywith which the international community has recentlyaccepted the haughty arrogance of a Government thatassumes the right to punish sovereign nations at its whimunder spurious pretexts.There is no justification for trampling the territorialintegrity of a full-fledged Member of this Organization  andeven less for that action to be taken by a singleGovernment  nor for threatening the peace and security ofa region inhabited by tens of millions of persons. And allthis has taken place while the political experts of theaggressor country could not agree on which was itsstrongest motivation: the wretched oil interests or the frenzyof the ongoing carnival-like electoral campaign in theUnited States.It is incredible that world politics can be paralysed that foreign ministries postpone decisions and thatGovernments advance or delay responses to national orinternational dilemmas  thinking only of theirrepercussions in that North American simulacrum ofdemocracy. Anything can happen  and no country  legalprecept or moral principle seems to be safe. Fortunately the super-elections are held only every four years because if they took place annually  like the sessions ofthe General Assembly  living on this planet would be truemadness.The Helms-Burton Act  aimed against everyone’ssovereignty and against Cuba  a sovereign State  wasconceived as an additional effort to subdue our peoplethrough hunger and poverty. It is an eloquent example ofthe absurd will to impose imperial designs on sovereignand independent countries in the conduct of their owninternational and trade relations. For that reason  it hasbeen unanimously rejected by the internationalcommunity. That law  ignoring the General Assemblyresolutions on the issue  is intended to strengthen furtherthe blockade against our country.For a century — and especially during the last 37years — the Cuban people have had to face thehegemonic vocation of successive United StatesGovernments. The extraterritorial ambitions of ourneighbour  its attempts to question the sovereign decisionsof another State and its violation of the universallyrecognized principles of international trade are realitieswith which Cuba has been familiar for a long time.When we denounced the crime that was about totake place  it was neither to frighten nor to play withanyone. The Helms-Burton Act  the most sophisticatedbungle of the economic war against Cuba  attacks manycountries and compels them to experience in their ownsovereignty what we Cubans have been facing for a longtime. The world can now better understand what so manyyears of continuous offences and extraterritorial acts havemeant for my homeland.Another instance of unipolarity and of the attempt todictate the conduct of sovereign States is the law knownas D’Amato-Kennedy  which has also received universalrepudiation. It repeats the philosophy of imposition andratifies the tendency to apply United States law beyond itsborders. The argument for this is the alleged war againstterrorism  when  in fact  the United States was the mainpromoter of terrorism in its dirty wars in Nicaragua  ElSalvador  Angola and South Africa  against the25Palestinian patriots and in many other countries — theUnited States has always supported the bloodiest regimesthat have ever existed in this world.There are just causes and unjust causes. No one willever have the right to kill innocent people  regardless of theobjectives being pursued. This does not negate any people’sright to use weapons against its oppressors: to fight cleanly yes; to kill innocents  never. A State cannot be allowed toarrogate to itself the right to accuse  condemn and sanctionother nations and to impose by force an illegitimate crusadethat often serves to disguise the real terrorists.Cuba — which has been the victim of many terroristactions and has for many years faced repeated attempts onthe lives of its political leaders  as well as sabotage biological warfare  the destruction of a passenger plane inflight and the hijacking of aircraft  and which suffers eventoday from armed infiltrations and which has been  aboveall  the victim of brutal economic terrorism — expects ajoint and conscious effort from the international communityto address the terrorism that has its origins in Langley Virginia — that is to say  at the Central IntelligenceAgency — and later spreads to many countries of theworld.Drug trafficking  in our opinion  should be dealt within the same manner. The drug issue should not betransformed into an instrument of pressure againstunderdeveloped countries  many of which do not havesufficient resources to tackle this scourge. This problem hastaken on global dimensions and can be confronted only bysharing responsibilities and using the mechanisms offeredby the United Nations.The policy of conferring arbitrary certifications isunacceptable  and even more so is its use as a pretext tointerfere in the internal affairs of sovereign nations. Thecountry whose enormous rates of consumption have becomethe main market for and driving force behind this criminalindustry  the country in whose territory the greatest profitsof this business are generated  does not have the moralauthority to assign responsibility to or demand it fromothers. What would happen if the world  truly concerned bythe scourge of drugs  were to decertify unanimously thegreatest drug consumer? To put it another way  people wholive in glass houses should not throw stones  and he whohas a beam in his eye should not be so concerned about themote in another’s.No one can disregard the immense influence of theUnited States in the so-called post-cold-war period  butmankind would be making a mistake if it were to lookwith indifference upon the currents of thought within thatcountry that entertain the possibility of governing the restof the world or of acting with utter disregard for therights and interests of other peoples. We are facing aKing Kong escaped from his cage  destroying andcrushing everything around him  aimlessly and out ofcontrol.We are not trying to convince this forum that theUnited States is the source of all the evils of the planet but it would be a mistake to ignore reality and not to taketimely preventive actions — preferably collective ones —to admonish to sanity the persons charged with guidingthat country politically  to do so with a minimum ofresponsibility and to understand that the power of anynation  important as it might be  has its limits.The world is more plagued by uncertainty today thanwhen the new world order was demagogically proclaimed.On the threshold of the new millennium  the numbers ofarmed conflicts between States  ethnic groups andreligions have increased. What we see everywhere is nota new order but  rather  a disquieting world in perfectdisorder. The social and economic consequences of theseconflicts have no parallel in contemporary history  but wecannot simply pretend that military imposition  coercionand sanctions are a universal panacea that can solve thenumerous humanitarian problems of the world.Inequalities  rampant underdevelopment globalization and the interdependence that is increasinglyturning into the worst form of dependency shoulddisappear so that these new conflicts may  in turn  beeradicated for ever from this world  which  based oninjustice  is becoming increasingly ungovernable.Economic models based on neoliberal philosophyhave spread throughout much of the third world with thesupport of the international financial institutions. Althoughthese models have generated deceptive  apparentlyattractive macroeconomic indicators  in practice they gohand in hand with an increase in poverty  marginalization environmental degradation  disease  ignorance  socialconflict  a loss of national resources and sovereignty —in short  with the most brutal and increasingly irreversibleunderdevelopment.This neoliberal school of thought is based onartificial paradigms that should be unmasked. It is falsethat the market  with its magical invisible hand  is thedefinitive solution for the immense disruptions affectingthe international economy and that it is the miraculous26remedy that would liberate many countries  home to thevast majority of the earth’s population  fromunderdevelopment and poverty.It is false that absolute privatization  which can benefitonly the few  brings well-being to the legions of the poorand the wretched living in the third world.It is false that geography determines the economicpower of peoples.It is false that genetics determines which humanbeings are born to be poor and wretched and which areborn under the shining star of wealth and extravagance.It is false that the State or Government is the mainsource of corruption and inefficiency and should renounceresponsibility for welfare  health and education  leavingthese obligations mainly in private hands whose motivationswill always be limited and discriminatory and are frequentlybased on greed.It is false that the poor  the oppressed and theexploited should have a lesser role in ultra-modernsocieties.It is false that social justice and equity always have tobe sacrificed for the sake of commercial efficiency.It is false that the total removal of protection fornational industries in the developing countries will yieldhigher productivity  wealth  employment and well-being fortheir peoples.It is false that the sovereignty of nations is anoutmoded principle of international coexistence and thatGovernments and countries are ready to abandon it becauseof the strength of transnational capital and the social-political models exported by the North.Finally  it is false that the neoliberal models that havebeen sold to us will raise the indicators or levels of humandevelopment set as objectives by the United Nations.One should check the statistics and compare annualreports  not just between one country and another  but alsobetween indicators for the third world from one year to thenext in areas such as infant mortality  poverty  education life expectancy  access to drinking water  humansettlements  schooling for children  and doctors per numberof inhabitants.All these falsities  many of them recorded in UnitedNations documents  hide the bankruptcy of developmentprospects for most of the poor countries  which is alreadythreatening world stability and aggravating the ecologicaldeterioration we all recognized several years ago at thehistoric Rio Conference. The poor are already falling intothe immense and ever wider chasm separating them fromthe rich  who continue to grow disproportionately andirresponsibly without realizing that sooner or later theirown weight will also drag them down into the same pit.And  in this aberrant context  what are we to sayabout the arms race? The rivalry between the big Powersand the arms race have supposedly disappeared. Why then  in spite of the adoption of international instrumentssupposedly to that end  is there such resistance to realnuclear disarmament that will free humanity for ever fromthat scourge? Who is responsible for the fact that therecently adopted Treaty to ban all nuclear tests does notcover simulated laboratory tests in which new lethalweapons will be perfected by those who monopolizethem  or any commitment to the destruction of arsenals?Unless we discover life in other galaxies  where will theenemies endangering the big Powers come from?Fifty-one years after the creation of the UnitedNations  instead of seeing wealth and development extendfrom the North to the South  we see the growing threat ofunderdevelopment moving inexorably from the South tothe North.It is said that hunger and poverty are on the rise. Infact  what has also happened is that wealth is more andmore concentrated  increasingly exclusive and limited while walls higher than the one that fell in Berlin arebeing built.Let us be frank: the North is not as rich as it seems nor is the South as poor as they want to make it. Almostall the wealth of the North comes from the wealth andresources of the South. And all the hunger and poverty ofthe South is nothing other than the legacy of over 500years of exploitation and disregard for our human rights.If we cannot reverse this situation collectively  bysharing the burden and improving living conditions in thedeveloping countries  no one will be able to stop thewaves of migrants attracted by the siren’s song of wealthyand opulent societies.The United Nations has a vast arsenal of documents resolutions and initiatives conceived for those purposes27but never implemented. Soon it will be too late. Today wecan still act.While all this is happening  the blockade of Cubacontinues. With the Helms-Burton Act  it has become evenclearer that it is not just an embargo  because in the lastfew months  the United States  through its words and deeds has sent the world sure signals that what is really beingwaged against my country is a long and dirty economic warfor total control over our sovereignty and our markets.The criminal blockade  as part of its frighteningnetwork of measures created over 35 years  has now aDraconian law that publicly calls for a world crusade tochange forcibly the Cuban constitutional order and undo arevolution defended by our people at the cost of their lives.What have we come to when United States diplomats on the ugliest mission since the Viet Nam war  tell theworld that they are granting it a few months’ sovereigntybefore trampling upon it if the world does not join theirwar on Cuba?I am fulfilling the mandate bestowed on me by thefree people of Cuba to proclaim in front of theinternational community of nations that we will perseverein our efforts to defend our social  political and economicactions aimed at ensuring equality  justice and well-beingfor all Cubans.Our own experience is the best contribution we canmake as a nation towards meeting the enormouschallenges facing humanity  as has been shown by Cuba’seconomic  political and social achievements in the lastyear. A country that has overcome a serious economiccrisis  that maintains its governability  that grows anddevelops with the solidarity of many  that expands itsrelations throughout the world and that grows stronger —this is a country with a future.The socialism we have chosen for our homeland isour only emancipatory  moral and ethical alternative  withroots firmly planted in the history of our nation. It is apath that we chose in freedom and sovereignty  a paththat we shall not renounce and that no one imposed on us.We wish to live in harmony with all the countries ofthe world  including the United States. Cuba wants andneeds peace. But let us be clear: Cuba is not and neverwill be willing to sacrifice  under pressure from anyoneor in exchange for anything  the independence sovereignty and self-determination that it has achievedand defended at such a high price.Today  in that blue Caribbean that shelters us  weCubans will continue with our heads held high  with ourfeet on the ground and with our eyes on the future. Thusdo we defend our choice: to live in the free and sovereignhomeland dreamed of by our founding fathers andachieved by our fathers and grandfathers.Let there be no doubt. We shall overcome."
"41",1771,"CYP",51,1996,"﻿I would like to begin byextending to you  Sir  my warmest congratulations on yourelection as President of the General Assembly. We arecertain that your long experience  outstanding ability anddiplomatic skill will guide us successfully in our work atthis fifty-first session of the General Assembly. Allow mealso to thank your predecessor  Mr. Diogo Freitasdo Amaral  for his untiring efforts during the previoussession.At last year’s session  which marked the fiftiethanniversary of the United Nations  we reflected on the birthof the United Nations  assessed its development andinfluence on international relations to date  paid tribute toits achievements and identified some of its difficulties. Atthe same time  we acknowledged that our mainresponsibility for the future of the Organization is toinsure that it has the ability to address most effectivelythe agenda of the twenty-first century.In the Declaration on the Occasion of the FiftiethAnniversary of the United Nations  we agreed that“In order to be able to respond effectively tothe challenges of the future and the expectations ofthe United Nations held by peoples around theworld  it is essential that the United Nations itself bereformed and modernized.” (resolution 50/6 para. 14)Now  as we begin the fifty-first session of theGeneral Assembly  we should take stock of what we havebeen able to accomplish and redirect our efforts to whatremains to be achieved.In 1996  we have continued our work towards theinstitutional and financial reforms needed to make theUnited Nations a more productive and dynamic institutionso that it will be better able to perform its key functionsand fulfil its mandates more effectively. In this regard  thefundamental priority must be to ensure that the financingof our Organization is placed on a firm and lasting base.May I recall in this context that the Government ofthe Republic of Cyprus is voluntarily contributing onethird of the total cost of the United Nations Peace-keepingForce in Cyprus and  in addition  has increased by onethird its contribution to United Nations peace-keepingoperations in general.During 1996  various high-level working groups of theGeneral Assembly have continued their efforts on theinstitutional and financial reforms of the United Nations. Iwould like to reiterate that we consider the work of theseworking groups  covering a very broad spectrum of issues to be extremely important. Such issues  ranging from thestrengthening of the main United Nations organs to thefurther development of an Agenda for Peace and an Agendafor Development  deserve deep and profound priorityconsideration.We subscribe to the need to reform the SecurityCouncil  to expand it and strengthen its capacity todischarge the duties assigned to it by the Charter for themaintenance of international peace and security. As for thereform of its working methods  we recognize  that althoughsignificant efforts have been made over the past two yearsto ensure greater transparency and broader consultationswith non-members  more remains to be done. A goodprecedent has been established with the holding of briefingsand regular consultations  including those with countriesthat contribute troops to United Nations peacekeepingoperations.The reports of the working groups of the GeneralAssembly and the proposals from Member States that wehave before us provide a good basis for further work. Weall understand and accept the need to reform and revitalizeour Organization. Our responsibility  then  is quite clear:Let us make even more vigorous efforts and display thecourage and political will required to reach a successfulconclusion on these issues.This year’s international conferences — HABITAT II the World Food Summit and the United Nations Conferenceon Trade and Development — have marked the completionof a comprehensive series of United Nations-sponsoredconferences which covered the full range of civil  political economic and social issues that affect the peoples of theworld. We attach great importance to the successfulfollow-up to United Nations-sponsored conferences andtheir impact on those areas of the world where the lack ofeconomic and social development often contributes toconflict. In this respect  we welcome next year’s GeneralAssembly special session  which will be devoted to theassessment and review of Agenda 21 and of the results ofthe United Nations Conference on Environment andDevelopment. It will be a unique opportunity to take stockof what we have done so far to implement therecommendations agreed upon in that all-importantConference.An area of particular concern in today’s world is thepersistent violation of human rights. The human rightsagenda has for many years been dominated by efforts toestablish international standards. Our duty must be toimplement these standards unequivocally and to take afirm stand against all forms of human rights violations inall cases. The full implementation of the commitmentsentered into will encourage those around the world whobelieve in the promise of the United Nations to helprestore and keep the peace  to promote respect for humanrights  to expand and broaden social progress  and to helpthose in urgent need. My country is fully committed tothe universal application and promotion of theseprinciples.Another area of particular concern to Member Statesis arms control and disarmament. Under the auspices ofthe United Nations  the nuclear non-proliferation regimehas been further strengthened by the indefinite extensionof the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of NuclearWeapons. We warmly welcome the adoption by theGeneral Assembly of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. This represents the international community’sdetermination to bring to completion one of the mostsought-after nuclear non-proliferation and disarmamentmeasures in the history of the United Nations. But theTreaty is not the end of the process. There is need forfurther systematic and progressive effort in order toachieve our ultimate goal of the elimination of nuclearweapons and of general and complete disarmament understrict and effective international control.Another important development in the field ofdisarmament and arms control is progress achievedtowards the entry into force of the Chemical WeaponsConvention. Cyprus is in the final stages of ratifying thisConvention. It is our hope that it will soon enter intoforce. While recognizing that much more needs to bedone in the realm of conventional weapons  we areencouraged by the progress made during the review of theConvention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use ofCertain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemedto Be Excessively Injurious or To Have IndiscriminateEffects and the agreement on Guidelines for internationalarms transfers at this year’s United Nations DisarmamentCommission’s session.We fully share the view espoused by many that armscontrol and disarmament are and will continue to be2essential components of international security  contributingto confidence-building and conflict resolution. It is in thisspirit that we proposed  as part of a comprehensive solutionto the Cyprus problem  the complete demilitarization of theRepublic of Cyprus  in which we have offered to disbandthe National Guard of Cyprus and hand over all weapons toan international force in exchange for the completewithdrawal of all foreign troops  as demanded by therelevant United Nations resolutions.This body is familiar with the Secretary-General’sreport which characterizes the northern occupied part ofCyprus as one of the most densely militarized areas in theworld. The presence of 35 000 Turkish troops and hundredsof tanks and other armaments constitutes a clear andpresent danger to peace and security in Cyprus and in theregion. Recent events in Cyprus have highlighted this cleardanger as well as the urgent need to implement ourdemilitarization proposal. This year’s twenty-secondanniversary of the invasion and occupation of substantialterritory of the Republic of Cyprus by Turkish forces wasmarked by the brutal killings of two Greek-Cypriotunarmed demonstrators  witnessed on television screens bythe entire world  and the wounding of many others including two United Nations peace-keepers  by the Turkishoccupation troops and Turkish extremists imported frommainland Turkey to the occupied part of the island.Two United Nations reports on these tragic incidentsstate clearly that the responsibility lies with Turkey and theillegal Turkish-Cypriot regime  which used excessive andunwarranted force against unarmed demonstrators who weresimply trying to remind the world that for 22 years Cyprushas remained a divided country whose people are stillprevented by the Turkish occupation forces from returningto their homes and lands and from moving freely in theircountry. Furthermore  it has by now become abundantlyclear that the Turkish action was orchestrated well inadvance and involved the import from Turkey of 3 000terrorists belonging to the Gray Wolves organization withthe goal of provoking bloody confrontation between Greekand Turkish Cypriots. This sinister plan was aimed atdemonstrating that the two communities cannot livepeacefully together in Cyprus and therefore separatist andpartitionist solutions should be sought.While we mourn and condemn the brutal murder ofthe two unarmed Greek Cypriot protesters  we also feelsorry for the subsequent killing of a Turkish soldier and thewounding of another. We regret the haste with which theTurkish Cypriot leader  Mr. Denktas¸  attempted to attributeresponsibility for this killing to the Greek Cypriot sidebefore an independent United Nations investigationpublished its findings. The recent tragic events  however will not cause us to waver from our commitment to seeka peaceful solution of the Cyprus problem throughnegotiations  as provided by the United Nationsresolutions. These events only highlight the need toexpedite and increase efforts to find a just  lasting andworkable solution to the Cyprus problem.We are encouraged by the rekindled interest andmore active engagement of the international communityin the Cyprus problem  as witnessed by the appointmentsof Special Representatives from interested countries including the appointment of the Secretary-General’sSpecial Representative  Mr. Han Sung-Joo. We welcomeall initiatives set out to reinforce the United Nations inthe search for a just and viable solution to the Cyprusquestion.Various United Nations resolutions  and the UnitedNations Secretary-General himself  have declared thepresent status quo in Cyprus unacceptable  a view sharedby the international community. The time has come tomake a further determined and sustained effort to solvethe Cyprus problem. To that end  the Government of theRepublic of Cyprus will be working earnestly andimaginatively with the United Nations SpecialRepresentative and with all others supporting its efforts toprepare the ground for negotiations on the mainoutstanding issues.Any settlement of the Cyprus problem should bebased on a State of Cyprus with a single sovereignty  aninternational personality and a single citizenship. Itsindependence and territorial integrity must be safeguarded and it must be composed of two politically equalcommunities  as described in the relevant SecurityCouncil resolutions  in a bicommunal and bi-zonalfederation. Such settlement must exclude union  in wholeor in part  with any other country or any form of partitionor secession.The security of both communities is a crucial issue which would be helpful in finding a solution. It will benecessary to devise effective guarantees; demilitarizationand the stationing in Cyprus of an international force willalso be required. Demilitarization represents an importantcontribution to this settlement.We are prepared to embark on face-to-facenegotiations in 1997 once the ground has been sufficientlyprepared to ensure success. We are not  however  willing 3after 22 years of negotiations that have yielded no resultson the main issues of the problem  to embark on anotherround of fruitless talks. On the one hand  they destroy thecredibility of the negotiating process  and on the other  theykeep the attention of the international community focusedon the intercommunal constitutional aspect of the problem thus overshadowing the real issue — the invasion andcontinued occupation  for 22 years  of substantial territoryof the Republic of Cyprus by the Turkish forces.We  for our part  will continue to do everything in ourpower to help the Secretary-General of our Organization tosucceed in his renewed efforts  through his newly appointedSpecial Representative  in the search for a lasting solutionto the Cyprus problem.At the same time the Government of the Republic ofCyprus will pursue its application for membership in theEuropean Union  because such membership will havebenefits for both communities. While we hope to keepaccession negotiations to the timetable already foreseen  weearnestly desire to reach a solution to our problem beforeaccession.At the beginning of my statement  I spoke of the needto reform and strengthen our Organization. From thisrostrum  I have repeatedly underlined the importance ofhonouring the commitments we enter into and ofimplementing the decisions we take. I have stressed howessential it is to uphold the principles of the United NationsCharter and to hold to full account those who violate them.The question of Cyprus continues to be such a case ofaccountability  due to the refusal of Turkey to implementsolemn Security Council and General Assembly resolutionscalling for  among other things  the respect of thesovereignty  independence  territorial integrity and unity ofthe Republic of Cyprus  the withdrawal of all foreigntroops  the return of the refugees to their homes and lands the respect of the demographic composition of the Republicand the restoration of the basic human rights andfundamental freedoms of the people of Cyprus. In fact  notonly has Turkey not implemented these resolutions  but ithas grossly violated them. Even the immense humanitarianproblem of the missing persons remains unresolved perpetuating the tragedy of their relatives. All efforts shouldtherefore be exerted by the Security Council  and by allthose in a position to do so  to bring about a real change inTurkey’s attitude.The fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations hashighlighted the need to maintain and reinforce our faith andthat of future generations in our Organization.Implementation of United Nations decisions will go along way towards achieving this lofty goal."
"42",1795,"CZE",51,1996,"﻿Let me congratulateAmbassador Razali on his election to the office of Presidentof the fifty-first session of the General Assembly and wishhim all the best in that challenging post. I would also liketo thank the outgoing President  Mr. Diogo Freitas doAmaral  for the outstanding manner in which he conductedthe work of the previous session.A year ago  many world leaders gathered here tocommemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nationsand  in particular  to discuss its future prospects. No onequestioned its importance as a worldwide forum for dealingwith important global problems. Based on the principle ofuniversality  it should be open to all those who are willingand ready to participate in this endeavour.But as it enters the second half-century of itsexistence  the United Nations faces increasing  ever morecomplex and often even conflicting demands. Its responsehas often been to try to do everything  eventually wateringdown its energies and drive  thus contributing to aperception of declining efficiency. It should in fact focusonly on what it does best: maintaining international peaceand security  promoting respect for human rights  providingdevelopment assistance and alleviating human suffering.We therefore believe that a critical stage in its reformshould consist of setting out clear-cut priorities for UnitedNations action. There are areas where the United Nationsholds a competitive advantage  where it can act moreefficiently than individual States or regional organizations and where it has proven its ability to achieve more cost-effective and rapid results than other entities.Reform is no longer a subject for discussion. Actionis needed. Significant steps in the right direction have  ofcourse  already been taken. We have noted withsatisfaction the gradual downsizing of the Secretariat inthe past several years and the adoption of a no-growthbudget for the current period. Similar efforts byspecialized agencies have furthermore included movestowards their better coordination. We welcome theestablishment of an Efficiency Board within theSecretariat.Though reform is well under way  the current systemis still hindered by overlapping mandates and duplicationin the work of various United Nations bodies andspecialized agencies. Departments within secretariatssuffer from insufficient coordination and oversightmechanisms  unclear priorities and bureaucraticprocedures. Intense reflection on these matters is takingplace in various United Nations bodies. The Open-endedHigh-level Working Group on the Strengthening of theUnited Nations System has discussed rationalizing theGeneral Assembly’s methods and organization of itswork  streamlining its agenda and reshaping its subsidiarymachinery  as well as reforming the structures andfunctioning of the Secretariat. We hope that some of theseideas will mature enough to be presented as formalrecommendations to the General Assembly.The financial situation of the United Nationscontinues to be critical  in spite of a reduction inpeacekeeping activities. In our view  there are two maincauses of this situation: the present method of assessingcontributions and arrears.On the first point  we believe that a new scale ofassessments should be developed that would equitablyreflect the economic circumstances of individual MemberStates and their capacity to pay  based primarily on grossnational product (GNP) indicators. On the second point it is essential that Member States fulfil their financialobligations in full  on time and without conditions.Certain incentives and disincentives should be adopted toencourage Member States to honour their financialcommitments. These measures  however  should not beapplied to Members unable to pay for reasons beyondtheir control.The Czech Republic fully associates itself with theEuropean Union’s package of financial proposals. I recallalso that our share of peacekeeping operations has notbeen determined yet. We take this issue very seriouslyand have made certain specific proposals to resolve it.17Security Council reform has attracted extremely wideattention. As I mentioned in 1995  we support an increasein both permanent and non-permanent seats while insistingon safeguarding rapid and effective Council action. Yet themore members it has  the more its effectiveness will behindered. In our view  therefore  only a modest expansionis feasible. We oppose new categories of membership.The criteria for new permanent members shouldinclude their level of commitment to maintaining peace  topromoting development and to meeting their financialobligations to the United Nations. We believe Germany andJapan are suitable candidates  and support an expandedrepresentation of Africa  Latin America and Asia.The second aspect of Security Council reform relatesto its working methods. Several proposals have beensubmitted  including the Czech one  on a broaderinterpretation of Article 31 of the United Nations Charter.The proposals submitted include a number of pointsacceptable to the overwhelming majority of Member States.We regret that the Working Group on the Security Councilhas not yet reached consensus on any of them. We believethat issues not requiring amendments to the Charter shouldbe resolved separately from those that would. We willpursue our efforts in this respect and strive for someagreement next year.Having been elected to the Economic and SocialCouncil and having assumed the post of its Vice-President we have taken on a fair share of responsibility for its work.We strongly support reform efforts to restructure theCouncil and to enhance its efficiency and its coordinatingrole. It should more adequately reflect the new worldeconomic and social situation. We believe that theCouncil’s position within the United Nations system shouldbe strengthened and its procedures streamlined. It shouldprovide policy guidance for development activities andbecome the supreme steering and coordinating body for allUnited Nations-based programmes that fall under itspurview.Restructuring its functional commissions is a keyaspect of its reform. Regional economic commissionsshould play a more visible role. Upgrading developmentcooperation with Bretton Woods institutions and the WorldTrade Organization is another challenge for the Economicand Social Council. To reduce duplication with the GeneralAssembly  the Council should pass on to the Assembly onlythose issues that it does not have the power to decide byitself. On the other hand  the General Assembly shouldstrike from its agenda those items that are fully within theCouncil’s authority.Although the Czech Republic’s two-year term on theSecurity Council expired at the end of 1995  we continueto pay attention to the conflicts and other events thatendanger world peace and security.The Dayton peace process gave a chance to thepeople of Bosnia and Herzegovina and to the othercountries involved. The September 1996 electionsconstituted a milestone on the road to a lasting peace inthe Balkans. The Organization for Security andCooperation in Europe performed its election task in anoutstanding manner. We applaud all those whoparticipated in those elections.On the other hand  we cannot ignore the fact that theelection results reconfirmed ethnic divisions in thecountry. It will not be easy for the parties to overcomethis problem. The international community shouldtherefore remain alert and continue in its peacefulengagement by committing the necessary troops and byexerting political pressure on all the parties to keep up themomentum of the Dayton peace process. Local elections to be held in November  are the next step in this process.It is important that all planned political institutions beformed and start functioning as soon as possible.Another area of deep interest to us is the MiddleEast. As a participant in the multilateral talks on peaceand economic cooperation in the Middle East and as oneof the donor States in the area  we have consistentlyvoiced our full support for the continuation of the peaceprocess based on a just and comprehensive solution of theissues. We do so again today with renewed urgency inview of the recent tragic events in Jerusalem.Security and stability in the Gulf region areimportant to the Czech Republic. We support all effortsto solve the tense situation concerning Iraq. Iraq mustcomply unconditionally with all relevant Security Councilresolutions in order for sanctions to be lifted and for Iraqto return to the international community. At the sametime  the territorial integrity of Iraq must be preserved.We look forward to a peaceful resolution of the Iraqiissue. For humanitarian reasons we hope that SecurityCouncil resolution 986 (1995) is implemented as soon asconditions permit.Despite geographical distance  we are deeplyconcerned by conflicts in African countries  such as18Angola  Somalia  Liberia  Rwanda and Burundi. Mycountry supports United Nations efforts to rid thesecountries of war and suffering  which  besides engenderingviolence  further widen the gap between developedcountries and these often desperately poor countries.The Czech Republic intends to contribute tointernational stability and economic development.Domestically  we laid the foundations for this policy bystrengthening our democratic institutions and by reformingour economy. Internationally  this effort was endorsed lastDecember when the Czech Republic was admitted to theOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development(OECD). For my Government  OECD membership amountsalso to a serious commitment to share the knowledge andexperience of the Czech people with other countries and toprovide development assistance.Solid domestic results are also a precondition formembership in the European Union and in the NorthAtlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). These regionalarrangements are vital for Europe’s security structure.Through membership in NATO  the Czech Republic intendsto contribute to Europe’s security and stability. Thedecision on our membership will be made by NATOmembers and by our country. Russia’s participation indiscussions on European security is  of course  critical  andwe understand the need for a strategic partnership betweenNATO and the Russian Federation. These discussions however  should not precondition the process of NATOenlargement.Peacekeeping is an important tool in the hands of theSecurity Council. However  it has its limits  in so far ashostilities often occur within States. These limits aredictated by the principles of impartiality  the non-use offorce — except in self-defence — and consent of theparties. Following United Nations experiences in Somalia Bosnia and Herzegovina and  most recently  in Liberia unwarranted enthusiasm concerning peacekeepers hasevaporated.The Czech Republic has been actively participating inUnited Nations peacekeeping. We support the establishmentof stand-by arrangements and intend to participate in thesystem aimed at expanding United Nations capacities todeploy its forces. My country’s participation in theImplementation Force (IFOR) in Bosnia and Herzegovinais our current major effort devoted to peace. The UnitedNations does not have peace-enforcement instruments of itsown  but regional arrangements are often useful inenforcing peace. Our IFOR experience only confirms this.Last year we signed the Convention on the Safety ofUnited Nations and Associated Personnel  and weanticipate its early ratification. We hope that it will enterinto force soon.The fifth Review Conference of the Treaty on theNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) reconfirmedthe elimination of nuclear weapons as its ultimate goal.Concluding the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treatyrepresents a significant step in this direction  and weintend to sign the Treaty very shortly. It is disturbinghowever  that the Conference on Disarmament did notreach consensus on this question and that the Treaty wasnot adopted unanimously. Every effort should be made toachieve universality of NPT membership. Perhaps themost important task is the implementation of Article VIof the Treaty. The role of the Conference onDisarmament in this process is irreplaceable and will takeon even more importance  as the Conference is expectedto deal with another growing problem that we want tohelp resolve — the elimination of anti-personnellandmines.Matters of security have long ceased to be onlymatters of armies and weapons. The devastating socialdamage done by drug abuse and illicit drug traffickingthreaten the entire international community. Closeinternational cooperation in tackling the drug menaceshould be our response to this dangerous challenge.International terrorism is another source of greatconcern. The international community must stand unitedto suppress it. It is the responsibility of each State to fightterrorism and to strictly apply and abide by allinternational instruments in this field. We appeal to Statesthat have not ratified the appropriate conventions to do sowithout delay and to implement them.The Czech Government attaches great importance tothe promotion of human rights and in particular to UnitedNations activities in this field. An environment thatupholds human rights is our best protection as individualsand as a society. We defend human rights because it is inour own best interest. This year the Czech Republic hasbeen elected to the United Nations Commission onHuman Rights. As a member of the Commission  weintend to contribute actively to its work and to meet theobjectives of the international community in this field.President Havel is one of the 16 Heads of State orGovernment who have recently issued a statement onreviving multilateralism. The statement voices deep19concern over the lack of progress  both in pace and inscope  of multilateral renewal. Nations must either moveforward to reform and strengthen the United Nationssystem  or we risk facing a weakened solidarity  moreunilateralism and perhaps conflict and overt disregard ofinternational law and human values. Multilateral diplomacygoes well beyond the United Nations itself. Regionalcooperation is crucial to strengthening global cooperation.Without a stronger United Nations  however  other forms ofinternational cooperation will lose coherence."
"43",1857,"DEU",51,1996,"﻿Last year wetook stock of half a century of United Nations history. Therock we are pushing up the hill like Sisyphus always seemsto roll back a little. We must not be discouraged by this. Itremains our responsibility to do what we solemnlyreaffirmed on the fiftieth anniversary of the worldOrganization: maintain peace and to help people who aresuffering from want and poverty.You  Mr. President  have issued a warning to us all forthis fifty-first General Assembly. We must look beyond ournational borders  and think and act accordingly. Aftermaking those anniversary promises  let us not fall back intothe old routine and rituals. The vision of a more peacefuland more equitable world must not be lost.The world Organization must continue to be theworld’s conscience. For who else other than this forum isto keep watch to prevent murder and torture  to ensure thatrefugees have the basic necessities of life and that ourchildren are protected and cared for?The world is grossly unjust. From the moment of birthmillions of people have hardly any chance of living inconditions worthy of humankind. No one can turn awayfrom this; it concerns us all. No country  no region andno group of States can bear all of the world’s burdens andtroubles alone. All  even the strongest among us  needsolidarity  need the help of others. How can terrorism  forinstance  a cancer of our time  be stopped withoutinternational cooperation?Developments over the past 10 years have shownthere is no cause for resignation. There can beprogress — provided we pool our resources and acttogether. That is the lesson of Bosnia  of South Africaand of the Middle East  and of the historic achievementsin the field of disarmament in recent years. Every childthat is saved from death in Rwanda or Burundi  everyrefugee able to return to his native village in Bosnia every rainforest area we can preserve  must strengthen ourhope. The one world requires us to act as one.In Bosnia and Herzegovina  a free election has beenheld for the first time after four terrible years of war. Ithas provided a crucial foundation for the country’srecovery. Joint institutions must now be created withoutdelay. The future members of the three-person presidencyshould meet in Sarajevo before the end of September.The Organization for Security and Cooperation inEurope (OSCE) had a very difficult task supervising theelection in Bosnia. That organization’s scope for actionmust be increased at the Lisbon Summit in December thisyear. The OSCE remains an indispensable pillar of thenew peaceful order for Europe  which we believe to benecessary now that the iron curtain has come down.The forces working for peace in the region arethemselves not strong enough; there is still no self-sustaining stability. In Bosnia and Herzegovina there canbe no permanent international police force — even the60 000 troops of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization(NATO)  of the United Nations and of all the othercountries cannot guarantee peace on the ground — but Ithink that for a limited time that country continues torequire a “fire brigade”. This presupposes a fresh mandatefrom the Security Council.Germany is willing to provide a militarycontribution. By admitting more than 320 000 warrefugees from Bosnia and Herzegovina  Germany haspractised human solidarity. We also have more than130 000 Yugoslav nationals  most of them from Kosovo who have to return to their native regions. This is a heavyburden for us  including in financial terms. But we gave7temporary protection and shelter to these people onhumanitarian grounds  and we will not be found wanting inthis respect now that their repatriation is becoming possible.Europe has been torn by fratricidal wars for centuries.The current peaceful unification of that continent is amessage of hope for the whole world. The first of ourcentral and eastern European neighbours will soon belongto the Euro-Atlantic institutions.My country Germany owes its unity to the confidencewhich the world placed in our policy of reconciliation andgood neighbourliness. In our eyes that implies a duty:together with France  we will remain the motor of EuropeanUnion.Addressing the Assembly in 1989  my predecessorHans-Dietrich Genscher extended a hand to Poland. TodayI turn to our Czech neighbours in particular and say that theGerman-Czech declaration will be adopted shortly. Czechsand Germans can look confidently to a common Europeanfuture.The Russian people too must be winners in the processof European unification. The special partnership whichNATO is seeking with Russia is of central importance forpeace and security in Europe. And that is why we want asquickly as possible to draft the fundamentals of a charterbetween NATO and Russia  as I suggested in Carcassonne18 months ago at a meeting of the European Union foreignministers. Our offer stands. Russia should help shapeEurope’s future as an equal partner. That large andimportant country must be given a place in Europecommensurate with its size and importance.Part of the European Union’s peace message is thatwe Europeans stand for a policy of internationalcooperation among equals  and for a global partnership fordevelopment and the environment in the twenty-firstcentury. New opportunities for such a partnership derivefrom the globalization of industry and technology. Neverhave so many people experienced so much progress as inthe past 10 years. In the year 2020  if the present trendcontinues  the 15 countries with the largest gross nationalproducts will include nine of today’s developing countries.The recipe is free markets  democracy  reliability ofthe judicial system  and integration into the globaleconomy. This kind of good governance was rewarded with$150 billion of private direct investment in 1995.However  90 per cent of that investment has gone toonly 12 countries  and the gap between the poor and therest of the world continues to widen. The World Summitfor Social Development put the number of poor people at1.3 billion  nearly a quarter of the entire human race. Thiscalls for action from both sides  help from the communityof nations and self-help on the part of the countriesconcerned. The one is the precondition for the other.This evening I am having another meeting with myAfrican colleagues. I take a very keen interest in thefuture of Europe’s vast neighbouring continent. Weshould not see only Africa’s negative side but the hopefulsigns as well  and there are such signs. Democratizationis progressing  as shown by the fact that elections havetaken place or are scheduled in 17 countries this year.Average economic growth has outpaced populationgrowth for the first time in many years. Life expectancyhas increased by more than 25 per cent since 1960  andever more children are going to school.Germany supports Africa’s integration into the worldeconomy and the development of its own capabilities. TheUnited Nations New Agenda for the Development ofAfrica in the 1990s is a sound foundation for theseefforts. The Secretary-General’s United Nations System-wide Initiative on Africa should likewise be used by allconcerned as a basis for joint action.However  much remains to be done. The ghastlyevents in Rwanda must not be repeated in Burundi. Onthe other hand  the United Nations should not be theorganization of first resort in every conflict situation. Itcannot solve every problem. Hence  the regionalorganizations must assume a larger measure ofresponsibility.The Organization of African Unity  like theOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe  hasmatured to a degree that commands respect. Germany with one eye on Burundi  has to date provided onemillion deutsche mark in support of that organization’sconflict prevention mechanism. High hopes have beenplaced in the efforts of Julius Nyerere. The proposedconference on the Great Lakes region has the support ofGermany and the European Union.Germany will remain a good partner and friend tothe nations of Africa. That will also be my message at theforthcoming second European Union-Southern AfricanDevelopment Community (SADC) ministerial meeting inWindhoek. The regionalization process in Africa is an8element of hope. The outstanding example is southernAfrica with the SADC. That region must become alocomotive for the whole continent.One neighbouring region whose fate touches Europeis the Middle East. That is also the main reason for ourstrong commitment in the whole Middle East region. Forhistorical reasons  Germany has a special relationship withIsrael; that remains unshakable. Bilaterally and through theEuropean Union we are the most important donor for thePalestinians. Germany will maintain that commitment. Iconfirmed this in my recent meetings with Israeli ForeignMinister Levy and with President Yasser Arafat in Bonn.Terrorists should not be given any chance to block thepath to peace. The sealing off of Gaza and the West Bankmust be eased and discontinued as soon as possible. Thatis our common endeavour. The struggle against terrorismmust remain at the top of the international agenda. Iurgently appeal to all concerned to resume the peaceprocess without delay. There is no alternative.It has been estimated that the world’s population willnumber about 10 billion in 2030. For their sake  for thesake of our children and grandchildren  we must take stepstoday to ensure that the Earth remains habitable. Peace andhuman dignity  economic progress and protection of thenatural foundations of life are inseparable. Without socialjustice  without any vision for the world’s economicprogress  we shall not be able to break the vicious circle ofpoverty  environmental destruction and populationexplosion.We have no time to lose. Every second three babiesare born  and every year the world’s population increasesby nearly 100 million. All of them need food  clothing schools and a home. Every minute about 12 acres oftropical rain forest are lost  an area the size of 40 footballpitches.Antoine de Saint-Exupéry warned that the human racehad not inherited the Earth from its fathers but hadborrowed it from its children. We became acutely aware ofthis at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. North andSouth  East and West  are struggling to survive together inspaceship Earth  whose blue protective shield is becomingincreasingly fragile.Our task now is to convert that environmentalawareness into environmental action. The year 1997 will becrucial for such action. The special session of the GeneralAssembly devoted to environment and development mustchart the course for the next millennium in order torestore the balance between man  nature and the economy.Germany’s industrial community has voluntarilyundertaken to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions by20 per cent by the year 2005. Since 1990  Germany hasreduced those emissions by nearly 13 per cent andthereby has led the way for the rest of the world.We are contributing 312 million deutsche mark tothe pilot programme to protect Brazil’s tropical forests.That represents 60 per cent of the total contributionsmade so far. We appeal to the community of nations tobecome more heavily involved in this programme. Wecan only succeed together or fail together.At the 1997 climate conference in Japan we mustachieve the objective agreed upon in Berlin 12 monthsago: the adoption of a substantive and binding protocol toreduce greenhouse gas emissions. At the recent Genevaconference  the great majority of nations came out infavour of specific targets and time limits. This isencouraging.I wish to thank all members once again forsupporting our efforts to have the secretariat of theFramework Convention on Climate Change established inBonn. May I also ask members to support our proposalthat the secretariat of the Framework Convention toCombat Desertification likewise be located in Bonn  as ithas to cooperate closely with the climate secretariat. TheUnited Nations will find that living and workingconditions in our country are good.The Rio Declaration on Environment andDevelopment rightly makes people the focal point of allefforts. We must continue to concentrate on combatingpoverty and providing basic and vocational education.Even if that is not the kind of subject that makesheadlines  it is and will remain  together withpeacekeeping  one of our principal tasks.Equal opportunities for women must not remainmere theory.Nothing is more powerful than an idea whose timehas come  is a saying that applies to human dignity andhuman rights. The fall of the Berlin Wall showed that thepeople’s pursuit of freedom and personal happiness is  inthe long run  stronger than any dictatorship. That is whythe worldwide defence of human rights will likewise notbe in vain.It all boils down to something quite natural: that wetreat one another as humans and that we do not inflict uponothers what we would not like to have inflicted uponourselves. Murderers and torturers must not be allowed tosleep peacefully. Mladic´ and Karadzic´  and all for whomarrest warrants have been issued  deserve to be broughtbefore the International Tribunal in The Hague. Germanycalls for the early convening of a conference to establish aninternational criminal court.There is a core of human rights that are common to usall and that are universally valid. This fact receivedinternational confirmation at the Vienna Conference onHuman Rights. There can and should be no withdrawalfrom that position.With the East-West confrontation now consigned tothe past  intercultural dialogue assumes ever-greatersignificance. Close to 2.5 million Muslims are living inGermany. If only for this reason  it is of special importanceto develop greater mutual understanding betweenChristianity and Islam.A subject very close to my heart  as former Ministerof Justice  is the protection of our children  the weakestmembers of society. Universal Children’s Day wasobserved on 20 September. Its motto: “Children haverights”. What do those rights look like in reality? Every day35 000 children die of hunger. Twelve million children donot live beyond the age of 5. Two million are forced intoprostitution. Two hundred thousand children around theworld are used as soldiers in war. Millions of them are usedas cheap labour.The Stockholm conference on sexual abuse of childrenhas awakened world opinion  and I should like to thank theSwedish Government for having hosted and organized thisconference  which shocked us all into action. The atrociousway many of our children are being treated is a disgrace —a disgrace — to our civilization. The Stockholm Plan ofAction must be followed by global action. This we owe toour children. And I should like to make it very clear thatanyone who violates the weakest members of society —children  that is — deserves to be outlawed by society.Peace is not everything  but without peace everythingis nothing. These words originate from the time when Eastand West faced each other armed to the teeth. In themeantime the nightmare of a nuclear inferno has beendispelled. Yesterday’s signing of the ComprehensiveNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty was another momentous step inthis process  I believe  after half a century of internationaldebate and protest against nuclear testing.In expressing my thanks to Australia I appeal to allnations to ratify the Treaty as soon as possible. Since theend of the Second World War upwards of 2 000 nucleartests have been carried out. We now have the chance toput a stop to them once and for all. Anyone who rejectssomething good because they will only accept somethingperfect should be mindful of their responsibility to futuregenerations. We cannot force the atomic genie back intothe bottle  but we owe it to our children andgrandchildren to tame it — at least to tame it.The total abolition of all chemical weapons is ofsimilar consequence. The Chemical Weapons Conventionmust enter into force next spring. All nations  andespecially those with the largest stockpiles of suchweapons  must meet their tremendous responsibility andratify the Convention as soon as possible.I should also like to touch upon an issue that I takea very personal  keen interest in  and that is a totallydifferent kind of mass-destruction weapon: anti-personnelmines. I travelled to Mozambique and Cambodia and tooka look at the situation there. Hundreds of millions of suchanti-personnel mines are still in the ground. Year in  yearout they kill and maim 20 000 people and make entireregions permanently uninhabitable. These treacheroustools of murder must be banned.Germany has completely renounced anti-personnelmines and imposed a unilateral  open-ended ban onexports. Residual stocks are to be destroyed by the end of1997. In my Seven-Point Programme of Action I haveproposed a number of measures to maintain themomentum generated in Geneva. My main objective —because I think the motto should be “first things first” —is to improve the efficiency of mine clearance. We willattend a conference in Canada very soon which deals withthe political aspects of this issue  trying to ban land-mines. But we should also at the same time try toconcentrate on improving the efficiency of mineclearance  that is  testing and using mechanical clearanceequipment. We quickly need machinery that can be mass-produced in order to remove this plague without harmingpeople. I do not know whether anyone here has watcheda mine-clearance operation. It is done by people and canbe compared to trying to remove a sand-dune with aspoon. I think it is incredible that highly developed10nations such as ours and many others are not able toproduce a piece of machinery for a large-scale de-miningoperation. I want to focus the technical knowledge that wehave to make this matter progress as quickly as possible.If we want to win peace  we must not only considerconflict prevention; we must also pay greater attention tothe situation after the termination of military hostilities.Peace-building was the subject of the internationalconference that we sponsored in Berlin in July. Thatconference produced a number of interesting and tangibleresults  which we are making available to all MemberStates in the form of a report. Together with other countrieswe intend to submit to members during this session of theGeneral Assembly a draft resolution on peace consolidationthrough practical steps towards disarmament. Whether inBosnia  Rwanda or Angola  all previous efforts will provein vain unless we can prevent a resurgence of violence.Most of the burden is borne by the 26 000 or so BlueHelmets and civilian personnel making up the peacekeepingmissions  as well as by the countless courageous staff ofnon-governmental organizations who are doing their job allover the world under difficult conditions. Speaking here inthe United Nations  I should like to express my sincerethanks to the non-governmental organizations. We areproud of them.In our resolution marking the fiftieth anniversary ofthe United Nations  we solemnly undertook to pass on tothe next millennium a United Nations organization equippedand financed to perform its tasks. The greatest politicalsignificance attaches to reform of the Security Council  inwhose work we have been closely involved over the lasttwo years. This  the principal guardian of world peace  stillbears the countenance of the year 1945  but it now needs anew one for the year 2000. It is a question of enhancingthat body’s legitimacy  credibility and effectiveness. Aftera three-year debate the time has come to put the variouselements together and start the restructuring process  to nowget things done after having analysed what can be done.We are pleased that a large number of Member States arein favour of a permanent seat for Germany on the SecurityCouncil. I really believe that the time is approaching whenthe General Assembly will have to decide.What continues to require our immediate attention isthe financial crisis. The Organization’s rationalization andreform are indispensable and urgent. A glance at the booksis enough to tell us that. The regular United Nations budgetshows zero growth. The Secretariat has lost more than1 000 posts  and further reductions will follow next year.So much has already been achieved.I therefore take this opportunity to thank theSecretary-General and his staff  who  both at headquartersand in the field  continue to achieve outstanding resultsdespite the reductions in their numbers and the constantlack of funds. I should like to thank them very warmly.I wish to add another word if I may. The UnitedNations  in its actions and decisions  can be only asstrong as its Members allow it to be. People tend tooverlook that fact so readily when they criticize thisOrganization. I stress this point because I think that theoutside world has a distorted image of the United Nations.The United Nations is us  the Member States. We canonly achieve what we want to achieve together.I am afraid that I must repeat that we will have tosave and rationalize further still. The need for reform isno justification for refusing to pay contributions  however.Moreover  special rights also imply special duties. TheGerman-American philosopher Hans Jonas said thatresponsibility is the most important principle of the newage. Let us act in accordance with that principle."
"44",1895,"DJI",51,1996,"﻿My delegation offers itswarmest congratulations to you  Sir  on your election to thepresidency of the General Assembly at what will certainlybe a crucial session. We have come to know you over theyears  and have never failed to admire and appreciate yourrelentless activism  plain-speaking and valuablecontributions. We have no doubt that your uniqueexperience  coupled with your keen awareness of the issueson which we will have to deliberate  augur well for a mostproductive session.We also wish to record our gratitude to Mr. Freitas doAmaral  the outgoing President  for his direction andfocused leadership during the historic fiftieth anniversarysession. Much of the pace and progress in United Nationsreform efforts and activities this year are largely due to hiscommitment to achieving a meaningful and balancedoutcome on this difficult issue.We would also like to commend the Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for the perseveranceand dedication with which he has undertaken his duties.Saddled as it is with diminishing resources and increasinguncertainty regarding its role and mandate  the UnitedNations is going through trying times. The Secretary-General  however  has  against all odds  maintained thecontinuity and functioning of the Secretariat  tackling thedaily challenges facing mankind.My delegation  in conformity with the decision andrecommendation of the League of Arab States and theOrganization of African Unity  supports the re-electionbid of the Secretary-General for another term in order toenable him to accomplish the objectives of his mission.Fifty years ago  with great energy  grand vision anda considerable measure of optimism  the world embarkedupon a high-minded journey to end the scourge of war eliminate poverty and create a world of freedom andjustice for all. Much has been accomplished  and it cannotbe denied that humankind now has the power andresources to achieve the goals we set ourselves.Yet too many dreams remain shattered  too muchpotential remains unfulfilled  and too many conflictsremain in too many parts of the globe. The UnitedNations is bracing itself for more turbulent times ahead with bankruptcy on the horizon as it confronts the threatto either “reform or perish”. Remarkably  there is a placidair of “business as usual” pervading this session of theGeneral Assembly — a dream state in which all is welland normal. Given the dire predicament threatening theexistence of this Organization  does this reveal a measureof resignation? Is this the beginning of the end of theenthusiastic hope for a new world order with which thisdecade began? Does this explain why so many opportunitiesto address the pressing problems of our day have not beenrealized? While politically the world might be in a state offlux and transition  economically  however  it has enjoyedan unprecedented level of output — enough for every man woman and child on this planet to enjoy a happy and securelife.The vast majority of the people of the world  however have received minimal benefit. The facts are foreboding.The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)informs us that over the last decade income levels in some70 developing countries were lower than in the 1960s or1970s. The Administrator of the United NationsDevelopment Programme tellingly reminds us that thebelief that the developing world is doing very much betteris one of the great myths of the present. In fact  three fifthsof the world’s population live in poverty  millions areforced to migrate every year  and 15 per cent suffer fromchronic hunger and malnutrition. All this is taking placewhile world food production and reserves are declining inthe face of population growth. As most of us realize  muchof this stagnation is taking place in Africa.For all the oft-cited reasons — historical  colonial orcontemporary — Africa has been lagging behind on themarch to self-sustaining growth. Consequently  50 per centof its peoples live in poverty  with a quality of life that isnot expected to improve during this decade. While theincreasing flow of negative statistics on Africa tends tomask the substantial efforts for reform  pluralization andstructural adjustment that are taking place in many countrieson the continent  for most people the situation is life-threatening.There are  however  a few hopeful signs that theextent of Africa’s predicament has begun to draw thecritical attention it needs from the international community.In particular  the 10-year United Nations System-wideSpecial Initiative on Africa  launched in March by theSecretary-General  deserves a special mention. Although itdoes not represent new funding so much as the moreefficient use of available resources  it should prove useful.Together with this initiative  the formal endorsementlast week by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) andthe World Bank  during their annual meeting inWashington  of a plan to substantially reduce the debtburden of the world’s poorest and most heavily indebtednations  most of which are in Africa  is very encouraging.If current economic reform measures are to have thedesired impact  debt relief is crucial  particularly inreversing Africa’s increasing marginalization.But problems of degradation  poverty andunderdevelopment are hardly unique to Africa; they arefound in every corner of the world  and must be seriouslyaddressed if we are to rectify the frightening pace ofglobal polarization  both within and between countries.According to the Administrator of the United NationsDevelopment Programme  we are creating a planet that increasingly  is not one world but two.For all these reasons  the World Food Summit inRome next month  and the designation of the decade1997-2006 as the first United Nations Decade for theEradication of Poverty will provide the internationalcommunity with an opportunity to renew its commitmentrealistically to face those twin scourges of humankind.The conventional wisdom of today argues that the basicremedy for underdevelopment lies in embracing free andopen market economies  stimulated by private capital. Tothis end  the bulk of the world is engaged in restructuringto fit this mould. But with the dramatic shrinkage of theresources needed for transitional development —particularly those for official development assistance —self-sufficiency has become an almost impossible task.Compounding this dilemma  total private investment hasquadrupled since 1990  but only in ways that bypass mostdeveloping countries and fail to address their problems.The world remains laden with conflicts. It has beensaid that as many as 25 complex emergencies nowthreaten tens of millions of people worldwide every year that the convulsions are becoming larger  with widerrepercussions  and that this new generation of crises willcontinue until their underlying causes are properlyaddressed. Cold-war identities have lost relevance  andold identities and animosities have resurfaced. Manynation States have lost considerable cohesion and arebeing buffeted by external pressures and strains within.The consequent void of economic and political instabilityhas provided an opening for many unscrupulous  self-proclaimed “leaders” who  hungry for power  arereigniting the myths  latent prejudices  hatreds and fearslying in the dark recesses of so many minds. Employingviolence  propaganda and intimidation  such as we haveseen in Bosnia  Somalia  Cambodia and elsewhere  theyhave successfully pitted peoples against peoples. Thepredictable result has been an explosion in the number ofarmed conflicts  accompanied by widespread devastation both human and physical  gross violations of humanrights  and “ethnic cleansing”. This is a situation2increasingly in need of concerted international action and astrong  focused and impartial United Nations.The United Nations has  indeed  responded positivelyin many instances. Cambodia and Mozambique are cases inpoint. Some crises  however  have proved intractable invariably because of the nature of mandates or the politicalwill of Member States  whose changing views and policieshave affected the prospects for early resolution. Had theinternational community acted with dispatch in crisissituations  countless lives could have been saved and scarceresources conserved by forcing the belligerents to disarmunconditionally and to respect the rule of law.The widespread and indiscriminate use of anti-personnel mines in many conflict situations has beenconsistently devastating. We therefore welcome the SecurityCouncil statement of 30 August 1996 indicating the highpriority being given to demining. The effectiveness ofpeacekeeping will be greatly enhanced by making deminingan integral part of it. Sadly  however  these commendablemeasures will continue to fall short of what is requiredunless the international community imposes a moratorium if not a total ban  on the manufacture and deployment ofsuch devices. In the same vein  we hope that the adoptionof the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty will providean impetus to increased international cooperation  inaddition to marking a first viable step towards the totalelimination of weapons of mass destruction.The problems  conflicts and challenges of developmentand international cooperation are growing in complexity.Not surprisingly  therefore  as so many have noted  theUnited Nations system needs to be renewed and enabled torespond to these simultaneous challenges.Over the past two years  and particularly in the firsthalf of this year  a number of High-level Open-endedWorking Groups of the General Assembly have extensivelyexplored and deliberated on issues of reform as theyimpinge upon the financial situation  the enlargement composition and transparency of the Security Council  andthe Secretariat and General Assembly. Considerable time energy and resources have been expended in these efforts.However  differences persist among nations  reflectingdivergent national policies  views and interests.As might be expected  a proliferation of ideas andpositions is emerging from individual countries  including to name just a few  the United States  Italy  Belize andMalaysia  which have produced proposals and statements ofposition. Regional groups  including those in Africa  andalliances and coalitions  including the Non-AlignedMovement  have their own positions. All of them arejockeying for position so as to advance and strengthentheir individual or collective interests. The stalemate overSecurity Council reform is far from over and remains thetoughest problem. The real stumbling block is the numberand composition of the new permanent membership which must include developing countries from all parts ofthe world  including Africa  Asia and Latin America. Wemust also recognize that constructive participation in theCouncil by many smaller States has demonstrated that thepossession of large economies and large populationscannot be the exclusive criteria for permanentmembership.The tense circumstances persisting in a number ofStates in the Great Lakes region of Africa is a cause ofconcern to my country. This is true of Rwanda  wherebloated prisons  camps swollen with refugees and theslow pace of the judicial process are just a few of theproblems that continue to plague that country. TheInternational Tribunal for Rwanda has begun to function but with limited manpower and financial resources. TheTribunal must be seen to function effectively  as themessage it sends is crucial to resolving the Rwandanproblem.In neighbouring Burundi  the internationalcommunity remains haunted by the fear of a re-enactmentof the horrors that took place in Rwanda over two yearsago  where tens of thousands were massacred. There hasalready been a frightful human toll in Burundi since thearmy murdered the first democratically elected Presidentin 1993  marking the advent of instability and violence.Should the army — the de facto head of State andsupreme authority since 1993 — remain unprepared toaccept the authority of a democratically elected civiliangovernment  we may have a recipe for uncontrolledbloodshed. That is the real problem confronting theinternational community in resolving the Burundi debacle.Djibouti fully supports the efforts of the countries in theregion in imposing sanctions  whose objective is tocompel the new regime in Bujumbura to restoreconstitutional order and legality and to hand over powerto a legitimately elected government.With the explosion of violence in the territoriesoccupied by Israel  we have witnessed an alarmingdeterioration in prospects for peace in the Middle East.The Israeli act of opening a tunnel under one of Islam’sholiest shrines  the Al-Aqsa Mosque in East Jerusalem was yet another example of disrespect for  as well as3defiance of  international opinion. But more importantly  itwas yet another example of intransigent rule over EastJerusalem.It is difficult to deny that the ultimate Israeli aim is tochange the ground rules — in effect  unilaterally to redefinethe peace process  thereby rolling back the clock andreversing years of hard work  concessions  sacrifice andgood faith on the part of the previous Israeli Government the Palestinians  the Arabs  and the internationalcommunity. It is also disturbing that  while the world iswatching  Israel should decide openly to pursue a policy ofcreating “facts on the ground” in total disregard of theprinciples established in Oslo  the Washington peaceagreement and United Nations resolutions  all of whichemphasize the return of occupied land in exchange forpeace. It is little wonder that the current talks betweenMr. Netanyahu and Mr. Arafat  which began last week inWashington  have neither produced nor resolved anything.What we see instead are Israeli promises or commitmentsto keep talking to the Palestinians. But there has beenneither an action nor a promise to implement what hadalready been agreed upon  or even to contemplate the startof final status negotiations.The depth of Arab disillusionment is obvious. Thehard line policies pursued by the new Government aresimply fuelling fires of hatred and violence. Djibouti hopesthat reason will prevail  and calls on key countries andregions to continue providing the necessary direction leadership and reassurances for a return to previouscommitments. Having come so far and sacrificed so much and with so much at stake  we must not allow the peaceprocess to drift or wither away. In this context  we alsowish to underscore the urgent call of the Arab Summit inCairo in June for Israel to resume the peace process withinthe framework of the Madrid Conference  in accordancewith Security Council resolutions 242 (1967)  338 (1973)and 425 (1978).We share the anxiety in the Gulf region about the stateof the three islands of the United Arab Emirates that havebeen occupied by Iran  and we hope that this long-standingproblem will be resolved peacefully.Somalia continues to exist in a cycle of misery andpolitical impasse  lacking structures  an economy  a stablecivil society or legitimate authority. More disturbing  thereis neither peace nor war  and clashes continue unabated.Mogadishu and its infamous warlords remain the maelstromof Somalia. Despite almost five years of incessant fighting there are no signs of compromise or reconciliation. The lustfor power of a few has resulted in disaster for the wholecountry  whose condition is now a virtual replica of whatit was in the nineteenth century. There is simply nowhereto lay the blame for Somalia’s wretched state except onthe warlords and their inability to reason and reachagreement. This myopic vision of leadership seemsunlikely to change until one faction prevails  and that maytake years. Meanwhile  the people suffer  and the worldis watching. Somalia  we must conclude  remains afestering tragedy  a piece of unfinished business for theinternational community  an international embarrassment and a permanent problem. It will not go away simplybecause we refuse to address it  and it will certainlycontinue to be an indelible blemish on the Charter of theUnited Nations.The sooner we consider the far-reaching implicationsof the situation of this failed State  which is absent fromthis Hall  the better it will be for the Somali people andthe international community. Somalia is simply consumedby an interminable turmoil from which it cannot freeitself. It needs help — our help.With the holding of elections  the saga of Bosnia hasreached a decisive juncture. The problem facing theinternational community is the attempts to obstruct thenormalization process through the use of violence andintimidation  which increase the pressure for secession.However  one issue that is creating tremendous frustrationand confusion is the reluctance of the North AtlanticTreaty Organization (NATO) to apprehend the primeBosnian Serb war crime suspects — Karadžic´ andMladic´ — who are accused of instigating  planning andordering the genocide and “ethnic cleansing” in Bosnia.To date  74 arrest warrants have been issued for suspectedwar criminals  but only eight people are in custody. Thisfact  perhaps  reflects a political decision; but it is aparadoxical one whose effects may be with us in Bosniaand beyond for a long time.In conclusion  I wish to refer to an issue relating tomy own part of the world. Our corner of the globe  theHorn of Africa  seems to be passing through a period ofrenewed optimism and revival. This must be sustained.With the regional economy slowly but steadily recoveringfrom the effects of past turmoil  the need for enhancedcooperation cannot be overemphasized. Djibouti isumbilically linked to the pulse of its neighbours andcannot  therefore  be indifferent to their economic andtrade realities.4The conflicts and civil strife that have plagued theHorn of Africa in the past two decades have had adevastating effect on our economic and social life. This canbe readily observed in the unacceptable number ofdisplaced persons and refugees in my small country  forwhom our continued commitment to care is proving to beeconomically and socially overwhelming  if not disastrous.Djibouti’s approach to regional affairs is based onmutual respect  moderation and cooperation. We believethat all the countries in the Horn of Africa must togetherseek to resolve the common problems of poverty  conflictand underdevelopment  bilaterally and within the frameworkof the Inter-Governmental Authority on Drought andDevelopment (IGADD)  whose revitalization is crucial.Djibouti is in the midst of economic restructuring andinstitutional reforms. Given the demobilization process thatis now under way  we require generous assistance from theinternational donor community. Towards this end  we areplanning to organize a round table early next year  underthe aegis of the UNDP and the Bretton Woods institutions to address these problems and the accumulated effects ofregional instability. We have made a valiant effort  and weremain convinced that the donor community will  for itspart  work with us in order to surmount our multiplechallenges and create a better future for our citizens."
"45",1916,"DMA",51,1996,"﻿It is indeed a pleasurefor me to extend my delegation’s congratulations toAmbassador Razali and his country  Malaysia  on hiselection to the high office of President of the fifty-firstsession of the General Assembly. I entertain no doubt that17he will be able to draw upon his proven diplomatic skillsand considerable experience to guide the affairs of theGeneral Assembly in a creditable and exemplary manner.Permit me also to express my appreciation and thanks tohis immediate predecessor  Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral ofPortugal  for the competence which he demonstrated inpresiding over the historic fiftieth session of the GeneralAssembly.The United Nations was established 51 years ago witha focus on the maintenance of peace and security  andwhile that remains the objective  the linkage between peaceand economic and social development  enshrined in theCharter  must be recognized and strengthened if the worldis to escape the inexorable consequences of thecontinuously widening gap between rich and poor nations.We were led to believe that the peace dividend resultingfrom the end of the cold war would provide the engine forgreater economic development. Obviously  that has notmaterialized. Indeed  the opposite has occurred. Thedeveloping world continues to experience a steadyshrinkage of development assistance. And at this criticaljuncture  small island States  already hampered by size geographic location  topography and climatic conditions  arehaving their very existence threatened by the policies andpractices of multinationals  made all the more formidableby overwhelming support from their Governments.The production and export of bananas are vital to theeconomic viability of the Commonwealth of Dominica  asthey are to all the islands of the Windward group. Thebanana industry in the Windward Islands accounts for lessthan 5 per cent of world production. The producers aresmall landowners; the production costs are relatively high;and any attempt by the Windward Islands producers to selltheir products on the open market would be suicidal.Recognizing the peculiar difficulties of Windward Islandsproducers and their traditional access to the Europeanmarket  the European Union has established a regimereserving less than 10 per cent of its market for bananasfrom the Caribbean. That regime is now under attack frommultinationals in Latin America and elsewhere  with hugeresources augmented by the power  prestige and politicalmight of their national Governments.In the struggle to save an industry critical to oureconomic survival  our political stability and our democratictraditions and institutions  we call upon the internationalcommunity to take note of the very real possibility of socialupheaval and political disaster in the region if this challengeto the European Union regime were to succeed. It is ratherincongruous that the same forces that are at the forefront ofthe effort to establish democratic institutions andrepresentative governments in certain parts of the worldare also engaged in an enterprise which  if successful  iscalculated to destroy the free and democratic way of lifein the eastern Caribbean. The international community hasan interest in seeing that these small societies remain freeand stable  and it has an obligation to ensure that thatfreedom and stability subsist.The scourge of illicit drug traffic and drug abusemust continue to be of great concern to the internationalcommunity. The problem knows no boundary  it respectsno ideology or power  it makes no distinction betweenrich and poor  North and South  East and West. Its engineis driven by the prospect of huge fortunes amassedclandestinely and quickly. Universal in its destructiveforce  the illicit drug problem presents a unique challengeto the world. The Commonwealth of Dominica has takensteps  commensurate with its limited resources  to dealwith the problem at the national level  and it is a party tocooperative regional arrangements aimed at impeding thetrans-shipment of illicit drugs through the Caribbeanregion. Recognizing  however  that the problem isdemand-driven  we must make it clear that the prospectsfor success in this effort will remain dim unless there isa greater undertaking by the major consumer centres toreduce the demand for the product.Connected with international drug trafficking is theillegal trade in arms and  tangentially  internationalterrorism. The twin evils of illicit arms and internationalterrorism have as their purpose the destruction of innocentlives  the violation of the fundamental tenets of thecivilized world and the subversion of the democraticfreedoms of all mankind. An unprecedented effort byMembers of the United Nations will be required if we areto control the illicit trade in arms and extinguish thethreat of terrorism. Compounding the problem is the legaltrade in conventional weapons of increasing sophisticationand destructiveness. With regard to nuclear weapons  theCommonwealth of Dominica believes that the Non-Proliferation Treaty and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty are merely way-stations on the road to thedesirable end of a world free of all such arsenals.We are extremely concerned and aggrieved by thecontinuing practice of trans-shipping nuclear waste andother hazardous substances through the Caribbean Sea.Assurances of safe procedures and infinitesimal risks areunconvincing  particularly when such trans-shipments aremade through the Caribbean Sea during the hurricane18season and at a period of heightened seismic activity in theCaribbean region.The Commonwealth of Dominica  together with othermembers of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)continues to view this dangerous practice as a potentiallyserious threat to the fragile ecosystem and to the livelihoodand well-being of the people of the region  and we callupon the States engaging in the practice to demonstratesome regard for our justifiable concerns. We earnestly seekthe support of the international community in our ongoingeffort to halt the shipment of these dangerous materialsthrough the Caribbean Sea.For several decades  the Republic of China on Taiwanhas exercised and continues to exercise sovereign authorityover a defined geographical area inhabited today by 21million souls. This year  the process of political reformachieved its ultimate goal when  for the first time inhistory  the President of the Republic of China on Taiwanwas democratically elected in free and fair elections.Democracy is alive and well in the Republic of China onTaiwan. The peace and security of the region are notthreatened today  nor have they ever been threatened  by theRepublic of China on Taiwan. Indeed  the Republic ofChina’s human rights record  its commitment to marketeconomy and multilateralism and its economic assistanceprogrammes have served to enhance the prospects forpeace  security and stability in the area and beyond.As the members of the European Parliament stated intheir resolution of 17 July 1996  the Republic of China onTaiwan can play an important beneficial role in theinternational community  and it is clear that the exclusionof the Republic of China on Taiwan from the world’scouncils  from the United Nations and its specializedagencies  and from the major international financialinstitutions concerned with development and the eradicationof poverty is a detriment to us all. The Commonwealth ofDominica believes that on the principle of universality  theRepublic of China on Taiwan should be admitted as aMember of the United Nations.Just over two years ago the world applauded theprogress that had been made in the bilateral negotiationsbetween Israel and its Arab neighbours in the Middle East and we expressed cautious optimism with respect to theeventual resolution of the conflict and the progress towardsa full and just peace in the region. Recent events havegiven reason for pause  however. We recognize that asolution to the problem in the Middle East can only beachieved through the energies of the States in the regionand their genuine commitment to peace. But theinternational community and the United Nations inparticular have an interest — indeed  a duty — tofacilitate and assist the process towards the realization ofthe legitimate hopes  aspirations and security needs of thepeoples in the area.The Commonwealth of Dominica abhors the conceptof national laws having extraterritorial jurisdiction andserving as underpinnings for illegal secondary boycotts.We are particularly troubled by the potential use of theseinstruments by large and powerful States to compromisethe territorial integrity and national sovereignty of smallStates like ours.The restructuring and reform of the United Nationssystem continues in the face of a forced financial crisisthat undermines the very result intended by the reformprogramme  namely  an Organization with the capacity todischarge its worldwide obligations effectively andefficiently. We continue to be supportive of the efforts toexercise budgetary restraints  to reduce waste and toeliminate unnecessary duplication  but we caution againsta programme of retrenchment detrimental to the existenceof programmes designed to assist small developingnations. Indeed  we believe that the end-product of thereform of the United Nations should be an Organizationbetter equipped to be an effective force for developmentand economic growth.In this age of globalization  the United Nationscontinues to be an important agent for economic growthand development and a vital instrument in maintainingworld peace. The Commonwealth of Dominica recognizesand applauds the achievements of the United Nations inthose areas. The capacity of the Organization to meet thechallenges of the years ahead will depend on ourcollective will and commitment to effecting measurableimprovement in the human condition."
"46",1960,"DNK",51,1996,"﻿Encouraging trends can beseen in many parts of the world following the end of theEast-West confrontation. Democracy has taken firm root inmany countries. The improved economic performance ofmany countries is making an important contribution to thewelfare of peoples.At the same time  we still face difficult challenges.Ethnic and internal conflicts are taking a far heavier tollthan earlier international conflicts; grave cases of violationsof human rights occur; the poorest countries are laggingbehind in economic development; the gap between rich andpoor is growing; and the environment is coming underincreasing strain. The international community is facingchallenges going far beyond traditional diplomacy challenges directly affecting the lives of each individualhuman being. We must create safer and better livingconditions for the individual.This year  I will highlight four priority areas: first peacekeeping and international security; secondly  humanrights; thirdly  economic and social development; and fourthly  the environment. In these areas  common effortsin the United Nations are imperative.First  international peace: threats against internationalsecurity and the rights of peoples must be dealt with in theUnited Nations. New complex intra-State conflicts haveincreased dramatically. We must learn from the conflicts inthe former Yugoslavia  Rwanda and Somalia. Millions ofindividuals have suffered in these conflicts. Through theelectronic media  the world closely follows the unfoldingtragedies. The hopes of the victims for a peaceful future areshared by all of us. The United Nations and theinternational community are expected to provide answers.We must focus on the capacity to react directly andquickly and to prevent crises from getting out of hand.Rapid response can be that which separates failure fromsuccess. The creation of the United Nations standby systemwas an important step in the right direction. We must nowtake it one step further.The establishment of a rapidly deployableheadquarters in the Department of PeacekeepingOperations will reduce planning time and response timefor future operations. The planning of new operationscannot start from scratch every time. Denmark continuesits efforts with like-minded countries to establish amultilateral brigade at a state of high readiness within thestandby system. A well-balanced  pre-planned forcestructure will greatly improve the ability to act quicklyand effectively.The need for new conflict strategies was alsounderlined by the Rwanda evaluation initiated byDenmark.Preventive diplomacy is called for. Regionalorganizations must be strengthened to take on moreresponsibility in preventing conflicts and in post-conflictpeace-building. The United Nations cannot carry theentire burden itself. The regional organizations must assistthe United Nations  not replace it.The Organization for Security and Cooperation inEurope (OSCE)  which I shall have the honour andresponsibility of chairing in 1997  is one such importantregional organization. One of the tenets of the OSCE is“OSCE first”. This implies that the OSCE will be aprimary instrument for conflict prevention in its region thus relieving the United Nations.Arms control and arms reduction add theircontribution to conflict prevention. Two and a half yearsof intensive negotiations have resulted in theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) nowopen for signature. On behalf of the Kingdom ofDenmark  I signed the Treaty this morning. The CTBTwill end the qualitative development of nuclear weapons.It is a necessary supplementary component to the Treatyon the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. It willstrengthen progress towards complete global nucleardisarmament.When it comes to conventional weapons  anti-personnel landmines continue to pose a daily  grave threatto people in many parts of the world. They are  at thesame time  an unacceptable obstacle to the resettlement ofdisplaced populations. The new landmine Protocol to theConvention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use ofCertain Conventional Weapons  adopted in May  is animprovement. Denmark will ratify it shortly  withoutreservations  but we are still far away from the onlyviable solution to the landmine problem  which is a total 5worldwide ban. The Danish Government has decided torenounce unilaterally the use of anti-personnel landmines inthe Danish armed forces. We encourage similar decisionsby other Governments.Furthermore  the present state of technology fordetecting unexploded mines is ineffective. Public andprivate initiative  ingenuity and funding must be combinedto create new technological options for landmine detection.The International Conference on Mine-clearanceTechnology  held in Denmark in July this year  hasstimulated this endeavour. We welcome the initiatives ofCanada and Japan to carry the efforts further.National initiatives must be assisted by internationalefforts to speed up mine clearance. To this effect  theGeneral Assembly will be presented with a draft resolutionon assistance in mine clearance.My second priority is human rights. They have cometo play a visible role in international relations and on theagenda of many United Nations forums. The Vienna WorldConference on Human Rights made it clear that thepromotion and protection of all human rights is a legitimateconcern  indeed a duty  of all States and the internationalcommunity. Criticism of human rights abuses can no longerbe rejected as interference in internal affairs. Indeed criticism should be seen as a contribution to our cooperativeefforts to strengthen respect for human rights. The adoptionof international instruments is the result of our cooperation.They are the true universally-accepted bases for continuedprogress in the human rights field.The overall goal is to promote and protect the rightsof individual human beings — our citizens. This leavesroom for each society to find its own way to furtherdemocracy and respect for human rights. No one is tryingto impose a single model. When we freely adhere tointernational human rights standards as our own  we giveup no part of our culture  no part of our nationalsovereignty. On the contrary  individuals enjoying fullhuman rights are the best guarantee of national culture andsovereignty.The United Nations Commission on Human Rightsplays a particularly important role in the promotion ofhuman rights. During its membership term  Denmarkintends to contribute actively to the Commission’s work infour prime areas: the fight against torture; the promotion ofthe rights of indigenous peoples; strengthening the HighCommissioner and his office; and the right to development.Let me in this context pay tribute to the importantcontribution of non-governmental organizations.I cannot mention the area of human rights withoutreferring to the grave situation in Myanmar. It is  indeed a tragedy that  since the release in July last year of NobelPeace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi  developments inthat country have gone from bad to worse.Time and again  Denmark and its European Unionpartners have urged the State Law and Order RestorationCouncil (SLORC) to respect human rights and to restoredemocracy to the Burmese people. Our appeals have beenignored. I repeat them here in the strongest possibleterms. This tragedy must end.I express my deep dismay at the unwillingness of theSLORC to discuss the death in custody  on 22 June 1996of Mr. James Nichols. Mr. Nichols served as honoraryconsul for several European States  including Denmark.The Government of Denmark intends to keep thesituation in Burma high on the international agenda untilfundamental improvements are seen.Economic and social development is the third areaI want to emphasize. Human conflicts have many causes.If we want a lasting foundation for peace in our ownsocieties and internationally  we need to address theproblems of poverty  deprivation and social exclusion.The plight of the poorest countries is a matter ofparticular concern. The United Nations should play acrucial role in addressing this problem.The need for development assistance is as great asever. The poorest countries do not attract privateinvestment. They do not have the potential to benefit fromliberalization of international trade. The current trend inofficial development assistance is deplorable. Officialdevelopment assistance fell to 0.27 per cent of grossnational product in 1995. This is the lowest level sincethe United Nations target of 0.7 per cent was set in 1970.Unfortunately  a number of major donors are stillreducing their development programmes. In 1995  onlyfour countries were above the target of 0.7 per cent.Denmark  for its part  continues to contribute one per centof its gross national product.Economic growth  desirable as it is  cannot beequated with development unless it is accompanied byeconomic and social progress for all groups. Social6progress for all is not an automatic result of economicgrowth. The Declaration and Programme of Action adoptedby the Copenhagen World Summit for Social Developmentstated that“the eradication of poverty  the generation of ...productive employment  and the enhancement of socialintegration” (A/CONF.166/9  p. 24)should be an integral part of policies furthering economicgrowth.I would particularly emphasize the need to ensure aneffective follow-up to the Platform for Action adopted atthe Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing.The United Nations plays a crucial role inhumanitarian assistance. Recent experience  including theRwanda evaluation  has stressed the need for coordinationof all actors in the humanitarian field. The Department ofHumanitarian Affairs of the United Nations has graduallyestablished itself as a focal point for coordination of needsassessment and appeals. I urge all Members of the UnitedNations family with humanitarian assistance programmes toengage actively in DHA-sponsored coordination efforts.The fourth priority area is the environment. TheBrundtland Report and the Rio Conference on Environmentand Development clearly emphasized the global nature ofenvironmental issues. The concept of sustainabledevelopment has now firmly taken its place on our politicalagenda.Much has been achieved. Yet it is uncertain whetherthe accomplishments match the growing problems. Armedconflicts  poverty  ignorance and in some cases even short-sightedness and greed are contributors to the continuedwear and tear on the environment.The special session of the General Assembly  to takeplace in 1997  will be the next opportunity for Governmentsto review at a high level the implementation of Agenda 21.The special session must look at the need for readjusting revitalizing and increasing our efforts to cope with thechallenges.The Government of Denmark fully supports thisprocess. We will continue our support of activities in areasin need  such as safeguarding biodiversity  promotingrenewable energy and reducing erosion  desertification anddeforestation.I have dealt briefly with four high-priority areas. Inthe view of my Government  the United Nations has akey role to play in addressing these problems. But is theOrganization fully capable of taking up this challenge?Regrettably  the answer is no.We must insist that all Members honour their treatyobligations and pay their contributions to the UnitedNations in full  on time and without preconditions. Thepresent state of affairs is unacceptable. Undermining theUnited Nations is in the interest of no one. Members thatare intentionally running behind in paying their assessedcontributions must realize that they cannot expect theirinfluence in the various United Nations organs to remainunaffected.Furthermore  the United Nations must reflect presentpolitical realities. This should be borne in mind in theefforts to agree on reforming the Security Council. Nodoubt  the United Nations must continue its efforts torevitalize itself in the economic and social field. Thequality of its work must continuously be improved. Themain objective is to increase its impact at the countrylevel to the benefit of the poor. Denmark supports acomprehensive and coherent reform of the present systemin areas such as institutions  governance structure  staff administration and future funding.Little can be achieved without the political will ofthe Member States. I agree with the recent findings of atask force sponsored by a well-known Americaninstitution  the Council on Foreign Relations. It states that“the United Nations is in crisis ... principallybecause Members States ... have failed to pay theirbills  have given the United Nations responsibilitieswithout the power to carry them out  and haveblamed the United Nations for failures in nationalpolicies.”In conclusion  let me underline the fundamentalinterest of my country in the establishment of a worldcommunity in which States  as well as each individual may live in conditions of peace and welfare. Well-functioning international organizations  not least our worldOrganization  are cornerstones in this endeavour.Denmark will bring its dedicated contribution."
"47",2005,"DOM",51,1996,"﻿The Dominican Republic wasamong the countries that founded the United Nations. Butthis is only the third time  in 51 years  that its Head ofState has come to address the General Assembly. Perhapsthe reason for this noticeable absence of our country duringthe many years that this great annual event has been heldis that following the Second World War  the internationalsystem revolved around super-Power rivalry  giving rise tothe cold war. In context  it is probable that our leaders feltthat their presence here would have been merely symbolic with no real importance.That this may have been the case in the past  but theworld has changed. From the dramatic transformations inthe geopolitical environment  a multi-polar internationalsystem has emerged  in which the economy matters morethan ideologies and military conflicts. This reorganizationof the international system on the basis of strategiceconomic objectives has been accompanied by a scientificand technological revolution  a revolution of knowledge thatspread across the planet and brought about the mostprofound change ever experienced in the history ofhumankind  turning the world into one large neighbourhood.In the new international order that arose following thecold war  the Dominican Republic could not remainisolated. That is why we are here today: to proclaim to theworld that the Dominican Republic is now actively joiningthe group of nations represented in this multilateralOrganization  so that  through international contacts andexchange  it can contribute to forging a better future forhumanity and  accordingly  a more promising future forDominicans.To ensure our participation in the various forums ofthe United Nations forums  exercising all the rights thathave been bestowed upon us  we proceeded  first  to payour financial debts in full. To the Dominican Republic the payment of our arrears is evidence of our confidenceand faith in the capability of the United Nations to playa role in the international arena to guarantee internationalpeace and security as well as respect for human dignityand fundamental human rights.Nevertheless  just as we understand that the worldhas changed  that there is a new international agendagoverned by the common concerns of all peoples overenvironment preservation  population growth  respect forhuman rights  strengthening of democratic systems recognition of women’s rights  and the social andeconomic development of nations  we also understand thatthis Organization must be renewed and readapted to thenew world circumstances.Latin America and Africa do not have permanentrepresentatives on the Security Council  and Asia has onlyone. This means that there is uneven representation in thatimportant body  which is incomprehensible in anOrganization whose Members enjoy equal footing  on theprinciple that they are all sovereign States. It is ourhumble suggestion that the Security Council should beextended to enable Asia  Africa and Latin America tohave two permanent seats on that body and that thenumber of non-permanent representatives be increased todemocratize the decision-making machinery in that forumfor peace.In one of his most frequently-cited works on theCaribbean  entitled El Caribe  Frontera Imperial  theformer Dominican President and author  Juan Bosch wrote as follows:“The history of the Caribbean is the history ofthe struggle of empires against the peoples of theregion in order to rob them of their rich lands. It isalso the history of the struggle of empires againstone another to rob the possessions each one hadconquered. Lastly  it is the history of the peoples ofthe Caribbean to free themselves from their imperialmasters.”This direct contact with the major Powers over thecourse of five centuries  a product of these confrontations 5has marked the Caribbean  perhaps forever  with aparticular stamp of fragmented histories  and differentcultures and languages. Yet we are always seeking unitywithin diversity.Recent years have brought greater understanding andcloser bonds between us  based on the understanding thatwe have a common destiny. As proof of this  our countryis a founding member of the Association of CaribbeanStates (ACS)  an organization bringing together nations thatare very different both in ethnic terms and in developmentlevels  and thus reflecting the richness and variety of ourregion.We would be pleased to see formal contact with andbacking from the United Nations for that recently createdbody  in support of the efforts we have made to strengthenour relations and to work for our peoples’ development.Similarly  we have been participating in the CaribbeanForum of African  Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) States which is made up of Caribbean countries that benefit fromthe Fourth Lomé Convention. This forum has carried out aseries of regional projects financed with European Unionresources.As an observer  and aspiring full-fledged member  ofthe Caribbean Community and Common Market(CARICOM)  we view with great interest the widening anddeepening relationship between the United Nations andCARICOM. We urge that the necessary steps are be takento intensify the cooperation and coordination between thetwo institutions  which would enable us to achieve ourcommon goals.The countries of the Caribbean are facing thechallenges of current circumstances  as the advantages ofaccess to markets are being eroded because of theimplementation of World Trade Organization agreements the effects of a single European market  the consolidationof the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)and the movement towards reciprocity and similar trends.Our participation in preferential access schemesdepends on the observance of established standards withregard to workers’ rights  human rights  intellectualproperty rights  the environment and civil liberty — mattersthat go beyond economic considerations.We have gained certain advantages from preferentialtrading with the United States and the European Union  asa result of greater prosperity that led to an increase inimport demand from those countries and an increase intourism in the Caribbean. By contrast  we must endure thecomplications of the new rules and harmonizationstandards that have come into force. We have not yettaken full advantage of the benefits deriving from suchconcessional agreements as the Fourth Lomé Convention the Generalized System of Preferences  and the CaribbeanBasin initiative.Our high dependence on foreign trade  the shortagein the supply of goods and services and unsuitablemarketing methods constitute elements of vulnerabilitythat affect  to a greater or lesser extent  all the countriesof the region. We must overcome these limitations anddefine areas in which we can be competitive.Strengthening cooperation is one way to support theCaribbean integration process and rectify suchweaknesses.When referring to the Caribbean  let us not forgetthe situation in Haiti  the country with which we share theisland of Hispaniola. We view with sympathy the processof democratization that is unfolding in that country  andwe appeal to the international community to do its utmostto assist in the huge task faced by the children of thecountry of Toussaint L’Ouverture in constructing a betterfuture for their countrymen.One of the first foreign-policy actions of ourGovernment was to encourage a cooperative and friendlyrelationship between the Dominican Republic and Haiti and we put in place the Joint Bilateral Commission. Aftera fruitful meeting  which took place a few day ago inPort-au-Prince  that Commission agreed to a series oftechnical exchange agreements in the fields of tourism agriculture  trade and investment  sports and border andimmigration matters. Furthermore  we defined theconditions for joint strategies to take advantage of fundsprovided by multinational sources  such as those grantedby the European Union under the terms of the FourthLomé Convention.I would now like to direct the attention of theGeneral Assembly to a subject that just a few years agowas on the front pages of all the newspapers of the worldand that  even though it still has a considerable impact onthe effectiveness of development policies  has vanishedfrom the world’s attention: the problem of foreign debt.The countries of the region have carried out a series ofadjustment programmes in an attempt to regain externalfinancial solvency. Nonetheless  there are stillconsiderable imbalances as a result of the burden of debt6servicing  without a corresponding recovery in the terms ofexchange that would allow us to create greater resourcesthrough our exports.In the case of the Dominican Republic  foreign debtincreased 13-fold between 1964 and 1994. Today  thanks toour extraordinary efforts  our country is now current withits international creditors  which means that we are eligiblefor further external financing. However  being current withour payments to international credit organizations has meantthat our Government has incurred greater social debts to theDominican people. There are fewer resources to invest ineducation  health  housing and social security and ultimately  to deal with the critical situation of poverty thataffects most of our people.In its 51 years of existence  the United Nations hasmade extraordinary efforts to eradicate bellicose conflicts indifferent parts of the world and to contribute to themaintenance of peace and international security. But greathuman sacrifice is inherent in the theatre of war  and ourimpoverished neighbourhoods have adopted the names ofwar-torn places  symbolizing the extent of their fightagainst misery. In the Dominican Republic the poor andmarginalized neighbourhoods have adopted such names asViet Nam  Katanga and Cambodia; none of them  of course is called Sweden  Japan or Germany. This means that thisinternational Organization’s new role is to guaranteeinternational peace and security through mechanisms topromote the economic and social development of the lessfortunate nations.For this reason  with respect to debt  our countrybelieves that multilateral organizations that providedevelopment assistance and the donor Governments together with the debtors  must find more lasting solutionsto the burden of foreign debt servicing  so that we canrelease resources that can immediately be used to fightpoverty and to stop the deterioration of the environment.We have made progress in that regard  and it is fair torecognize that the G-7  the International Monetary Fund  theWorld Bank and the regional banks for developmentassistance  such as the Inter-American Development Bank have consistently designed and implemented importantmechanisms to alleviate the foreign-debt burden  amongwhich the so-called Brady plan and the G-7 programmesfor the reduction of bilateral debt stand out.However  in the near future we will need to reviewsome of the sacred principles prevalent in the internationalfinancial community now for many years  such as thoserelated to the Paris Club cut-off date and the impossibilityof debt restructuring with multilateral organizations. Thisaffects especially the so-called least developed countries which could receive preferential treatment in this regard.The Dominican Republic therefore urges all interestedparties to move forward to enable the underdevelopedcountries to implement viable programmes against povertyand marginalization  within a financially sustainablecontext.In addition to the fight against poverty  at this stageof reforming the international system it is important totake all appropriate measures to fight terrorism and illegaldrug trafficking  scourges that deeply affect the normaldevelopment of mankind. Recently  international drugcartels have tried to use Caribbean routes to carry outtheir illegal operations. The Dominican Republic has beentaking all possible measures to prevent the use of itsterritory as a medium for drug trafficking and drug use.For Dominicans  drug use and trafficking are a nationalsecurity problem  which we will fight with the necessaryforce to eliminate an evil that has become the greatplague of mankind at the end of the twentieth century.In expressing its willingness to play a more activerole in the international system  the Dominican Republicalso expresses its concern at the many unresolvedconflicts in different parts of the world. We advocate adefinitive and peaceful resolution of the conflict in Bosniaand Herzegovina; of the search for peace in Middle Eastbetween the Government of Israel and the PalestineLiberation Organization; of cooperation and assistancewith regard to situations such as those of Somalia Burundi and Liberia. As to the Republic of China onTaiwan  we believe that due to its location in the centreof East Asia  its security and stability bear a close relationwith the peace and prosperity of that region  and wetherefore encourage both the sides along the Taiwan Straitto resume constructive dialogue with a view to achievingmutual cooperation and understanding. We believe thatthe parallel participation of both sides in the UnitedNations would be conducive to maintaining peace.We stand at the threshold of a new century and anew millennium  which will bring new challenges as wellas new opportunities for human progress  and anOrganization such as the United Nations has alwaysserved to stimulate the noblest of human aspirations. TheDominican Republic  trusting in God and in the creativecapacity of its people  aspires to be a spokesman and aninstrument for channelling the ideals of justice  peace 7democracy and prosperity  which inspire the civilizednations of the world."
"48",2052,"DZA",51,1996,"﻿The current session of the United Nations GeneralAssembly is taking place at a complex international time marked by worrisome developments that exacerbate thefeelings of anxiety and precariousness that plague themajority of humanity. These developments result from theprofound historic changes that have occurred in recentyears  which at one time had given us hope for a new andimproved system of international relations that would bemore open to the concerns of all in matters of securityand more receptive to development needs.The transformation of the international economy andaccelerated trends towards globalization have  to be sure resulted in new  more complex relations  but have also due to certain harmful side effects  aggravated theimbalances and the dependency of many developingcountries  whose courageous economic reforms  achievedat the highest of costs  still confront a hostileenvironment.In this new era of heightened interdependence  a lackof solidarity still characterizes international relations  andself-interest is persistent in terms of both security anddevelopment  emphasizing the lack of a mechanism thatcan effectively narrow the growing gap betweendeveloped countries — ever more prosperous andstable — and a developing world faced with poverty anddisorder of every sort.Such observations emphasize that a real awarenesson the part of the international community as a whole and of the developed countries in particular  is slow incoming. They also confirm that piecemeal measures taken on an urgent basis  are not enough to compensatefor the lack of an overall approach to the global problemsof our times.22Also quite clear in this regard is the marginalization ofthe mechanisms established to foster  channel and developcooperation  solidarity and joint efforts among nations.It is significant to note that on the heels of ananniversary session at which the commitment of States tostrengthen the authority of the United Nations wasforcefully reaffirmed  the Organization is experiencing oneof its greatest crises  notably due to restrictions on theresources it needs to accomplish its missions — and this ata time when the demands on it have increased and whenexpectations are growing that it will play a larger role inpreserving peace  in promoting and developing internationalcooperation  and in emancipating peoples still underdomination. Hence the need for all States to discharge theirobligations to our Organization  especially since it hasembarked upon a courageous process of restructuring andreform designed to make it an instrument capable ofgenerating and developing dialogue  cooperation andconfidence among nations.It should be noted  in this regard  that democratization transparency and a better balance among its major organsall are requirements and basic objectives for a genuinereform of the institution and for ensuring the restoration ofthe General Assembly’s authority and the functionsconferred upon it by the Charter — also a key objective inorder to enhance the effectiveness of its action and restoreits credibility.Similarly  it is important  within the framework of thequestion of the expansion of the Security Council  to payspecial attention to such crucial aspects as the transparencyof its work  the representation on it of the Member Stateson whose behalf it acts  and the links to be established withthe General Assembly.Algeria  which has made a priority  in its foreignpolicy  of strengthening the credibility and the authority ofthe United Nations  naturally provides continuous politicalsupport and makes varied contributions to its activities  asshown by our participation in the success of certain peace-keeping operations.This is because our Organization remains the mostappropriate framework for realizing our aspirations forshared security and development  at the very time when therealization of the twin Agendas for peace and developmentcalls for respecting and strengthening its authority.Here I should like to pay a well-deserved tribute toour Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. BoutrosBoutros-Ghali  for his vision  his perseverance and thetireless efforts he has been making in the service ofadapting the United Nations to the challenges of thecurrent era. His courage  his commitment  and theambition he has to reinforce the reach and effectivenessof the Organization at a particularly difficult phase in theevolution of international relations have gained him thesupport of the Organization of African Unity and theLeague of Arab States. My country reiterates its supportfor him and wishes him every success at the head of theUnited Nations.The dawning of a better-organized and more stableinternational order requires seeking joint responses to themost dangerous threats to the security and development ofour countries. These responses can emerge only throughjoint undertakings  greater solidarity and an effectivecommitment to combat the most serious consequences ofthe rise in intolerance and extremism and the denial of themost basic principles of humanity.Among these phenomena  international terrorism ismore than ever manifest  in its seriousness as a universalphenomenon  as a threat to the stability of nations and todemocratic values in our societies  and as a new type ofthreat to international peace and security. So combattingterrorism today requires effective internationalmobilization commensurate with the challenges of a keyphenomenon which knows no limits or inviolablesanctuary.It is fortunate that an international awareness of thedangers inherent in this scourge is beginning gradually toemerge. The international response  however  will to alarge extent remain insufficient if it is not reflected inconcrete action in line with three requirements: theestablishment of true international cooperation; a show ofgreater solidarity; and determination commensurate withregularly stated political commitments.In this regard  the fight against terrorism should notbe ambiguous or selective  as it sometimes is. It should bemarked by a constant  unfailing mobilization of efforts todismantle the criminal chain of terrorism  including thosewho are perpetrators  those who are behind them  thevarious political networks and their sources of financingand supply  and the direct or indirect logistical supportgiven by individuals  groups or States. The necessaryconditions should be created for this. In this context Algeria supports the idea of holding an internationalconference on the fight against terrorism.23Promoting more stable and more balanced internationalrelations requires collective effort to improve the situationin areas of tension and conflict which threaten internationalpeace and security. In order to be fruitful  these effortsshould be buttressed by a search for viable  lasting solutionsto these conflicts and by increasing joint efforts andstrengthening existing frameworks for dialogue.From this standpoint  the crisis in Bosnia andHerzegovina was an example of how indecision and lack ofdetermination on the part of the world community cost usa great deal in tragedy and destruction. This long-sufferingcountry is now  to be sure  embarking on the path to peace even if still remains fragile  and strewn with manyobstacles. We venture to hope  however  that its newinstitutional direction will insure for Bosnia andHerzegovina the peace it needs for stability andreconstruction.Furthermore  the promotion of international relationsalso presupposes the strengthening of regional integrationframeworks which today are the hallmark of an emergingnew system of international relations.In its immediate environment  Algeria is activelyparticipating in the establishment and consolidation of jointaction for solidarity and cooperation with its neighbours with which it hopes to develop exemplary good-neighbourlyrelations. In the Maghreb  the identity  aspirations andcommon mission of the peoples of the region  naturally make us desirous of retaining a plan for Maghreb unity asa central element of my country’s policy. This is anirreversible national priority.Algeria’s determination is an expression of faith in thefuture as is the ability of each of the Arab Maghreb Unionpartners to take advantage of the opportunities for relationswhich can be mutually beneficial and which can meet thelegitimate aspirations of our peoples. It is in this context ofa unified  homogenous and strong Maghreb that Algeriahopes to contribute to the beginning of a just and lastingpeaceful settlement of the issue of Western Sahara. It is inthis regard too that Algeria continues to provide politicalsupport and human and financial resources to theSettlement Plan jointly put in place by the United Nationsand the Organization of African Unity (OAU) with a viewto holding a genuine  credible referendum which wouldguarantee the free exercise by the people of Western Saharaof its right to self-determination and independence.Continuing problems encountered in theimplementation of the Settlement Plan  and the uncertaintysurrounding the desired political solution of this conflict require that we redouble our efforts to establish betterconditions for a genuine peace framework. We areconvinced that this will be possible only if each and everyparty fully discharges its responsibilities in theimplementation of the Plan. A rapid solution would onlybe advantageous for the peace and concord to which allpeoples in the region are entitled.This means in particular that the two parties to theconflict — the Kingdom of Morocco and the POLISARIOFront — should become aware that forthright constructive and responsible dialogue can bring a solutionto pending issues at the current stage  and can also helpthem to prepare for the future.This also means that the duty of the internationalcommunity  and of the United Nations in particular should be translated into a more sustained commitmentand presence  and into a continued peace effort in linewith international responsibilities towards the people ofWestern Sahara and their legitimate rights.The establishment of the OAU Mechanism forConflict Prevention  Management and Resolution reflectsthe determination of African leaders to make a decisivecontribution to reducing tensions and settling disputes onour continent. Thanks to this spirit  the painstaking effortsmade by the countries of the Economic Community ofWest African States have opened up promising prospectsfor a settlement of the conflict in Liberia through nationalreconciliation and a return to democratically electedinstitutions.Algeria hopes for a return to calm  reconciliation andnational unity in Burundi  which are so crucial for thewhole region. We continue to encourage all efforts beingmade by the countries of the Great Lakes region.The lack of prospects for a settlement in Somaliaand the international community’s lack of interest areexacerbating the sufferings endured by the civilianpopulation and are a source of great concern to us. Whileit is true that Somalians themselves must make a specialeffort  it is also the duty of the internationalcommunity — through the United Nations  the OAU andthe League of Arab States — to do everything possible tohelp in reconciliation and in the establishment of nationalinstitutions which could earn the embrace and confidenceof all Somalians.In the Mediterranean  Algeria has constantly workedtowards the establishment of a permanent framework for24dialogue and cooperation which would enable the coastalStates  without exception  to address their political  security economic and human concerns. We have always acted witha view to defining a renewed operational machinery whichwould organize and lead a future of stability and progressin the European-Mediterranean theatre. This is whatmotivated Algeria to join the process begun in Barcelona.In our view  this was an initial accomplishment  animportant step towards the establishment of new European-Mediterranean relations based on mutual confidence andjoint actions  which will give tangible content to theindivisibility of security and development in the region.In the Middle East  recent developments have in manyrespects caused us concern and alarm. The Madridconference created a historic opportunity for a peacefulsettlement for the Arab-Israeli conflict. In the name of goodfaith and responsibility  the commitments entered into mustbe respected. Algeria hopes to pursue its contribution to ajust and lasting peace  and renews its commitment to theprincipals adopted by the Madrid conference: land forpeace; the implementation of Security Council resolutions242 (1967)  338 (1973) and 425 (1978); and respect for thenational aspirations of the Palestinian people. Theseprinciples are at the heart of the peace process and the basisfor our participation in it. Algeria believes that there is noalternative to a settlement based on the total withdrawal byIsrael from all Arab territories occupied since 1967 and onthe right of the Palestinian people to the establishment of asovereign State  with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital.Today  it is the duty and the responsibility of theinternational community  and in particular of the co-sponsors of the peace process  to show resolve anddetermination in continuing their efforts to promote thesuccess of the process — a process which has beenjeopardized by Israeli intransigence and back-sliding.The improvement of relations between Arab States andtheir unity constitute an essential pillar of the peaceprocess. The dawning of peace will depend to a large extenton the mobilization of Arab potential and capacity in theservice of peace and to promote relations based on theprinciples of good-neighbourliness  the non-use of force orthe threat of force  and non-interference in the internalaffairs of States. All of us  Algeria included  must reversethe logic of confrontation  which has compromised relationsbetween Arab countries since the Gulf war  and worktowards reconciliation on the basis of respect forinternational law.In this context  the unjustified violations of theindependence  sovereignty  unity and territorial integrity ofIraq require an increased awareness on the part of theworld community of the risks inherent in such practices which are contrary to international law  and of theireffects on the stability of the region. Such violations which Algeria rejects  have only increased the sufferingof the Iraqi people  who have already been sorely tried byseveral years of sanctions which can no longer bejustified.In the same vein  Algeria remains concerned at thecontinuation of sanctions against our sister country  theLibyan Arab Jamahiriya  and by the sufferings theseinvolve for the Libyan people  to which we would like toreiterate our full solidarity. Furthermore  Algeria renewsits support for the restoration of the sovereignty of theUnited Arab Emirates over the Abu Musa islands and theLesser and Greater Tunb islands  which remain underforeign occupation. My country also expresses itssolidarity with Bahrain in the face of the increasedforeign interference and threats to which it has beensubjected.Algeria’s actions with regard to disarmament stemfrom its conviction that the acquisition  stockpiling andincreased sophistication of arms  in particular high-technology weapons and weapons of mass destruction  donot bring security  but undermine the essentialestablishment of confidence among nations. Strengthenedby this conviction  Algeria has shown — through concreteinitiatives taken at the international  regional and internallevels — its commitment to strengthening the processtowards general and complete disarmament by eliminatingweapons of mass destruction. In this regard  we recall ourparticipation in the drafting and adoption of theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty as an initialstage for more substantial measures in this area.Similarly  after having ratified the Convention onchemical weapons and adhering to the nuclear non-proliferation Treaty  on 30 March 1996 Algeria signed asafeguards agreement with the International AtomicEnergy Agency.Acting with similar responsibility  Algeria has helpedAfrican efforts. These led to the adoption on 11 April ofthe Pelindaba Treaty  by which the States Members of theOrganization of African Unity declared Africa a nuclear-free zone. This African momentum should be encouragedby similar efforts to establish new zones  especially in theMiddle East  which remains a legitimate source ofconcern for all Arab countries  in particular with regardto Israeli nuclear potential.25A better structured and more unified internationaleconomic order is a precondition for international peace andsecurity. The globalization of economic  social and politicalproblems  the lack of coordinated management ofinterdependent issues  the increase in global challenges  andthe weakening of national regulatory structures make it evermore necessary to establish new structures for globalmanagement within a framework of true democratization ofinternational relations. In response to these objectives  theinternational community must shoulder more responsibilityfor the many  interdependent links which hold it together;improve its ability for a collective response to the challengeof development; and increase its support for these efforts.The worsening of the external  bilateral andmultilateral debt crisis of developing countries; the erosionand unpredictable nature of resources from export earnings;restrictions on access to markets; the lack of fairness ininternational trade; one-sided views which affectcooperation; and the unilateral nature of the world decision-making process: all these highlight in different ways thevarious obstacles which remain on the path to development.This means that  in order to organize a common futureon a new basis  the international community must makedevelopment a greater concern  promote joint solutions forthe sustained growth of the countries of the South andensure their true integration in the world economy.In this vein  the issue of development financingdeserves special attention in the context of the persistentexternal debt crisis in the countries of the South and thedrying up of funds for cooperation  since the approachestaken to this issue thus far have been questionable  to saythe least. Imaginative and more global solutions must befound to the external debt problem of the countries of theSouth and their access to international financing. It is alsoimportant to include in our vision of development theenormous potential of the expanding world trade expectedfrom the fair and consistent implementation of the UruguayRound agreements.The first Ministerial Meeting of the World TradeOrganization (WTO)  to be held soon in Singapore  will bea good opportunity for the international community to makea clear appraisal of the implementation of these agreementsand to make the necessary corrections for a moresignificant and equitable participation of the countries of theSouth in international trade. It is through its predictability stability  openness and transparency that the new worldtrade system established by the WTO will become a trueand forceful factor for development.The international economic situation is stillcharacterized by gaps that make the future of the worldmore uncertain  given the increase in inequalities and therisk of social rifts they entail. These gaps  which alsoaffect developed countries faced with the severe problemsof adjusting to unemployment and exclusion  show how faced with globalization  international society can onlyfind joint solutions to global problems  particularly thoseof growth and development. It is in Africa  where thesocio-economic situation is evolving more tragically  thatthis dimension can be seen in all its gravity with theexpansion of abject poverty  the spread of disease and thethreat of impending famine.It is on that continent that we find the greatestexpression of the categorical need for renewed andstrengthened international solidarity in a spirit of open-mindedness and partnership to help African countries intheir efforts at the socio-economic restructuring necessaryto lay the foundations for lasting political and socialbalance and to open new prospects of hope for theirpeoples. It is in fact politically unacceptable and morallyintolerable to continue to ignore the international threatinherent in the deterioration of the development crisis onthat continent.In this vein  the new appeal made last March by theSecretary-General through a special initiative of theUnited Nations system for Africa deserves our fullsupport  since it compels the international community and  in particular the wealthy countries  to face up to theirbasic responsibilities to our continent.In a world that is constantly changing  we mustundertake in all diligence and determination to worktogether to set new balances  enable mankindharmoniously to manage its interdependence and make theinternational economic environment more conducive todevelopment.By its very nature and unique mission  the UnitedNations is the appropriate place to give an articulate  jointglobal response to these challenges. Who better than theUnited Nations can carry out such a task at a time whenmanaging interdependence is more than ever at the heartof the problems of development and peace?26That is why we should come to an agreement on thedevelopment programme proposed by the Secretary-General. This programme should support United Nationsefforts for Africa. This is why the criteria for streamliningand efficiency which accompany the reform process in theUnited Nations system in the economic and social spheresshould be made manifest in a joint quest for commonobjectives in organizing the new system of internationalrelations. It is by doing so and by finding furtherinspiration in its Charter that the United Nations will avoiddrifting off track and will become a more effectiveinstrument for the orderly reconstruction of internationalrelations and thereby provide the necessary stability forpeace and development."
"49",2099,"ECU",51,1996,"﻿I wish to extend to President Razali IsmailEcuador’s warm congratulations on his election  which is atribute to his valuable contributions to the work of ourworld Organization in his capacity as PermanentRepresentative of Malaysia. I wish also to convey ourthanks to Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral  President of theGeneral Assembly at its fiftieth session  for the fruitfulwork he accomplished.I wish to express to the delegation of Bulgaria theheartfelt condolences of the Government of Ecuador forthe irreparable loss it has suffered with the killing offormer Prime Minister Lukanov. Our condolences go alsoto the family and friends of that eminent man.On the threshold of the twenty-first century  weremain immersed in a process of profound change on theinternational scene  resulting from the end of theideological confrontation between East and West. We areseeing the emergence of new opportunities for peace-building  for the strengthening of development  for thediffusion of democracy and for stepped-up internationalcooperation  especially politically. Ecuador believes thatwe should take maximum advantage of these positivefactors and use them as a basis on which to devise themost ambitious programme possible for the coming years with the goal of a world of equity and justice  a world inwhich future generations can live well  in secureconditions  at peace with themselves and with theenvironment on which their very survival depends.In these circumstances  the essential objective of ourOrganization  as established in the Charter  remains thesame: the maintenance of international peace and security.To attain this objective  it is imperative that all MemberStates reaffirm their faith in the purposes and principlesenshrined in the Charter. Most fundamentally  this meansbanning the threat or use of force against the territorialintegrity or the political independence of any State  aswell as the obligation to settle international disputesexclusively by peaceful means. The larger goal ofinternational security should be seen as embracing thepolitical  economic and social conditions in which allnations develop.While the danger of worldwide nuclear destructionhas receded  Ecuador continues to maintain thatpreventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons is not anend in itself  but an intermediate step towards the ultimateobjective of totally banning and completely destroying allnuclear weapons. Ecuador regrets that the Conference onDisarmament was unable to adopt by consensus theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). It takesthe view  however  that the text supported by most States which has been endorsed by the General Assembly andopened for signature by States  is an important steptowards that objective. Ecuador has signed thatinstrument. Although it is not the ideal instrument forwhich the Conference on Disarmament was striving  itwould be a mistake to start this long and arduous processall over again. Ecuador will also continue to work for21general and complete disarmament  which will eliminateonce and for all the grave danger inherent in weapons ofmass destruction and end the squandering of scarce nationalresources on weapons.Ecuador voted in favour of resolution 49/75 K  bywhich the General Assembly requested the InternationalCourt of Justice to issue an Advisory Opinion as to whetherinternational law authorizes the threat or use of nuclearweapons in any circumstances. We welcome the Court’sunanimous finding that“There is in neither customary nor conventionalinternational law any specific authorization of thethreat or use of nuclear weapons.”The finding also states that“A threat or use of force by means of nuclearweapons that is contrary to Article 2  paragraph 4  ofthe United Nations Charter and that fails to meet allthe requirements of Article 51  is unlawful.”In its finding  the Court also expresses the view that“There exists an obligation to pursue in good faith andbring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nucleardisarmament in all its aspects under strict andeffective international control.”The Government of Ecuador believes that the GeneralAssembly should endorse these views  which form a basisfor the continued work of the international community tobring about the definitive banning of nuclear weapons.Terrorism in all its forms and manifestations;organized international crime; and the production consumption and trafficking of all illicit drugs continue topose grave threats that undermine international stability andthe security and well-being of society in general. Toeradicate these evils  we need a coordinated and persistentinternational effort in which all States should be involved in accordance with their capacity and with their degree ofresponsibility. In this regard  Ecuador is complyingappropriately with its obligations.We are currently experiencing the rapid globalizationand interdependence of the world economy  which requiresthe adoption of rational domestic policies and a favourableinternational economic environment. At present  thepromotion of economic development is reflected in theliberalization of trade agreements and the establishment ofan open multilateral commercial system. This new stateof affairs has favourable effects; however  in certaincircumstances  it produces adverse consequences. For thatreason it is imperative that policies and the internationalenvironment be structured so as to derive maximumbenefit from these trends and minimize the negativeeffects. Ecuador is mindful of this situation  but wouldalso like to stress the need  as expressed by the Heads ofState and Government in the Declaration on the Occasionof the Fiftieth Anniversary of the United Nations  to“Invigorate the dialogue and partnership between allcountries in order to secure the existence of afavourable political and economic environment forthe promotion of international cooperation fordevelopment based on the imperatives of mutualbenefit and interest and genuine interdependence while recognizing that each country is ultimatelyresponsible for its own development”. (resolution50/6  para. 8)In this regard  direct foreign investment in developingcountries is particular important because it accelerates theeconomic process to the benefit of both the investors andof the recipient economies.The United Nations should continue to be animportant catalyst in support of the economic and socialdevelopment of the developing countries and of thedisadvantaged and marginalized sectors. The worldOrganization has sponsored global conferences to addressvital problems related to the environment  population social development  crime  the advancement of women the protection of the family  human settlements  trade anddevelopment  and public administration. Therecommendations and initiatives adopted at thoseconferences have set genuine priorities for theinternational community in the promotion of development.Nevertheless  what has been achieved to date in many ofthese fields is still uneven and insufficient. Therefore Ecuador reaffirms that  in order to effectively implementthese decisions  there needs to be a rapid mobilization ofthe resources for development  as well as a more efficientuse of those resources. Without such an internationalcommitment  all the conferences’ recommendations andother similar pronouncements will only enlarge theoverloaded archives of our foreign ministries. Given thepersistence of such environmental problems as the lack ofdrinking water  threats to biological diversity  thedepletion of the ozone layer  the warming of theatmosphere  the diminishing soil productivity desertification and diminishing food security 22Governments of both industrialized and developingcountries must take joint  concerted action.Ecuador  faithful to its democratic traditions  hasrecently provided an example of a transparent electoralprocess and of respect for the popular will. As a result President Abdalá Bucaram was elected to lead the country and for the first time in Ecuadorian history  a woman  Mrs.Rosal'a Arteaga  has been elected Vice-President of theRepublic. The new Administration’s first and principalactions are focused on social policies  especially oncombating poverty and on a wide-ranging nationalprogramme of low-cost housing.Given its faith in the will of the people  Ecuadorwelcomes the growing trend towards democratization: moreand more countries have adopted multi-party systems organized free and fair elections and begun to transformthemselves into more open and participative societies.However  Ecuador also believes that this process does nothappen spontaneously but requires the understanding andsupport of the international community so as to create andsustain conditions conducive to such changes. In otherwords  democracy and hunger are antithetical elements thatcannot exist together.The Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action —which is steadily gaining practical force andeffectiveness — reaffirm the solemn commitment of allStates to promote and protect all human rights andfundamental freedoms. The interrelationship between humanrights  democracy and development articulated in thatDeclaration and Programme  calls for a comprehensive andglobal approach to ensure the promotion and protection ofhuman rights.In the Declaration on the Occasion of the FiftiethAnniversary of the United Nations  the Heads of State andGovernment reaffirmed that all human rights are universal indivisible  interdependent and interrelated. They made acommitment  among other things  to protect all humanrights and fundamental freedoms; to strengthen laws policies and programmes to secure the full and equalparticipation of women in all spheres of political  civil economic  social and cultural life; to promote and protectthe rights of the child; to ensure protection of the rights ofpeople who are particularly vulnerable  including youngpeople  the disabled  the elderly and migrant workers; andto promote and protect the rights of indigenous populations.Ecuador considers that human rights has become one of themost important spheres of United Nations action. Itsupports the work of the United Nations HighCommissioner for Human Rights in his efforts to carryout this broad and important programme of activities.It should be recalled that economic and socialproblems are not restricted to the most disadvantagedcountries. A number of societies are seriously threatenedby increasing external debt  the instability of theinternational financial system  persistent unemployment intractable poverty and increasingly destructive waves ofcrime and corruption. The inequality gap betweendeveloped and developing countries remains unacceptablylarge and continues to widen. More than 1 billion peoplelack drinking water  and 1.7 billion do not have access toproper health facilities. This means that poverty continuesto affect more than one fifth of the world’s population.Hunger  malnutrition  health problems  a total lack ofhousing  limited access to education and other publicservices and resources  social exclusion  alienation andviolence are only a few of the many factors associatedwith poverty. The fight against this scourge is one of thegreatest challenges that the United Nations and itsspecialized agencies must face in close cooperation withnon-governmental organizations and the internationalcommunity as a whole. Since 1990  commitments havebeen made and goals established  with a view toachieving the overall objective of eradicating poverty inpartnership with all the actors associated withdevelopment. In this context  and from this lofty rostrum Ecuador would like to issue an urgent appeal to allMember States to intensify international cooperation  inits many aspects  in order to fight vigorously together toensure that these commitments and goals have practicaland effective application. We must remember that povertyis not only a malady which destroys the societies directlyaffected  it is also a corrosive contagion that preventsinternational relations from developing on a basis ofjustice and equity.Ecuador is a multi-ethnic country with sizeable andimportant indigenous groups and significant blackminorities. For this reason  it considers that theInternational Decade of the World’s Indigenous People declared by this General Assembly  establishes aprogramme of action that will restore the rights of thosepeoples  which have systematically been victims of a longhistorical process of exclusion and discrimination. Webelieve it is incumbent on the entire internationalcommunity to build universal understanding of the factthat protecting those populations also means preservingthe cultural heritage of humankind. Ecuador trusts that itcan rely on international cooperation in order to23appropriately fulfil its obligation in this respect  incoordination with its national programmes.The founders of the United Nations must have realizedthat they could not foresee exactly what the world would belike 50 years hence. On the other hand  they establishedbasic objectives and principles and incorporated them in aCharter that is sufficiently flexible to enable theOrganization to serve its peaceful objectives and to evolvein response to new challenges. This is why the Charter  andits purposes and principles  has endured. However  today’schanged circumstances  which determine the functioning ofthe United Nations  demand a modification in the structureand the operational practices of our Organization. It isnecessary  among other things  to increase the UnitedNations capacity to prevent conflicts through preventivediplomacy  peacekeeping and peacebuilding. We need betterways and means to respond to the challenges of emergencysituations. And  along with all of this  it is essential to fullycarry out the work of economic and social development.The General Assembly must be revitalized as the pre-eminent organ in which all Member States exercise on anequal footing their rights and duties as set forth in theCharter. Equitable representation in the Security Councilmust be assured  and its size must be in proportion with thenumber of Member States. It must cease being an elitistorgan with antidemocratic privileges  and the efficiency andtransparency of its work must be enhanced. The Economicand Social Council must regain its essential originalfunctions as set out in the Charter: primarily  to promotewell-being and to improve living standards for all theinhabitants of the Earth. The current financial crisis isseriously affecting the United Nations ability to fulfil thelofty objectives set forth in the Charter. The greatestdebtors should set an example of their readiness to fulfiltheir obligations. Only if there is a general willingness toprovide the United Nations with the resources it needs  aswell as the necessary political support  will it be possiblefor the global Organization to live up to the trust and hopesthat humankind has vested in it.I wish to inform the General Assembly that since thelast session  as regards the peacemaking process beingcarried out pursuant to the Itamaraty Declaration betweenEcuador and Peru  and with the participation of theguarantor countries — Argentina  Brazil  Chile and theUnited States — several meetings have taken place at boththe diplomatic and military levels. At these there has beensignificant progress  progress that my delegation regards asconducive to finalizing the procedures for discussions onthe substance of the border dispute between the twocountries. The Government of Ecuador will continue towork towards the achievement of the ultimate goal  whichis no less than a fair  definitive and honourable solutionto the problem."
"50",2144,"EGY",51,1996,"﻿This session is being held amid a very sensitive anddelicate international situation which is generallycharacterized by political and socio-economic concerns.This is particularly evident all over the developing world which is overpopulated and simultaneously overburdenedwith problems of backwardness and the challenges ofdevelopment. The hopes that were raised with the end ofthe cold war  heralding the advent of a new era in whichcooperation and détente would prevail  soon were shatteredin the midst of these problems and these concerns. We arecurrently facing conflicting phenomena  where elements ofcomplementarity and integration coincide with tendenciestowards division and disunity. The technology andcommunications revolution runs parallel to the eruption ofnational conflicts and ethnic animosities. Ambitions ofleadership overlap practices of hegemony. This has createda serious conceptual confusion which the internationalorder  in its current form  cannot address in an effective ordeterring manner. Indeed  this order  due to its obviousdouble standards  might have contributed to theintensification of the era’s negative aspects at the expenseof its positive aspects and gains.Certainly  the logic of evolution and the rules oftransformation indicate that the stages of change carrywithin them a potential risk as well as elements of rivalry unless an objective and conducive environment exists accompanied by a forward-looking vision and a set ofhighly advanced values that are crystallized throughcoordinated and concerted efforts. This is precisely whatdid not happen. The dichotomy between the North and theSouth is widening. The lack of common understandingamong world cultures and civilizations is still present.This has caused discord in world thinking and createdmutual suspicions that not only pose an overwhelmingthreat  jeopardizing the march of political progress andthe activities of economic development as well as thefabric of social development  but also have raisedquestions as to whether the benefits of science andtechnology lead to world security and stability  or quitethe opposite.In connection with contemporary internationalpolitics  it is really most alarming that attempts are beingmade to marginalize the United Nations at a time whenthe world is in need of further understanding  bettercoordination and accelerated interdependence. It wouldhave been more logical to call for the strengthening ofthis Organization  so that it could perform its role inachieving these objectives in a truly democratic manner with the participation of all the countries of the worldwith their diverse cultures  societies  sizes  orientationsand achievements. This is particularly true since theUnited Nations Charter  in our view — a view shared bymany others — still represents a major instrumentgoverning international life  and since any internationalorder  be it old or new  must be based on a solidfoundation that respects rights  determines obligations andopens the door to an era of interaction among societies onthe basis of acceptance and understanding  not impositionor oppression.We are definitely aware that the challenges oftomorrow are different from those of yesterday. We arealso aware that the United Nations  in its current culture may not be able  one way or another  to deal with futurechallenges. However  this must be a subject for discussionto build consensus among us  not a matter to bedetermined by a few or to be decided unilaterally.For these reasons  it is imperative to strivecollectively to build a common political will to strengthenthe United Nations  to enhance its effectiveness and torestore its credibility in order to maintain world stabilityand security.The annals of this Organization abound withhistorical achievements and it continues to make progressin dealing with the problems of our world. An in-depthreading of the Secretary-General’s reports on political 17economic and social situations in the world reassures us ofthis role and we urge that it be upheld  because it addressesthe present and explores the prospects for the futurethrough global understanding.The Secretary-General’s role in developing a rationalbasis for worldwide development activities has succeededin focusing attention on the issues of our times through aseries of conferences held over the past five years on theenvironment  human rights  population  social development women and human settlements. These represent importantreference points for global action based on internationalconsensus in dealing with problems that were once marginalbut are today substantial. We call on the Secretary-Generalto pursue this approach  which allows the United Nationsto stand out in a distinctive and positive way in a world ofgrowing negativity.A strengthened role  reform and enhanced efficiencyare our common objectives for the United Nations. Thehistoric Declaration issued last year by the Heads of Stateand Government on the fiftieth anniversary of the UnitedNations constitutes a cornerstone for the future work of theOrganization. The Declaration contained a clear conceptualframework for global action on the basis of the prioritiesupon which we all agreed: peace based on the principlesand provisions of the Charter and supported by an effectiveregime of collective security; development in all its aspectsin the social and economic fields; sovereign equality amongStates and respect for peoples’ rights; and justice inaddressing the various issues on the international agenda.Egypt deems it necessary to translate these noble principlesinto clear programmes of action that take into considerationthe interests of all without discrimination.When we met here last year to celebrate the UnitedNations fiftieth anniversary  we were dismayed by theevents in the Great Lakes region in Africa  wherehorrendous massacres had left a painful humanitarianlegacy. We were disturbed by the events in Bosnia  whereUnited Nations “safe areas” had been overrun and innocentpeople had lost their lives in despicable ethnic strife.However  we were optimistic at that time aboutdevelopments in the Middle East. The Interim Agreementhad been signed between President Yasser Arafat and thelate Prime Minister of Israel  Yitzhak Rabin  and describedas an important step on the path to finding a solution to thequestion of Palestine. Has the situation changed or evolvedfor the better?Let us look into last year’s developments in thatregion. In recent months  the Middle East has undergone acrisis that has almost stifled the peace process  a crisisresulting from the reluctance of the Israeli Government toact in keeping with the agreed fundamentals of peace.This position has threatened a return to the language concepts  policies and even practices that were on the eveof extinction in the region. Thus  action on all peacetracks was deadlocked and the peace process stagnated.This prompted Egypt  which initiated that process andbelieves in a just and balanced Arab-Israeli peace  tointensify efforts to rectify the situation and consolidate thefundamentals of this process  first among which is the“land for peace” principle.In this context  I would like to put forward the Arabposition as contained in the final communiqué of thesummit held in Cairo last June. The attending Arableaders unanimously expressed their keen interest in thecontinuation of the process of making a just andcomprehensive peace an Arab strategic option underinternational legality. This Arab position requires acorresponding commitment  seriously and unequivocallyundertaken by Israel  to abide by the principles agreedupon at the Madrid Conference  particularly the “land forpeace” principle and the assurances provided to theparties. The Arab leaders stressed that any breach byIsrael of these principles or of the bases in which thepeace process is anchored; any reneging on thecommitments  undertakings or agreements made in theframework of this process; or any procrastination in theirimplementation would set back the peace process  with allthe risks and repercussions involved. This could replungethe region into an atmosphere of tension and would forceall Arab countries to reconsider the steps taken vis-à-visIsrael within the framework of the peace process. In sucha case  the Israeli Government alone would assume fullresponsibility.The Arab leaders emphasized that there would be norecognition or acceptance of any situation resulting fromIsraeli settlement activity in the occupied Arab territories since the settlements are considered an illegal measurethat entails no rights and establishes no obligations. Theestablishment of settlements and the bringing in of settlersviolate international law and the Madrid framework andimpede the peace process  which requires Israel to halt allsettlement activities in the occupied territories. The Arableaders also emphasized that a just and comprehensivepeace in the Middle East can be achieved only through aresolution of the questions of Al-Quds and the Palestinianrefugees on the basis of their rights of return and tocompensation  in accordance with international legalityand United Nations resolutions.18A short while ago  the new Israeli Prime Minister metwith the Palestinian President. Undoubtedly  their meetingrepresents progress towards their mutual recognition aspartners on an equal footing in the Palestinian-Israeli peaceprocess. In theory  the peace process should proceed toimplement the commitments made under the Oslo Accordsin accordance with the agreed timetable  but that has notyet happened.We are interested not in handshakes or wide smiles forphoto opportunities  but rather in substantive developments.Thus  what is required and what we should all strive for isthe implementation of commitments  serious negotiation andtime well spent. We call upon the entire world to follow upthe matter with us with full vigilance and to allow neitherretrogression nor the manipulation of very sensitive andserious matters  namely  the establishment of a permanentcontractual peace between Palestine and Israel that fulfilsthe national aspirations of the Palestinian people andculminates in their exercise of their right to self-determination under international supervision and theestablishment of a Palestinian State. This peace must alsoachieve security for Israel and all parties on an equalfooting.Israel is called upon to desist from its settlementpolicy  including the expansion of settlements  and to endits policies of closing territories and besieging thePalestinian people. It is called upon to honour itscommitments  redeploy its troops outside Hebron andresume without further delay the final status negotiations.Israel is also called upon to put an end to its practices inAl-Quds  a city where any rights that could be claimed byIsrael are outweighed by Arab rights  which are moreancient  legitimate and authentic than any Israeli claim tothe city.On the Syrian track  I can say in all honesty and withfull confidence that Syria is ready to resume thenegotiations suspended last February at Israel’s request. Thenegotiations should resume at the point at which theystopped  which is fair  and in accordance with the Madridframework and the principle of “land for peace“  which isright.From this rostrum  Egypt calls for the resumption ofthese negotiations. Israel must refrain from pursuingpolicies and formulations that may be interpreted assquandering years of negotiations and that constitute aregression from principles that have become an integral partof the rules for peaceful work in the region and are backedby international legality and supported by broadinternational consensus.On the Lebanese track  we call for theimplementation of Security Council resolution 425 (1978)and Israel’s full withdrawal from Lebanon  to whichIsraeli officials have repeatedly stated they have noterritorial claim.Peace in the Middle East will not be comprehensiveor lasting until a strict regime for regional security isestablished  based on arrangements that provide equalsecurity for all parties with minimum levels of armament.The region must be totally free from all weapons ofmass destruction — nuclear  chemical and biological —and their delivery systems. Peace and security cannotsurvive in the presence of any instability in the balance ofpower or serious discrepancy in the rights and obligationsof the countries of the region.Furthermore  we are closely watching the hugeIsraeli arsenal  which includes weapons of massdestruction  missiles and anti-missile weapons. Wewonder about the rationale behind it. We believe that ithas  indeed  led to a reaction by a number of countries inthe region to this serious escalation  at a time when weare all talking of peace. Given this fact — or  rather  toavoid its consequences — Egypt proposes the initiation ofeffective negotiations to establish a zone free from allweapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems.President Hosni Mubarak has been making such aproposal since April 1990.Egypt calls upon the permanent members of theSecurity Council and the depositary States of the Treatyon the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) which sponsored and adopted the resolution on theMiddle East during the Review and Extension Conferenceof the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation ofNuclear Weapons  to take specific steps to establish anuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East inaccordance with the Egyptian initiative  which hasenjoyed the consensus of all the States concerned since1980.While Egypt stresses the fact that arms control andregional security constitute one of the pillars of peace andstability in the Middle East  it also believes that economicand regional cooperation under a just peace constitutesanother such pillar. Regional cooperation is inseparablefrom the establishment of peace: peace is its essence and19its framework. Two sessions of the Middle East-NorthAfrica Economic Summit have been held  in Casablancaand in Amman  the capital of Jordan. Both were held in anatmosphere of optimism that the peace process wouldsucceed. Indeed  there have been some successes  such asthe signing of the interim agreement between Israel andPalestine  and the holding of direct negotiations betweenSyria and Israel. They took place against the background ofa receding settlement policy and continuous discussionabout peace and its objectives. However  today we see theexact opposite. This state of affairs threatens peace  itsframework and all that is associated with it  includingregional cooperation  which can prosper only in anatmosphere of peace and hope for the future. We thereforecall upon Israel to return to the fundamental framework ofpeace in accordance with the agreements concluded  theterms of reference established and the principles approved.While Egypt is in favour of holding the thirdEconomic Summit as scheduled — like others  we have agreat deal to contribute in the fields of economic reform investment and development — we call upon the sponsorsof the peace process  especially the United States  to striveto create the conditions that could lead to the successfulconvening of the Summit. That can be achieved only bymaking serious endeavours on all peace tracks  in terms ofboth negotiation and implementation. We are making thisdeclaration before the entire international community  sothat every party will discharge its responsibilities andhonour its commitments. If they do not  the balance will bedisturbed and the issue will become meaningless.Peace in the Middle East is contingent upon justice balance and honesty in negotiating and addressing the needsof peoples. From this stems the open Egyptian diplomacythat regards the current situation as a matter of utmostseriousness. We once again reiterate that Egypt rejects anymeasure that results in an unbalanced peace that satisfiesthe interests of one party at the expense of another. Thepeace that we aspire to is a balanced Arab-Israeli peace thatreciprocates right for right  security for security  andcommitment for commitment.A just and comprehensive peace is the cornerstone ofstability in the Middle East. Despite the unpropitiousattitude of the new Israeli Government to the peace process right alone will eventually prevail. Peace will impose itself propelled by the desire of the peoples of the region including the people of Israel  to live in genuine peace cooperation and stability.Egypt  whose people contributed to laying thefoundations of human civilization  has for centuriesaccepted and continues to accept the imperatives ofgeography and history  which give Egypt specialresponsibilities for the affairs of our region and beyond.Egypt takes the initiative for peace  seeks prosperity prompts enlightenment and is steadfastly involved inadvancing the march of progress.Egypt therefore empathizes with the agony of theregion and the repercussions of developments there.While peace in the Middle East is at a crucial stage  theGulf region  which is part of the Middle East  is alsoundergoing a number of unfavourable developments. Thestability of the Gulf region is  for more than one reason linked to the ultimate interests of Egypt and its security.In particular  it is an area endowed with a potential andwith characteristics that make its stability and security amatter of significance to all Powers concerned withinternational peace and security.The result of our review of the succession of eventsin this area leads us to several conclusions. First  strictcompliance with Security Council resolutions on Iraq without fail or divergences  is the only way to guaranteethe end of the crisis that erupted in August 1990.Secondly  the use of force cannot restore rights or rectifywrongs. Thus  the rights of the Iraqi people  themaintenance of its unity and respect for the rights andwell-being of Iraqis  whether Arabs or Kurds  will remainthe major concern of all of us. We are equally concernedwith safeguarding the rights of the people of Kuwait andthe return of detainees and property.Thirdly  the memorandum of understanding on theoil-for-food resolution  which was reached after arduousnegotiations  must be put into effect without any furtherdelay to alleviate the suffering of our brothers  the Iraqipeople.Fourthly  compromising territorial integrity and theunity of Iraq is not only a breach of international law butwill open the door to major repercussions underminingregional stability and threatening the interests ofneighbouring countries.Fifthly  the withdrawal of Iran from the three islandsof the United Arab Emirates — Abu Musa  Tunb asSughra and Tunb al Kubra — is a sine qua non conditionfor defusing another hotbed of tension. The Arab call toIran to settle amicably any territorial claims to thoseislands is still valid.20Sixthly  the policy of intervention and the attempts tomanipulate ethnic and religious minorities to destabilizeother neighbouring countries cannot help to establishstability in the Gulf region or the wider region of theMiddle East  or help ensure the interests of any of theparties concerned  in addition to its being a flagrantviolation of the rules of international conduct.Before leaving the issue of the Middle East  I wouldlike to refer to the dispute between Libya and someWestern countries  a dispute to which we attach particularimportance because of its repercussions for the region aswell as the damage and suffering it inflicts on our brothers the people of Libya  on the economies of the neighbouringcountries and on the stability of the region in general. Inview of our keen interest in averting an escalation of theproblem and in expediting the attainment of an earlysettlement  we support the efforts and initiatives made bythe League of Arab States  the Organization of AfricanUnity (OAU) and the Non-Aligned Movement  and call fora positive response to those efforts and initiatives.Moving from the Middle East to Africa  we findstories of success and of failure — pictures both bleak andbright. While our sister country Rwanda has restored itsstability and launched its reconstruction and development its neighbour  our sister Burundi  is an example of the realturmoil which is affecting the entire Great Lakes region.Last year we expressed our extreme dismay at the situationin this important region; today we reiterate this  and stressthe need for the Security Council to discharge itsresponsibilities to avert the recurrence of Rwanda’s tragedyin Burundi.There is  however  a positive element that we hopewill not be lost in the disappointment over the deterioratingsituation in Africa: the efforts of the OAU  which havestarted to take shape within an institutional framework thatwe hope will be successful. This was embodied in theestablishment of the Mechanism for Conflict Prevention Management and Resolution  which will play a role inresolving the problems of the continent. The countries andthe leaders of the Great Lakes region  particularly formerPresident Nyerere  have played a laudable collective role inreconciliation  dealing with the question of refugees and therampant ethnic rivalries in the region. Serious efforts werealso made by the Economic Community of West AfricanStates (ECOWAS) to settle the Liberian problem particularly by Nigeria  which has made continuing effortsduring its current chairmanship of that subregional group.We commend the efforts made by Ghana during itschairmanship of ECOWAS over the past two years. We callon the international community  and the United Nationsin particular  to support all of these efforts and to providethe necessary means for their success.This applies also to the numerous efforts made toachieve national reconciliation in Somalia  theimplementation of the Lusaka Protocol in Angola and thesettlement plan in Western Sahara. We hope that theparties concerned will benefit from these historicopportunities  so that stability will prevail in Africa andso that international support for these efforts willcontinue  particularly in terms of post-conflictrehabilitation and socio-economic reconstruction.In this context  I should like to draw attention to thegravity of the continued deterioration of the socio-economic situation in the African continent  whichincludes two-thirds of the world’s least-developedcountries; one-third of its population is facing starvation.Despite this fact  the countries of the continent aretenaciously striving towards economic reform  structuraladjustment  strengthening regional cooperation amongthemselves and dealing with the social situation in thecontinent in accordance with the Declaration issued inCairo in March 1995.These efforts are still faltering as a result ofdiminishing international support and a lack of necessaryfinancial resources. Thus we support the United NationsSystem-Wide Special Initiative for Africa presented lastMarch by the Secretary-General based uponcomprehensive mobilization of resources and fullparticipation of international institutions. Hence  we callupon donor countries and upon the internationalcommunity to take the necessary measures to deal withthe critical economic situation in Africa  particularly theexternal debt problem  by providing the necessaryresources and creating an environment that will enable thecontinent to join the march of development and to be ableto address its socio-economic problems  which representone of the root causes of political tension and instabilitythere.The critical economic situation in Africa leads us tovoice some of the concerns of Egypt and the developingcountries vis-à-vis the world’s economy. Suffice it here tomake a reference to the importance of the faithfulimplementation of the Uruguay Round agreements and thenecessity to address the negative impact on the net foodimporting countries. We look forward to the success ofthe first ministerial conference of the World TradeOrganization (WTO)  to be held in Singapore. We would21like to highlight the importance of focusing on theimplementation of the Uruguay Round agreements withoutattempting to raise new issues such as those pertaining toinvestment and the linkage between international trade  onthe one hand  and labour and environment  on the other.Any proposed additional issues should be subject to in-depth study. We reiterate the leading and important role ofthe United Nations Conference on Trade and Development(UNCTAD) in this regard prior to bringing such issues tothe WTO for consideration.Turning to Bosnia  there is hope of implementing theDayton agreement to put an end to the appalling tragedycaused by “ethnic cleansing” and racist narrow-mindedness.The agreement will be implemented under internationalprotection  represented by the Implementation Force(IFOR)  to which Egypt and numerous other countriescontribute. Despite all the circumstances associated with theelection process  its results are still a source of optimism inthe possible victory of the forces of moderation so thatBosnia can become a multi-ethnic State where Serbs Muslims and Croats live together in peace.Egypt welcomes the election of President Izetbejovicas President of the tripartite Presidential Council. In thisrespect we would like to stress a number of points whichwe think can guarantee the stability of the situation andensure full compliance with the provisions of the Daytonagreement. First  it is important to consolidate the territorialintegrity of Bosnia  to reject vehemently and strictly anyattempts at partition and to respect the democratic processand the results of elections. Secondly  it is necessary toassist the State of Bosnia in completing the necessarycomponents of building its national army and to provide itwith the equipment it needs to deter any external threat orface a new collapse of the internal situation after IFORwithdraws. Thirdly  it is necessary to provide the economicsupport Bosnia needs to rebuild and rehabilitate the country since this will represent support for the foundations ofcoexistence and peace among its three ethnic groups.Fourthly  it is essential to punish the war criminals.Otherwise  talking about human rights in the world will befutile and will be considered as an entrenchment of doublestandards.The phenomenon of terrorism has become exacerbatedand now knows no boundaries. We must all implement theDeclaration on Measures to Eliminate InternationalTerrorism  which was adopted at the forty-ninth session.Terrorists must find no refuge in any civilized country. Wemust all cooperate in uprooting all sources of terrorism. Wemust construct a well-defined legal system that ensures thepursuit of those who are responsible for terrorism  andtheir prosecution and extradition to stand trial for thecrimes they have perpetrated  crimes that terrorizepeaceful people and threaten international stability. Wemust define clear criteria and rules that guarantee that theright of political asylum will not be extended to theundeserving  so that that right will not become a licenceencouraging terrorists and protecting them fromprosecution and punishment.Terrorism is an international phenomenon that is notlinked to a particular geographic region or to a particularcivilization  culture or religion. We have witnessed theevidence  ranging from the Far East to the Middle East to Europe  and to America. Terrorism has even comeclose to this very building. The entire internationalcommunity must harness the necessary resources toconfront this vicious aggressive phenomenon  to eradicateits sources and to isolate whoever provides it withassistance and encouragement. In this respect  I call onthe United Nations and the civilized peoples of the worldto respond swiftly to the call of President Hosni Mubarakto hold an international conference to deal with thecriminal phenomenon of terrorism and  as a contributionto peace and stability in the world at large — to mobilizejoint international efforts to combat it.I began my statement with our perception of the roleof this Organization. I conclude it by paying tribute andexpressing my appreciation to the Secretary-General  Mr.Boutros Boutros-Ghali  whose expertise and insight havecontributed  during his current tenure  to the identificationof problems and challenges facing the internationalcommunity and this Organization. He has drawn up theagenda on items under consideration as well asapproaches for dealing with them. The implementation ofthis agenda is contingent upon the will and the interest ofthe Member States.As it reiterates its confidence in the Secretary-General  a confidence shared by members of two of themost prominent regional organizations — the ArabLeague and the Organization of African Unity — Egyptattaches high priority to seeing him preside over theUnited Nations Secretariat for a second term  duringwhich he will have the chance to lead the Secretariat andto take part in implementing the programmes he devised the reform process he designed and the solutions heinitiated to the problems facing the Organization problems that surface in an international arena witnessingthe birth of a new order whose features are not yetdefined  problems that occur as the United Nations passes22through a historic juncture  on the threshold of a newcentury and a new millennium."
"51",2168,"ERI",51,1996,"﻿Allow me first to congratulateyou  Sir  on your election as President of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-first session. I wish also to pay tributeto your predecessor  Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral ofPortugal  who presided over the fiftieth regular session ofthe General Assembly.The Assembly will agree with me that present-dayinternational relations are characterized by twocontradictory trends. On the one hand  there is anoverriding desire and wilful movement to enhanceinternational cooperation through the expansion of trade andinvestment. This trend is inextricably linked to the pursuitand maintenance of peace and stability. However  parallelwith and contradicting this positive trend  we see aproliferation of high- and low-intensity conflicts in variouscorners of the world triggered by different causes. Thepursuit of viable mechanisms to reduce and seek apermanent solution to these conflicts in order to promoteinternational cooperation for the welfare of mankindremains  therefore  the key challenge that the UnitedNations will continue to face in the coming years.The Horn of Africa region remains  likewise  in thegrips of this dichotomy. On the positive side  thecountries of the region are committed to promotingregional cooperation  and continue to make strenuousefforts to this end. This is indeed manifested by thesubstantial progress achieved to date to revitalize theInter-Governmental Authority on Drought andDevelopment (IGADD)  the regional instrument forachieving this objective. At the same time  the regioncontinues to bleed due to grave internal conflicts withinsome member States. The painful bloodletting that hasdestroyed the social fabric in Somalia continues unabated;the internal conflict in the Sudan and the climate ofregional tension created by the activities of the NationalIslamic Front (NIF) regime continues to deteriorate.The pursuit of peace and stability  with the attendantopportunities that this provides for economic and socialdevelopment  have special significance for peoples thathave suffered the physical and psychological traumas ofwar. In this connection  as the Assembly is aware  mycountry has borne the brunt of a long war which hasexacted enormous human sacrifices  leaving its economicand social infrastructure a shambles. Accordingly  peaceis crucial to the young State of Eritrea to heal the scars ofwar  to recoup lost opportunity and to reconstruct whathas been devastated.But my Government’s profound aspirations andcommitment to the maintenance of peace continue to bethreatened by the hostile and unprovoked acts of the NIFregime in the Sudan  whose antagonism and subversionagainst Eritrea began soon after it took power in 1989. Ihardly need emphasize here that the acts of subversion andState-sponsored terrorism are not directed against Eritreaalone  but have in fact been adopted as an instrument ofpolicy by the NIF in its attempts to destabilize itsneighbours and export its expansionist designs throughsubversion and violence.In pursuit of these aims  the NIF regime has proppedup and provided safe haven to assorted terrorists fromvarious countries and facilitated their acts of sabotage andterror. Khartoum’s barely veiled hand is discernible fromthe litany of border incursions by mercenary groups in anumber of countries in the region and acts of naked terrorin the international arena.I must stress here that my Government has left nostone unturned in its efforts to reduce and stave off theclimate of tension provoked by the acts of the NIF regime.As a matter of fact  for five long years my Governmentpursued a policy of constructive engagement  patiently andtirelessly  hoping against hope that the authorities inKhartoum would turn back from the dangerous alley thatthey are heading for.Unfortunately  the language of moderation and peaceonly whetted the NIF’s appetite to spread its subversivetentacles deeper and wider. In the event  Khartoum not onlyrefused to heed these continuous appeals  but escalated itsovert acts of terror and subversion beyond limits.Another grave matter I wish to bring to the attentionof this Assembly is the maltreatment of Eritrean refugeesat the hands of Sudanese authorities. The NIF regime notonly is doing whatever it can to obstruct the organizedrepatriation of the refugees to their home country  but isengaged in reckless and deplorable acts to drive a wedgebetween the refugees and the people of the Sudan  whohave offered commendable hospitality during the long yearsof war. And when this policy did not work  the NIF regimebegan subjecting the refugees to arbitrary imprisonment torture  and banishment after confiscation of their propertyby its security authorities. Moreover  young refugees wereforcibly conscripted and given military training to bedeployed in subversive activities across the border.Organized repatriation of these refugees  the pilot phase ofwhich has been successfully achieved  is impeded by thelame excuses the NIF fabricates. All these pressures havecaused the refugees to return home spontaneously at highrisk.All these acts of hostility perpetrated by the NIFregime to implement its designs of destabilizingneighbours should surely be of grave concern to thisAssembly and the international community at large  giventheir wider regional security ramifications.Allow me further to recall the incident that eruptedbetween Eritrea and the Republic of Yemen in December1995  following the latter’s occupation of the Eritreanarchipelago of Hanish-Zuqar  at the southern entrance tothe Red Sea. Perhaps due to its sensitivity  the incidentaroused immediate international concern and mediationendeavours.The Government of Eritrea  which all along hadsought international arbitration to the dispute  promptlyaccepted  with full appreciation  the mediation initiativesof the Ethiopian and Egyptian Governments  and later thatof the United Nations Secretary-General  which greatlyhelped to defuse tensions and paved the way for thepeaceful handling of the dispute. When facilitation by theFrench Government was proposed  the EritreanGovernment accepted it wholeheartedly.These decisions were taken by the EritreanGovernment against a background of mendaciousaccusations and irresponsible campaigns by the Yemeniauthorities to escalate the situation. The incident was alsofanned by those in certain quarters who sought to servetheir vested interests in the troubled waters. However genuine desires and a sincere political will prevailed.Ultimately  restraint and careful handling of theissue  in addition to positive and constructive regional andinternational intervention  culminated in the Agreement onPrinciples  signed by both parties on 21 May 1996 inParis.In this Agreement  both the State of Eritrea and theRepublic of Yemen unequivocally expressed their desireto settle their dispute over the Hanish-Zuqar archipelagoby the verdict of a court of arbitration. Developmentssince the signing of the document could be consideredgenerally positive and encouraging. However  allegationswere made by the Republic of Yemen that Eritrean forcesoccupied the island of Lesser Hanish on 10 August 1996 and the matter was hastily referred to the SecurityCouncil. The fact of the matter was that units of theEritrean forces were on that island both before and afterthe signing of the Agreement on Principles on 21 May1996. Despite this truth  the Eritrean Governmentwithdrew its forces as a gesture of goodwill and in the2interest of the smooth progress of the arbitration processand to preserve and promote the peace of the region.The Eritrean Government has time and again affirmedits adherence to the Agreement on Principles of 21 May1996  and expressed its commitment to abide by thedecisions of the court of arbitration. I am pleased tounderline that the subsidiary agreement reached between thetwo sides in Paris last week  on 3 October  will now allowfor the proceedings of the court of arbitration to start earlynext year.The agonizing and intractable reality in Somaliacannot but impel the international community to search forways and means of expediting an end to this long  drawn-out tragedy. The complexity of the situation is too apparentto require more elaboration here. But it is clear that noamount of well-meaning external support will succeed inrestoring normalcy to Somalia unless the Somalisthemselves take stock of the senseless bloodshed that hastorn the country apart and produce what it takes to forgepeace and national reconciliation. Admittedly  the countriesof the region could have played a more catalytic part in thismulti-pronged effort. The lack of a consistent andcoordinated regional and international initiative  however may entail more preoccupying negative developments.Indeed  there are indications these days of a growinginvolvement of various external actors that seem bent onexploiting the vacuum to promote their hidden agendas.Somalia is in fact drifting towards becoming fertile groundfor extremist groups. For the sake of the Somalis  and inthe interest of regional peace and stability  it is vital thatthese trends be checked before it is too late and that theregional initiative be resuscitated.The recent developments in the Middle East whichappear to have cast some shadows on the Oslo agreementare naturally a matter of preoccupation to all those whowish to see an enduring settlement to the conflict betweenthe Israelis and the Palestinians. Whatever the shortcomingsof the agreement  there can be no alternative to the peaceprocess. My Government therefore appeals to both sides topersevere in the process of dialogue and negotiations so thata lasting peace that ensures the well-being of all the peoplesof the region will be assured.In conclusion  we share the views of many MemberStates on the imperative of restructuring the decision-making bodies of the United Nations  particularly theSecurity Council. The Security Council continues to play avitally important role in the maintenance of internationalpeace and security. It is my delegation’s belief that nowis the opportune moment to revitalize it  make it moredemocratic and improve its value  effectiveness andlegitimacy so as to make it reflect the universal characterof the Organization. Powerful and convincing argumentshave been made by many speakers to the effect that  atpresent  the Security Council is neither equitable norrepresentative. The circumstances of international politicshave altered so fundamentally that there are compellingreasons for change.In spite of the broadly shared wish for reform discussions so far have not really come close to thegeneral agreement needed. It is our firm belief thatflexibility and compromise will be necessary. There area number of interesting elements in the proposals  towhich thorough attention should be given so that we cantry to bring about the necessary change."
"52",2214,"ESP",51,1996,"﻿Iwould like first of all to express to Ambassador Razali mycordial congratulations on his election as President of theGeneral Assembly. I am firmly convinced that his qualitieswill enable us to solve successfully the central questions ofparticular relevance included in our agenda. Permit me aswell in these opening comments to extend my fraternalgratitude to Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral of Portugal forhis rigorous and able leadership during the fiftieth sessionof the General Assembly. I would also like to express myrespect to the Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  whose efforts at the head of the Secretariat in thisparticularly difficult moment Spain considers very positiveand worthy of our support.The Spanish delegation fully subscribes to thestatement made a few days ago by the Deputy PrimeMinister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ireland onbehalf of the European Union  in which he set out thecommon goals and priorities of Europe for the presentsession of the General Assembly.I would now like to refer in detail to various issuesof particular interest to my country. First of all  however I wish to reaffirm the strong commitment of Spain and itsnew Government to the purposes and principles of theCharter of the United Nations. On 26 June 1945 at SanFrancisco  at a time when mankind still had not recoveredfrom the horrors of the Second World War  therepresentatives of the peoples of the United Nationsexpressed their firm resolve to save succeedinggenerations from the scourge of war. They also reaffirmedtheir faith in fundamental human rights; in the dignity andworth of the human person; and in the equal rights ofmen and nations  both large and small.Fifty-one years later  when the necessary conditionsfor a new international order based on cooperation andsolidarity among nations have finally been met  thecommitments made in San Francisco take on renewedstanding. The United Nations  in fact  constitutes atpresent the best instrument at mankind’s disposal to faceand solve — jointly  on the basis of dialogue andsolidarity among Member States — the global challengesconfronting mankind at the end of the millennium.We must make sure that our political commitment tothe Organization is manifested in actions  not only bymaking available the necessary financial resources  butalso through the active search for consensus solutions forthe reform of the United Nations within the variousworking groups of the General Assembly. OurOrganization  which was designed to respond to bothglobal challenges and to the needs of its Member States will not be able to play its double role in the comingcentury unless it can count on a sound  solid and stablefinancial basis. Convinced of this need  Spain  the ninth-largest contributor to the budget of the Organization  payspromptly and in full its assessed contributions.When we celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of theUnited Nations with the renewed commitment of all theMember States to the principles of the Charter  we allconcurred on the need to adapt the Organization to thenew international situation by enhancing its efficiencythrough an in-depth reform which will revitalize andstrengthen it. Obviously  carrying out this task means the9continuation and the deepening of the necessaryrationalization and savings measures already undertaken bythe Secretariat. In this respect  the approval at the lastsession of the General Assembly of the programme budgetfor the biennium 1996-1997  has given Spain satisfaction.We are aware today more than ever before  of theinterrelated nature of the problems confronting theinternational community and of impossibility for MemberStates of solving them individually. This is why there is nodoubt that it is within the framework of the United Nationswhere we must bring together efforts in order to face insolidarity the many crises which menace the world.The international community certainly cannot remainimpassive before the magnitude of problems such as theones faced by the African continent. This year we havewitnessed terrifying massacres — such as those inLiberia — and the displacement of people in the GreatLakes region  particularly in Burundi where we continue towitness a terrible and tragic spectacle.Africa is not  however  a continent entirely andinevitably abandoned to hopelessness. There are countriesin which the tenacious efforts of their leaders and thecourage of their peoples allow them to embrace hope. Thereturn to the rule of law  the establishment of soliddemocracies and respect for human rights are the way toestablish the foundations of a sustained and sustainabledevelopment which will ensure the welfare of all Africans.The Government of Spain has followed with greatattention the developments in the Middle East — focusedin the peace process between Arabs and Israelis — inwhich the question of Palestine continues to be the centralpoint. We are following with great concern the seriousevents that have taken place in recent days in Jerusalem the West Bank and Gaza  and we wish to reiterate our callto the parties involved to abstain from all acts ofprovocation and violence that could lead to a newescalation of tension which could jeopardize the peaceprocess.Furthermore  the Israeli elections held in May and theestablishment of the new Government became the basicpoints of reference for the assessment of this complex issueand for the analysis of its future prospects. After a briefperiod of uncertainty  the Israeli Government has clearlystated its intention to honour fully the contents of theagreements concluded in Oslo and Washington in the spiritof the principles of Madrid.Such a positive statement of intentions would haveto be followed immediately by concrete and tangibleprogress  which would strengthen the credibility of thepeace process as the only valid alternative to attainpeaceful coexistence in the region.There are still many problems to be solved. On theone hand  it is of course necessary to preserve andstrengthen the safety of civilians from the blind andruthless violence of terrorism; on the other  the closure ofthe Palestinian territories  the delay in redeployment ofthe Israeli Army in Hebron and the policy of settlementsrepresent serious obstacles for progress in the peaceprocess.On the basis of the Florence Declaration issued bythe European Union  I avail myself of this opportunityfirmly to reiterate the commitment of Spain to the MiddleEast peace process as the only way to solve this question.In this respect  my Government will continue to workactively  at the national level and within the EuropeanUnion  to promote the cause of peace and understandingamong the peoples of the region.On a broader level  I wish to express my satisfactionat the initial achievements of the Euro-Mediterraneandialogue. The Spanish Government’s priority objective isto contribute to the balanced and harmonious developmentof the three dimensions of this process: political economic and human. To this end  it will be necessary tomaintain and enhance the “spirit of Barcelona” shown byall countries participating in the Ministerial Conferencethat my country had the honour of hosting last November.In connection with the question of Western Sahara I must express the concern of the Spanish Government atthe suspension of the voter-identification operation andthe blocking of the settlement plan. In this respect  I wishto recall before this Assembly Spain’s principled position according to which the question of Western Sahara willbe solved permanently only through the exercise of theright of self-determination by the people of WesternSahara in a free referendum with international guarantees.The recent elections in Bosnia and Herzegovina haveended a cycle in the process of implementation of theDayton Agreement that was marked by an inevitablepredominance of military over civilian aspects. Peace hasbecome a reality in Bosnia and Herzegovina and theabsence of confrontation is tangible evidence of thesuccess of the multinational military operation. However along with this success has been an absence of the10necessary reconciliation between the parties and therestoration of mutual confidence.Since the onset of the conflict  Spain has contributedto its solution with a substantial military presence in theUnited Nations Protection Force  subsequently renewed inthe multinational  Implementation Force. My Governmentintends to continue supporting stability and reconciliation inthe region as well as the United Nations efforts along thoselines.The consolidation of democratic Governments growing respect for human rights and economic and socialprogress are a tangible reality in and a stimulus for thefuture of Latin America  a continent to which Spain islinked by solid historical ties of mutual friendship andconfidence. We are particularly gratified by the positivedevelopments in Central America  where the consolidatedadvances of democracy and the increasing stability of peacedemonstrate that efforts to promote the rule of law  goodgovernance and respect for human rights are finally havingtangible effects on the lives of the people.I wish to underline  from this rostrum  Spain’scommitment to peacekeeping operations. My Governmentfirmly intends to continue contributing to these operations.I wish to pay my warmest and most sincere tribute to themen and women involved in all these operations for theiraltruistic and selfless work in conditions of extremedifficulty and high risk  which sometimes has meantsacrificing their lives in the interest of peace.The United Nations peacekeeping operations havebecome a cornerstone of the activity of our Organization.I wish to highlight here the important momentum given bythe Secretary-General in his “An Agenda for Peace” to thedevelopment and deepening of new concepts of preventivediplomacy  peacemaking and peacekeeping.The role of the United Nations in the decolonizationprocess  particularly in the definition of its generalprinciples  to which Spain adheres unequivocally  has beenfundamental. The current membership of this GeneralAssembly clearly demonstrates that the process has beenone of the great achievements of our time.In fact  the main phase of decolonization ended sometime ago. However  anachronistic colonial situations persistthat ought not to be forgotten. One of the priority objectivesof the Spanish Government is the decolonization ofGibraltar. Through its resolutions  this General Assemblypointed the way to a decolonization process which  basedon the principle of territorial integrity  should be carriedout through bilateral negotiations between the UnitedKingdom  the Colony’s administrative Power and Spain the State in whose territory the Colony is located. TheSpanish Government will carry out with the greatestflexibility  but also the greatest firmness  the futurebilateral negotiations with the United Kingdom on thebasis of the Brussels Declaration of November 1984  withthe clear aim of moving forward in the process toculminate in the restoration of Spain’s full territorialintegrity  generously safeguarding the interests of theColony’s population and convinced of the urgent need tobring an end to the anachronism of the existence of acolony of one European Union member State in theterritory of another friendly and allied member State.Spain is pleased to have fulfilled its aspiration ofbecoming a full member of the Conference onDisarmament. In this capacity  we will continue tosupport the enlargement of the Conference to includeother candidates still hoping to join.We are pleased that the General Assembly adoptedby an overwhelming majority the ComprehensiveNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT)  which I have had thehonour to sign on behalf of my country. Spain willparticipate in the network of seismological centres set upfor the international verification of compliance with theTreaty and will support the early start-up of the Treatyorganization.Universal adherence to the Treaty on theNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons continues to be apriority objective  along with the other initiatives in thefield of nuclear disarmament.Spain  one of the first signatories to ratify theConvention on the Prohibition of the Development Production  Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weaponsand on Their Destruction  is also pleased that the figureof 65 ratifications necessary for its entry into force isabout to be reached. We trust that all the signatory Statesthat have yet to do so will deposit their instruments ofratification as soon as possible.My country is carrying out the necessary proceduresto ratify the new Protocol IV on blinding laser weaponsand we are making every effort to put an end to the tragiceffects of anti-personnel mines.I referred at the beginning of my statement to theneed  which I know is shared  to proceed with the reform revitalization and strengthening of the United Nations. Wemust make our Organization the centre for harmonizingefforts to promote respect for international law  world peaceand equality for all  streamlining the mechanisms of theCharter and removing the political and logistical obstaclesthat all too often hinder its work.As part of the institutional reform  the process ofexpanding and reforming the Security Council stands out.It is well known that Spain supports a moderate increase inthe membership of the Council as the result of a considerednegotiating process and with the final aim of enhancing thelegitimacy of its actions.On the other hand  “An Agenda for Development”must be a key element in this reform process and theculmination of the series of major conferences focusing onthe integral development of the individual that have beenheld in recent years.In the general context of this common task ofreforming the United Nations  I should like in particular torefer to the new measures  adopted by this Assembly inresolution 50/227  on restructuring and revitalization in theeconomic  social and other fields. These measures reaffirmthe unequivocal will of all countries significantly toimprove the work of the Economic and Social Council asthe central mechanism for coordinating and supervisingUnited Nations activities in the economic and social fields.As an example of Spain’s commitment to thedevelopment activities of the Organization  I should like torecall that  in the past year  my country has concluded ahost of bilateral agreements with various bodies of theUnited Nations system for the funding of specific projectsfor developing countries.The Rio Summit was a milestone in the history of thefight against environmental deterioration and established thebasis for a concept of sustainable development that does notcompromise the welfare of future generations. However  thehealth of our planet is far from being as good as it ought tobe. We must take advantage of the forthcoming specialsession of this Assembly to give new impetus to the jointefforts being made to protect the environment  the truecommon heritage of humankind.The Vienna Declaration and Programme of Actionadopted at the World Conference on Human Rights definedthe promotion and protection of human rights as a priorityobjective of the international community. Spain fullysubscribes to this principle. The promotion and protectionof human rights are in themselves ineluctable necessities and the survival of many  many human beings depends ontheir effective implementation. Sustainable developmentfor all is not feasible without institutions that help in therealization of human rights.In this regard  the High Commissioner for HumanRights should have more resources at hand to continue hislaudable work on restructuring the Centre for HumanRights. On the other hand  defending human rights isparticularly important where the weakest people  thosemost needing protection and self-defence  are involved. Inthis context  Spain believes that we should capitalize onthe stimulus of the World Congress on the CommercialSexual Exploitation of Children held recently inStockholm  to promote through this Organization the mostrigorous and comprehensive protection of minors.In the final phase of the League of Nations  anattempt was made  unfortunately without success  toimplement the trilogy of arbitration-security-disarmament.The Government of Spain is convinced that theprohibition of the use and threat of use of force must beaccompanied by a general provision in international lawmaking recourse to jurisdictional channels mandatory forthe settlement of disputes. It was for this reason that  ina unilateral declaration of 15 October 1990  ourGovernment  the Government of Spain  recognized ascompulsory  ipso facto and without special agreement  thejurisdiction of the International Court of Justice  asprovided for in the Statute of the Court.It is true that the United Nations cannot solve all theproblems of humankind. But our Organization can lookback with the certainty that its role  in the past and in thepresent  has not been and is not insignificant and that  formany regions of our planet  the present and the futurewould be different  harsher and more forlorn without theUnited Nations.For this reason  I could not conclude withoutreiterating the firmest and most rigorous commitment ofSpain to the United Nations."
"53",2240,"EST",51,1996,"﻿Let me begin by congratulatingMr. Razali Ismail on his assumption of the office ofPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-first session.I am confident that his valuable guidance will lead to thesuccessful outcome of this session. He has the assurance ofour full support.As an introduction  let me recall that this Septembermarks the fifth anniversary of Estonia’s return to theinternational scene. It was five years ago that the Estonianblue  black and white tricolour was hoisted in front of thisforum. That moment was equal in historic and emotionalsignificance to the one 70 years earlier  in September 1921in Geneva  when Estonia was welcomed as a new memberof the League of Nations — an international organizationwhose history has taught the world many lessons.The cold war is over. Nevertheless  the internationalcommunity continues to seek further guarantees of a moresecure future for our children and grandchildren. In thisrespect  Estonia would like to express satisfaction at therecent overwhelming support for the ComprehensiveNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty adopted by the General Assembly.The signing ceremony at the United Nations on 24September was an important milestone  a result ofcontinued negotiations and at the same time a sign of hopefor the future. We firmly believe that the Treaty can makean important contribution to preventing the proliferation ofnuclear weapons and promoting international security. TheUnited Nations must now give a clear response to peoplewho want to live in a world free of any threats of nuclearweapons and other means of mass destruction.Our world is facing new challenges. These newchallenges require a renewed United Nations. At the lastsession  considerable efforts were made to reform theOrganization. This work will continue during the currentsession. In fact  one of the principal goals of the sessionahead of us will be to increase the effectiveness of theUnited Nations. Estonia welcomes the progress made in thisarea. There are still a number of ways by which the UnitedNations can further improve its performance. We attachparticular importance to the review of the working methodsof the functional commissions and expert groups and bodiesof the Economic and Social Council  as well as to bettercoordination between the work of the Second and ThirdCommittees.Estonia is looking forward to active participation inUnited Nations-reform working groups. We attachspecific importance to the financial reform of theOrganization. Estonia is supportive of the view that theUnited Nations should be put on a sounder financialfooting. Member States should make every effort to fulfiltheir obligation to pay their arrears without anyconditions. At the same time  we share the understandingthat the United Nations scale of assessments should berevised. The new scale of assessments must be fair andmore transparent. It should also better reflect thefundamental principle of capacity to pay. We hope thatthe High-level Open-ended Working Group on theFinancial Situation of the United Nations will achieve acomprehensive and consensus solution to the currentfinancial difficulties of the Organization.The reform of the Organization will also includechanges in the composition and working methods of theSecurity Council. We welcome the decision by theGeneral Assembly mandating the relevant Open-endedWorking Group to submit a report to the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-first session. At the same time  wehope that  along the lines of the mandate of the WorkingGroup  Member States can bring about a resolution to thelong-standing discussions on Security Councilenlargement.Peacekeeping continues to be one of the importantactivities of the Organization. Recent years have seen achanging role for United Nations peacekeeping missions.Today they have grown into manifold and diversifiedtypes of action. A new challenge for United Nationspeacekeepers is dealing with internal conflicts throughoutthe world. In this respect  I would like to reiterate thatregional peacekeeping efforts that are conducted under theauspices of the United Nations must remain understringent United Nations control.Estonia is continuing to take part in United Nationspeacekeeping. This autumn we will increase ourcontribution to the United Nations peacekeeping forces byoffering a company to the United Nations Interim Forcein Lebanon (UNIFIL). The company will be deployed inthe Norwegian battalion. The deployment is part of a jointproject to develop a Baltic peacekeeping battalion. Thatbattalion will be the contribution of the Baltic States tothe strengthening of United Nations peacekeepingcapacities. I would like to take this opportunity to thankall of the Governments that have contributed to thiscommon Baltic project.23During the past year Estonia has taken further stepstowards the implementation and follow-up of the majorUnited Nations Conferences — Rio  Vienna  Cairo Copenhagen  Beijing and Istanbul. To this end  a specialinter-ministerial commission has been established inEstonia. Since the critical areas of concern of many of theconferences overlap  we are also looking forward to a bettercoordination of their outcomes.Last year important work was done by the PreparatoryCommittee on the Establishment of an InternationalCriminal Court in elaborating the text of a statute for sucha court. We welcome that work and look forward to furtherprogress during the fifty-first session.Failure to respect human rights and fundamentalfreedoms is a major cause of conflict. Many intra-Stateconflicts arise from the denial of basic human rights. TheVienna World Conference on Human Rights made it clearthat the promotion and protection of all human rights is aduty for all States. Estonia reaffirms its continuedcommitment to human rights. In spite of the hardships ofinstitutional and economic transition  we have been able tomake democracy a way of life. Human rights for allresidents of Estonia is an inextricable part of Estoniandemocracy.We continue to place particular importance upon thework of the High Commissioner for Human Rights  Mr.José Ayala Lasso  the Centre for Human Rights and UnitedNations human rights machinery in general. A transparentfunctioning of this machinery should rely on impartialreporting and disregard politically motivated allegations.Failure to do so would seriously damage the credibility ofthe Organization. Owing to very recent memories  thisissue is of special importance to Estonia. This is also oneof the reasons why Estonia lists among its priorities issuesregarding indigenous peoples and human rights.Estonia believes that it is essential to secureadequate financing for the office of the United NationsHigh Commissioner for Human Rights and the Centre forHuman Rights. At the same time  we would like to pointout that various regional organizations that focus onhuman rights issue periodic reports regarding suchmatters. In order to avoid duplication and to makeeffective use of resources  the United Nations humanrights machinery should rely on the extensive expertise ofregional organizations  including the Organization forSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and theCouncil of Europe. Those two organizations foster thebasic foundations of security and stability in Europe. TheUnited Nations should further enhance its ties with them especially with the Council of Europe  the establishedstronghold of human rights on the European continent anda symbol of cooperation between nations striving for anopen and mutually beneficial dialogue. Estonia  thecurrent Chairman of the Council of Europe  is pursuingpolicies of positive engagement in relations with allcountries  including our eastern neighbour. In this respect it is our sincere hope that the Russian Federation willreciprocate our efforts.In conclusion  let me underline our commitment tocontribute  together with all Member States  to theestablishment of a world community in which individualsand States may live in peace and understanding. Let meexpress our sincere hope for a better world."
"54",2286,"ETH",51,1996,"﻿First of all  I should like tocongratulate you  Sir  on your election as President of thefifty-first session of the General Assembly. I wish toassure you the full cooperation of my delegation in thedischarge of this heavy responsibility entrusted to you. I10should like also to take this opportunity to pay tribute toyour predecessor  Mr. Freitas do Amaral  for the ablemanner in which he fulfilled his responsibilities.Last year we celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of theUnited Nations and reiterated our dedication to the purposesand principles of the Organization  for the promotion ofwhich it was established. That occasion also afforded us theopportunity to take stock of United Nations achievementsand of its yet-unfinished business  as well as of thecontinuing challenges faced by both the Organization andthe international community at large.That stock-taking exercise could not have led us tounderestimate  let alone belittle  what has been achieved bythe United Nations. In any case  in so far as the UnitedNations is our universal Organization  its failings can onlybe our failings  as its successes are also ours. None the less last year’s stock-taking of the performance of the 50-year-old United Nations must have underlined more thananything else how complex and daunting the challengesfaced by the Organization and by the internationalcommunity are becoming. There are probably no greaterchallenges before the international community in this regardthan those of development and of peace and stability —two concerns that define the very essence of the UnitedNations and that constitute the core purposes and objectivesof the Organization.It is not yet a distant memory that we all rejoiced atthe end of the cold war  believing that it would open upnew vistas of opportunity for addressing the vital issues ofinternational concern that had been overshadowed fordecades by the arms race  East-West rivalry and othermanifestations of the cold-war era. That positivedevelopment — the end of the cold war — also encouragedmany in the developing world  especially those of us inAfrica  to undertake far-reaching political and economicreform measures  with a view to laying the foundation fordemocratic transformation and meaningful economic growthand development.Despite all these manifested hopes and courageousmoves towards economic reform and democracy  thesituation on the African continent remains a source of greatconcern. At present  Africa is the only continent where thelevel of poverty is increasing dramatically. Needless to say this trend could lead to unimaginable consequences unlessit is arrested and reversed as speedily as possible.Thus  Africa’s genuine fear is that the opportunity createdby the end of the cold war will disappear and that ahistoric chance will be squandered forever.It is by no means accidental that  of all the regionsof the world  Africa is the most affected by conflicts andlack of stability. Conflicts in our continent have not onlybeen greater in number  but have also proved to be moreintractable and  more often than not  more deadly andmore destructive  in terms of both human lives andproperty.It may not always be plausible to suggest that allconflicts in Africa have their roots in economicdifficulties only. But  whatever the constellation of factorsimmediately responsible for specific conflict situations inAfrica  the fact remains that in most instances civil strifeand conflicts in the continent have emerged within thecontext of deteriorating economic situations. In thiscontext  the only durable solution for the political crisisin Africa can be found in the economic regeneration anddevelopment of the continent. Development is thereforethe only reliable preventive means to ensure and maintainpeace and stability in Africa.The development of Africa will continue to be adistant dream unless the known obstacles are removed among which the debt burden continues to be the majorimpediment. In this context  we are encouraged by therecent Lyon summit of the Group of Seven  which wewere hopeful would go beyond the Naples terms in easingthe debt overhang for countries such as Ethiopia. We alsohope that some progress will be made during theupcoming annual meeting of the World Bank and theInternational Monetary Fund in connection withmultilateral debt. For countries like my own  this is verycrucial indeed.While durable solutions to conflicts and to the lackof peace and stability in Africa or anywhere else canhardly be achieved within the context of economicdislocation and economic decline  it is also equally truethat development requires peace and stability. This is thevicious circle we find ourselves in  which makes itdifficult to find speedy resolution of the very manyconflict situations that have led to unspeakable humansuffering  and on some occasions to genocide  in Africa.In Somalia  where peace and national reconciliationhave eluded the people for close to six years  we are stillfar from making any headway in reversing the situation.Efforts are  however  still continuing to help bring aboutnational reconciliation in Somalia  and my own PrimeMinister has continued to attach the highest importance tothis endeavour. In all these efforts  the role of theOrganization of African Unity (OAU) has been vital;whether it is in Liberia  Burundi  Somalia or other conflictsituations in Africa  the important contribution that theOAU Secretary-General has been making is a source ofgreat satisfaction to us. The Organization of African Unityhas indeed upgraded its capacity for conflict resolution inour continent since the establishment in 1993 of the OAUMechanism for Conflict Prevention  Management andResolution. I wish to seize this opportunity to expressappreciation to all those who have continued to help ensurethat the OAU’s role in this area is strengthened andenhanced.Conflict situations  whether in Africa or elsewhere have negative consequences not only for the countriesdirectly affected but also for their neighbours and theirregions. The situation in Somalia has not been an exceptionto this. The absence of central authority for an extendedperiod of time in that country has been seen to provideopportunity for extra-regional elements bent on exportingterror and on experimenting with plans designed to createinstability and chaos in our region. It is therefore in mycountry’s direct national interest that peace be establishedand national reconciliation achieved in Somalia as speedilyas possible.This is also in the interest of our region in general.Our region  which has had a prolonged period of instabilityand which has also recently experienced State-sponsoredterrorism  cannot afford and should not be expected totolerate the proliferation and the establishment of centres ofinternational terrorism by multinational elements in ourmidst. The spread of terrorism is not a danger merely toour region  but to the international community as a whole.Ethiopia’s conscience is clear in this regard because it hasdone its level best to fulfil its responsibilities in the fightagainst terrorism  and it will always remain committed tocombating this evil.At present  the most worrying conflict  with thepotential for a level of human slaughter which we all dreadto see  is the one in Burundi. The parties to the conflict inBurundi have the responsibility to save their society fromdecimation through accommodation based on principles thatsuit the specific conditions of their country. Others with amuch more complex societal mix have managed to put inplace democratic mechanisms to reconcile the right of themajority to govern with sufficient guarantees for thesecurity and dignity of the minority. This is whatex-President Mwalimu Nyerere has been striving to assistthe Burundi parties to achieve through the Mwanza peaceprocess  a process which enjoys the full support of theUnited Nations and of the international community. I wishto take this opportunity to express appreciation for theresolve and unity that the countries of the region havedemonstrated in an effort to see to it that disaster isaverted in Burundi and that the country achieves nationalreconciliation. I wish also to express appreciation to allthose who have continued to support the Mwanza processand the initiative that was taken by the countries of theregion on 31 July 1996.My country  which emerged from a very difficultperiod of conflicts and severe economic hardships onlyfive years ago  has made major strides on all frontsduring this brief period of time. We draw immensesatisfaction from the fact that our people have finallyachieved durable peace and stability. Moreover  oureconomic reform programmes have started to bear fruit;we are encouraged by the results achieved  particularly inagricultural production  over the past few years. ThatEthiopia now has the capacity not only to feed itself  butalso to be an exporter of food grains  is increasinglybecoming a reality.Ethiopia is striving to enhance its capacity tobecome a useful and effective partner in internationaleconomic cooperation. We intend to make our country anattractive place for investment; all the necessaryfoundations have already been laid by my Government tothis end. We are determined to make trade and investmentthe major pillars of our economic cooperation with others.Ethiopia has also endeavoured to contribute its shareto regional and international peace and stability over thepast few years. That is a policy that we intend to expandfurther with a view to fulfilling our regional andinternational commitments  no matter how small ourcontribution might be.Ethiopia welcomes the recent adoption of theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty by the fiftiethsession of the General Assembly. We believe that itrepresents an important step towards the attainment of thelarger objectives of nuclear non-proliferation and nucleardisarmament.As a founding Member of the United Nations Ethiopia attaches the highest importance to the work ofthe United Nations and wishes to see the Organizationrevitalized and strengthened. In this context  Ethiopia  like12many other countries  is convinced that the future of theUnited Nations lies in its democratization and in thecreation of conditions under which all Member States  bigor small  will feel that the Organization belongs equally toall of them.With respect to developments in Africa  in the area ofconflict prevention and in other areas  my Government iskeen to see more effective cooperation between the UnitedNations and the Organization of African Unity. No doubt much work needs to be done in this area  and we areconfident that the mechanism for consultation already inplace between the two organizations will be utilized moreeffectively and with a far greater sense of purpose andconsistency.I wish to take this opportunity to express myGovernment’s appreciation to the Secretary-General for hisvery useful and timely initiative on the United NationsSystem-wide Special Initiative on Africa. The SpecialInitiative is complementary to the United Nations NewAgenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s  and through the reallocation of existing resources and themobilization of additional ones  will contribute to thedevelopment of Africa. We hope that the Special Initiativewill be implemented as planned and that it will not  likeprevious initiatives  remain unfulfilled and be anothersource of frustration and an empty promise.We believe that the United Nations can do more topromote effectively the purposes and principles enshrinedin its Charter and to galvanize international cooperation toachieve peace and development. Our world cannot afford tosee the international community divided in two  with onehalf remaining poor and becoming even poorer. Theimperatives of interdependence dictate that this trend bereversed  especially when all that those who are laggingbehind demand is the removal of the obstacles todevelopment and an opportunity to address their economicproblems on the basis of their own efforts.Ethiopia is confident that the United Nations will playan increasingly dynamic role  so that all the nations andpeoples of the world will have an equal stake in thepreservation of global civilization and in enriching humansociety."
"55",2332,"FIN",51,1996,"﻿Let me offer AmbassadorRazali my sincerest congratulation on his election asPresident of the General Assembly. This session willaddress many difficult and important questions. I amconfident that under his experienced and wise leadershipwe shall achieve good and constructive results. I shouldalso like to express the thanks and appreciation of myGovernment to the Secretary-General and to the manydedicated women and men in the Secretariat.Let me refer to the statement made by the DeputyPrime Minister of Ireland on behalf of the EuropeanUnion. My Government fully endorses that statement.As the United Nations enters its fifty-first year  oneconclusion is self-evident: questions of peace development and human rights can no longer be neatlyseparated. They interact  and nowhere more so than at theUnited Nations.Let me begin with human rights. There can be nosustainable peace in societies where the human rights ofindividuals are not respected or where their democraticaspirations are denied. Widespread violations of humanrights  including the rights of minorities  breed instabilityand conflict. The United Nations is then  often too late called upon to deal with them. There can be nosustainable development in societies where economic andsocial rights  as well as political rights  are flouted.Authoritarian rule is no answer to poverty orenvironmental degradation. The universality of humanrights cannot be questioned. True  civilizations differ;societies differ. But that does not mean that cultural religious  ideological or any other factors can be invokedas legitimate justifications for human rights violations. Todo so is to deny the inherent equality of human beings.But adherence to general principles is not enough.The litmus test is  of course  practice. Here at the UnitedNations we must ask ourselves what we can do togetherto promote respect for human rights. I see at least threeareas where the General Assembly can and should act.First  we must see to it that the United Nationsmechanisms that have been created to promote andmonitor respect for human rights are not impaired throughlack of funds. The High Commissioner for Human Rights his special rapporteurs and the human rights treaty bodieswithin the United Nations system are entitled to oursupport. The General Assembly should insist on thenecessary funding.Secondly  we must help establish  in accordance withthe conclusions of the Preparatory Committee  apermanent international criminal court to deal withflagrant violations of international humanitarian law and3human rights. I do not have to belabour the reasons why.One look at Rwanda or the former Yugoslavia is enough.Thirdly  we must ensure sustained and integratedfollow-up of the United Nations conferences from Viennato Istanbul  so as to implement fully the agreed programmesof action. Nationally  Governments must commit theresources necessary to make the agreed actions a reality. Inthe case of the Vienna and Beijing Conferences inparticular  full and equal enjoyment of human rights by allwomen everywhere must be the first goal towards whichthe United Nations and all Governments must aspire.In Finland  women gained full political rights — theright to vote and  just as important  the right to be eligiblefor Parliament — as early as 1906; that is  90 years ago.Finland thus became the very first country in the worldwhere this was made possible. We have come a long waysince then  but we still need to do better until  finally women are just as equally empowered in Finnish society asmen. I know that the same is true to varying degrees inother countries too.Children  whether girls or boys  are full-fledgedsubjects of human rights. Almost universal ratification ofthe United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Childhas been achieved. States Parties must now ensure universalimplementation too. The message from the recentStockholm World Congress against Commercial SexualExploitation of Children was clear: full implementation ofchildren’s rights is also the best guarantee against sexualexploitation. The United Nations must now  along withGovernments  follow up the commitments of Stockholm and with vigour.Even the most democratic societies are vulnerable toconflicts  even to armed ones. We should therefore do ourutmost to prevent them and  to this end  make full use ofall means available to the international community.Finland believes in United Nations peacekeeping. Wehave participated for 40 years and stand ready to continue.The sheer complexity of modern-day conflicts has turnedUnited Nations thinking towards comprehensive peaceoperations. Peacekeeping must be seen as a part of acomprehensive peace process. We welcome this approach.The civilian and military elements of a peace operationshould operate in close cooperation. Artificial barriersseparating the two should be eliminated right at the outsetin devising the mandate for an operation. It is alsoimportant that peace operations be linked with longer-termpeace-building efforts to promote stability and sustainablehuman development.Lessons have been learned the hard way in the pastfew years. United Nations peacekeepers are not suited forpeace enforcement. That job should and can be entrustedby the Security Council to others — whether regionalorganizations or other outside ad hoc coalitions — ifnecessary. But these are exceptional cases. For the vastmajority of conflicts  the United Nations will be the onecalled upon for peacekeeping. Even if the United Nationsmust be able to say no on occasions  the worldOrganization cannot shirk its responsibility. Moreover when the United Nations acts  it should act on time andwith the support of its members  including funding.Time is of the essence in responding to crises.Further development of the existing standby arrangementswith Member States is the most practical way to enhancethe rapid-reaction capability of the Organization.Therefore  Finland strongly supports the establishment ofa rapidly deployable headquarters unit at the UnitedNations as soon as possible.Prevention  naturally  is better than cure. Inpeacekeeping as well  preventive deployment is aninnovation that is working right now in The formerYugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Finland is convincedthat the United Nations Preventive Deployment Force(UNPREDEP) operation is making a crucial contributionto stability in the whole region. It is a full-fledgedoperation in preventive diplomacy encompassing goodoffices  monitoring and human and institutionaldevelopment  as well as troop deployment. Thatcontribution  based on the present mandate  shouldcontinue until peace and stability in the whole region arebetter assured.This is the year of the nuclear-test ban. That is whatthe General Assembly demanded a year ago  and that iswhat the vast majority of the world’s nations has nowagreed. I was proud to sign the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty for my country. That Treaty willstrengthen the security of all of us  without exception.Banning nuclear-test explosions is a goal to which theinternational community has been committed for decades.The Treaty accomplishes that goal. At the same time  theTreaty is a step towards the ultimate elimination ofnuclear weapons.4However  focusing on nuclear weapons is not enough.We also need to focus on weapons that maim and killpeople today. Those weapons are conventional weapons particularly landmines  other small arms and light weapons.The excessive accumulation and proliferation of smallarms threaten to destabilize communities  countries andentire regions. A United Nations expert panel  on which mycountry is represented  is looking into the problem rightnow. Finland  for one  expects concrete recommendationson how to deal with this clear and present dangernationally  regionally and through the United Nations.The indiscriminate use of anti-personnel landmines isthe most visible manifestation of the small-arms emergency.When they finally achieve peace  societies already ravagedby years of war are severely hampered in theirreconstruction efforts by landmines that have beenindiscriminately sown by the millions. A concertedinternational effort  led by the United Nations  is needed toassist in mine clearance. Demining should also be made anintegral part of peacekeeping mandates  as was recentlysuggested by Germany and endorsed by the SecurityCouncil.It is increasingly clear  however  that in the end onlya prohibition of inhumane and indiscriminate landmine usecan bring a real solution. To be effective  such a solutionmust be legally binding  global and verifiable. As the firststep  all States should adhere to and abide by thesignificantly strengthened landmine Protocol to theConvention on conventional weapons. I find it very hard tounderstand why two out of three United Nations MemberStates continue to remain outside that Convention.As a concurrent step Finland proposes the initiation ofglobal negotiations on a treaty banning anti-personnellandmines altogether. A natural forum for such negotiationswould be the single negotiating body for disarmament thatthe international community has at its disposal  namely  theConference on Disarmament in Geneva.Finland will work actively for the inclusion of a banon anti-personnel landmines in the negotiating agenda ofthe Conference on Disarmament when the Conferencereconvenes in January.In assisting in the creation of conditions of stabilityand well-being  the United Nations has effective economicand social tools at its disposal. A review of how the UnitedNations does its business in this field is under way. Theapproval in May of the resolution on restructuring andrevitalization of some areas in the Economic and SocialCouncil sector was an encouraging sign.The yardstick in measuring United Nations impacton development should be how the Organization has beenable to alleviate poverty and contribute to theimprovement of the quality of life. The first priority now as we see it  should be to assess the impact of thedevelopment activities of the United Nations system at thecountry level. We were pleased to note that last year theGeneral Assembly initiated a process to that effect.I have two remarks in this regard. First  it isnecessary to concentrate United Nations developmentactivities on the poorest countries and the most vulnerablegroups of society. Secondly  better integration of theUnited Nations at the country level would enhanceefficiency. It would promote closer coordination betweendevelopment activities  on the one hand  and humanitarianand peacekeeping activities on the other.The commitments made at recent United Nationsconferences provide a comprehensive agenda forfollow-up. One of the conferences  the United NationsConference on Environment and Development  will beprominently present at this fifty-first session of theGeneral Assembly. That Conference is a promisingexample of the capabilities of the United Nations. It hasmade global environmental concerns an everyday realityfor all of us. The follow-up session next year will afforda unique opportunity to assess progress and reviewpriorities.In my view  one of the emerging priorities would bea political commitment at the global level for sustainableforest management. Finland attaches great importance tothe Intergovernmental Panel on Forests  which has beenestablished and which expects to submit concrete action-oriented recommendations to the special session.Before concluding my statement  I wish to refer tothe statement issued by the Presidency of the EuropeanUnion yesterday regarding the killings and violentincidents in the West Bank and Gaza. I want to state thatmy Government fully endorses that statement. On behalfof the Government of Finland  I appeal to the partiesconcerned to take every measure to restore calm andrefrain from acts of violence and provocation. We alsourge the parties to re-engage the peace process  which hadalready achieved such promising results.5In view of the Security Council’s primary role in themaintenance of international peace and security  the reformof the Council is of particular urgency. The discussions onthis subject during the fiftieth session were thorough anduseful. Convergence of views emerged on many importantissues  yet on others  differences still remain. I believe thatthe time is now ripe to take a step forward and engage inreal negotiations on a comprehensive reform of the Council.Meanwhile  in a few weeks we shall elect new non-permanent members to the present Security Council. As iswell known  the five Nordic Countries give their fullsupport to Sweden. I am confident that the other MemberStates will also recognize the merits of our neighbouringcountry.The Deputy Prime Minister of Ireland  Mr. DickSpring  when speaking on behalf of the European Union underlined the obligation of all Member States to pay theirarrears and their assessed contributions to the UnitedNations. Finland having been the first Member State to payin full  on time and without conditions its assessedcontribution to the regular budget of the United Nations in1996  I feel it both my right and my duty to reiterate thatappeal.The United Nations  we agree  needs renewed focusand streamlining. Let us now find the determination andwill to proceed with the necessary reform."
"56",2376,"FJI",51,1996,"﻿My delegation joins others in warmlycongratulating Ambassador Razali Ismail on his election tothe presidency of the fifty-first session of the GeneralAssembly. His election is indeed  and in fact  a tributeboth to him and to his great country  Malaysia. I wouldassure him of my delegation’s full cooperation during histenure of office.It also gives me great pleasure to extend theprofound gratitude of my delegation to the outgoingPresident of the historic fiftieth session of the GeneralAssembly  Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral of Portugal  whopresided over the session with such great skill  dexterityand expertise.Lasting peace and security on our planet are the verycornerstones of progress and prosperity in our nationStates. They are the cornerstones of accelerateddevelopment  to which we all  developing and leastdeveloped countries  aspire.Mankind has fervently sought to live in peace andsecurity throughout the ages  but lasting peace andsecurity in our world have been very elusive  particularlyduring this century. In the early part of this century  webecame embroiled in the First World War. We all thoughtthat that was the war to end all wars  and then came theSecond World War  two decades later. It was the worstdestructive war of our times  and it left many challengesto peace and security in its wake.The end of the war saw our world bipolarized andbusy with the pursuit of spheres of influence by the twosuper-Powers  which culminated in a new era  the cold-war era. Prospects for peace and security in our worldfaded as the super-Powers and other major Powers begana race for the production and stockpiling of new weaponsof war and mass destruction.The world entered a new phase  the nuclear age when several Powers began to develop  test and producenuclear weapons. The testing of those weapons to makethem even more powerful took place in many parts of theworld  including my country’s own region in the SouthPacific. In such a milieu  peace and security became aconstant prayer but a distant hope  as many of us in thenon-nuclear world were filled with foreboding that ourworld was on the brink of nuclear extinction.In such a horrific scenario  common sense began toprevail  and that common sense  buoyed by the initiativesof this important Organization  the United Nations  led tothe conclusion of several important but limited treatiesand to the Conference on Disarmament. Those initiatives12were ultimately crowned with success when  on 10September 1996  in an extended fiftieth session of theUnited Nations General Assembly  the vast majority of theworld’s nations adopted the text of a ComprehensiveNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty  the CTBT.In the context of the South Pacific region  with theadoption of the CTBT  the signature by the United Statesof America  the United Kingdom and France of theProtocols to the South Pacific Nuclear-Free-Zone Treaty —the Treaty of Rarotonga — and the ratification by Franceof the Protocols  my country and the countries of the regioncan breathe a sigh of relief at the cessation of the assault onour environment. Now our Governments can focus on theeconomic and social utilization of our natural resources toimprove and increase the standard of living of our peopleswithout having to worry as much as we have in the pastabout the effects nuclear testing was having on the healthof our people and the environment of the region. To furtherenhance this positive and welcome development  we urgethe United States and the United Kingdom to ratify theProtocols to the South Pacific Nuclear-Free-Zone Treaty.My country hails the adoption of the CTBT as one ofthe greatest achievements of the international communitythis century. It represents an imposing foundation for theestablishment of lasting peace and security in our world.The CTBT may not be the paragon of virtue most ofus probably expected it to be. It is  nevertheless  a bold andconstructive initiative that is meaningful and at the sametime a reassurance of our survival of the nuclear menace.All of us must take the responsibility of assuring thesuccess of the Treaty. My country calls on all nations of theworld  in the interest of lasting peace and security on ourplanet and in the interest of all mankind  to sign and ratifythe CTBT. Fiji signed the CTBT the day it was opened forsignature. My Government has already decided to ratify it.In the final analysis  we do not see the adoption of theCTBT as the final nail in the coffin of nuclear weapons. Toachieve our ultimate and pre-eminent aim and our desire forlasting peace and security in our world  my country wouldlike to see the CTBT as merely the first step towards anend to the production of all nuclear weapons  an end to thestockpiling of all nuclear weapons  the ultimate destructionof all nuclear weapons  the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free world and general disarmament as a whole.Today  while we rejoice with a degree of relief at theadoption and signing of the CTBT  it is at the same timealso incumbent upon us not to relax our vigilance withregard to the moves and proposals in certain quarters toimport and dump nuclear waste and other forms ofhazardous waste in our region. I refer specifically toreported plans afoot by certain unscrupulous nuclear-waste dealers to use the Palmyra Islands and certain othersites in the Pacific as permanent disposal facilities fornuclear waste.My country wishes to make it clear to all concernedthat we in the Pacific region will not sit idly by and allowany further reckless and mindless destruction of ourenvironment and detriment to the health of our peoplethrough any form of nuclear contamination.The stark reality of international affairs in our worldtoday is that total nuclear disarmament and generaldisarmament  or even accelerated movement towardsthose goals  will not end tensions and conflicts and threatsto peace. Even when weapons were made of stone tensions  threats to peace and conflicts existed. And whenwe look at the events that are happening at present in anumber of countries around us  my country recognizes and I am sure we all do  that we must create in ourinternational life a system of preventive diplomacy thatcan respond promptly  positively  peacefully andeffectively to potential conflicts and threats of genocide and de-escalate internal tensions and threats to internaland regional peace. My country wishes to recall itsrecommendation to the fiftieth session of the GeneralAssembly that earnest and urgent action should be takento set up a special United Nations department or unit topursue preventive diplomacy in conflict prevention andconflict resolution. The department  in collaboration withcompetent countries and authorities  should have thecapacity to receive  collate  analyse and interpretintelligence information and reports with a view to earlydetection of potential conflicts and early reaction tocontain  minimize and resolve such conflicts incollaboration with relevant Member States. We shouldtake every step within our power to prevent fires ratherthan having to put them out  to save lives rather thanhaving to condemn the loss of lives.Accordingly  my country welcomes the offer madeby Norway in the General Assembly to establish a fundfor preventive action at the United Nations and thatcountry’s pledge to provide some financial contribution tothe fund annually.In our efforts to promote  establish and maintainpeace and security in our world  it is incumbent upon us13to recognize and realize that security has severaldimensions  not the least of which is economic security.Sluggish economic development and limiteddevelopment growth have affected developing countries andin particular  small island States  threatening nationalregional stability in one way or another. My countrytherefore calls on the international community  first  toincrease official development assistance and to improve thequality of such assistance to developing countries; secondly to cooperate in the creation of a more equitableinternational economic environment and thereby help topromote sustained economic growth and sustainabledevelopment  and at the same time  help to eradicatepoverty; thirdly  to dismantle trade barriers and restrictionsto market access; fourthly  to improve the access ofdeveloping countries to capital from international financialinstitutions and commercial sources; and lastly  to facilitateand assist the flow of investment capital and appropriatetechnologies to developing countries.We have noted with concern that donor countries havefailed to comply with the internationally agreed targets ofofficial development assistance and commitments for newand additional resources. There is urgent need for asubstantial expansion of official development assistance andfor qualitative improvements in official developmentassistance by donor countries through a reduced cost ofrepayment. In fact  my country has noted with deep regretthat while some developed countries have been makingefforts to meet the official development assistance level such assistance from some rich countries has been decliningnoticeably  and the decline has been taking place in thepost-cold-war era  when it was to be expected that suchcountries were in a better position to increase the flow ofofficial development assistance as a result of greaterstability in the world and reduced tensions between formerantagonists. In fact  in the case of a few traditional donors aid has almost completely dried up. In some cases  aid isbeing systematically reduced. It appears that our region isno longer a strategic area for competition by the formercold-war antagonists to gain our favour.My country is concerned to see the recent trend insome countries to seek to impose alien norms on countrieswith a unique  traditional and customary nature of society especially indigenous societies. On the other hand  withrespect to Japan and some South-East Asian countries suchas Malaysia  development assistance is provided with nointention of interfering in their internal affairs.International cooperation for development lies at thevery heart of improving the living conditions of the greatmajority of people in our world who live in developingand least developed countries. My country fully supportsan Agenda for Development  which is aimed at restoringthe imperative of development as a central concern. Suchan agenda should contain specific  concrete and pragmaticproposals that could be translated into action programmesand implemented on the basis of global priorities.The Agreement amending the fourth LoméConvention between the countries of Africa  theCaribbean and the Pacific and the European Community signed in Mauritius on 4 November 1995  includes aSecond Financial Protocol that ensures that the EuropeanDevelopment Fund will be available for developmentprojects in African  Caribbean and Pacific countries up tothe end of February 2000. This commitment by theEuropean Union is a direct endorsement of a multilateralaccord and a North-South development instrument thathas worked and that has been widely acclaimedthroughout the world. Many critics are predicting the endof Lomé by the year 2000. However  within theCommunity itself  and within the 70 African  Caribbeanand Pacific States  the idea of a successor agreement toLomé IV is a fait accompli. That in itself is a firm andunambiguous recognition of the dire need for such aninstrument beyond the year 2000.It is therefore our — and indeed everyone’s —responsibility to protect and defend the principles andphilosophy behind an accord such as the LoméConvention. Those who are carried along by theliberalization of the so-called winds of change that aresweeping through the continents must realize that parts ofour international community will still require preferentialarrangements in the interest of economic and politicalparity and of equity  peace and stability in the world.It is sad to note that the developed countries have sofar failed to fulfil their commitments to provide new andadditional financial resources and technology transfer tothe developing countries on favourable terms. Theimplementation of such commitments is most necessaryfor international economic cooperation  as is meaningfuland effective follow-up to major conferences.My country calls for the prompt and fullimplementation of the commitments and recommendationsof the United Nations Conference on Environment andDevelopment (UNCED)  which are more relevant todaythan ever before. We believe that under UNCED14developing countries should have the right to benefit fullyfrom the utilization of their natural resources if they are toachieve sustained economic growth and maintainsustainable development.We wish to highlight the continuing urgent need topromote and facilitate industrialization as an instrument tofacilitate rapid economic and social development indeveloping countries  which will contribute to theelimination of poverty and the generation of productiveemployment. The strengthening of the industrial bases ofdeveloping and least developed countries should become aninternational imperative.My country calls on the international community toensure an open  rule-based  equitable  secure  non-discriminatory  transparent and predictable multilateraltrading system with the aim of achieving the completeintegration of the developing countries into the worldeconomy and the new international trading system.We call upon Member States to implement fully thecommitments agreed to in the Final Act adopted by theWorld Trade Conference  which confers special anddifferential treatment on developing countries. We believethat the carefully balanced package of rights and obligationswith respect to the World Trade Organization should becarefully preserved and that the essential priority should bethe implementation and fulfilment of such rights andobligations and the adoption of measures to mitigateadverse consequences on the developing countries.The present unfair trading system is stagnating theeconomies of small island States when the internationalcommunity is committed to protecting them. Fiji hasderegulated its economy and its trade system  but we aredeterred in our efforts to gain access to the markets ofsome developed countries  which still retain regulatorybarriers of one kind or other.My country therefore warmly welcomes the statementby the British Foreign Minister in this Assembly that thedeveloped world must demolish the barriers it stillmaintains against imports from the developing world andthe concomitant commitment to bring a vision of globalfree trade to reality by the year 2020.It is sad to note that the debt crisis persists as one ofthe main constraints to development in developingcountries. We wish to stress the urgent need for theinternational community  particularly donor countries andinternational financial institutions  to adopt an effective comprehensive and equitable development-oriented anddurable solution to the debt problem of developingcountries.My country strongly supports the World FoodSummit to be held at Rome next month. It is the firsttime that world leaders will meet to debate and renew acommitment to eradicate hunger and malnutrition and toaddress the issues of food security for all peoples throughthe adoption of policies and actions at the national subregional  regional and international levels.As we pursue initiatives on several fronts to promoteand facilitate lasting peace and security in our world  wehave to be mindful of areas of tension that existconcurrently.The Washington Middle East peace summit hascome and gone  but at least it succeeded in bringingtogether the leader of Israel and the Palestinian leader indialogue and discussion. We urge the parties to pursue ina meaningful way the initiative set in motion by theWashington summit. We also urge continued restraint byall. Killing and lamentations may have become anestablished way of life in the region  but peace andpeaceful coexistence are the only civilized way towardsprogress and prosperity for all. We call upon the partiesto undertake genuine and constructive action to negotiate achieve and maintain a just and lasting peace in theMiddle East.The Dayton accords succeeded in bringing a halt toarmed hostilities in war-torn Bosnia. General electionshave been held  but the situation remains fragile and theconclusion is inescapable that the internationalpeacekeeping presence in Bosnia should remain for sometime to come to consolidate the gains that have beenachieved so far.Recent events in Cyprus have reminded us that thetense situation in that country persists  and my countrycontinues to urge all parties to accelerate the pace of thenegotiations in the interest of finding a constructive  justand lasting solution as early as possible.Recent events in the Straits of Taiwan havehighlighted the tension that exists in that region of theworld  a region which is otherwise currently witnessing amost dynamic economic growth. Both the People’sRepublic of China and Taiwan  which are also activeparticipants in post-forum dialogue with the islandcountries of the South Pacific Forum  contribute15significantly to the development of the South Pacific region.My country welcomes the spirit of cooperation betweenTaiwan and the People’s Republic of China and encouragesthe continuation of such dialogue and cooperation.The genocide in Rwanda and Burundi imposes anobligation on our community of nations to pursue everypossible initiative to prevent tragedies of such magnitudeand to avoid a recurrence whenever and wherever theyoccur  and not on a selective basis or to serve the self-interest of one or another major Power. The conclusion isinescapable that such problems should not be left entirelyto regional organizations to resolve  since they may haveneither the capacity nor the resources to deal effectivelywith the situation.My county condemns international terrorism and willfully support all international efforts and measures toeliminate international terrorism. We will also supportinitiatives to negotiate an international agreement to ban theuse  stockpiling  production and transfer of anti-personnelmines.We fully support international efforts in crimeprevention and criminal justice and are fully appreciative ofthe preparatory work being done on the establishment of aninternational criminal court.My country would like to reemphasize its strong viewthat the question of the protection and security of smallStates should remain a central concern of the UnitedNations. For as long as drug traffickers  international armsdealers  money launderers and international white-collarcriminals continue their criminal activities  and as long asmercenaries and terrorists exist  small States will remainvulnerable to acts of aggression from without as well asfrom within. Small States especially look to the provisionsof the United Nations Charter for the respect andpreservation of their sovereignty.My country continues to urge all parties to the UnitedNations Framework Convention on Climate Change tomove speedily towards the conclusion of an effectiveprotocol that would ultimately bring about improvements inthe global climate system. My country is one of the manythat is vulnerable to rising sea levels  hurricanes and otherphenomena associated with disastrous climate changes. Ourphysical survival could be affected if immediate action isnot taken to address the problem of climate changes in ourworld. The meeting of the South Pacific Forum held in theMarshall Islands from 3 to 5 September this yearhighlighted the Forum’s concern that climate change hasbecome a crucial issue within the region. It called — andwe share that call — for urgent action  particularly inview of the second assessment report of theIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  which statedthat the balance of scientific evidence suggested adiscernible human influence on the global climate. TheForum welcomed the outcome of the second session ofthe Conference of the Parties to the FrameworkConvention on Climate Change and called for accelerationof negotiations on the text of a legally binding protocol oranother legal instrument to be completed in time foradoption at the third session of the Conference of Partiesin order to achieve significant progress towards the goalof lower greenhouse-gas emissions.The South Pacific Forum also called upon allcountries to support the activities of the Ad Hoc Groupon the Berlin Mandate and reaffirmed its support for theinclusion of the draft protocol presented by the Allianceof Small Island States for consideration in the negotiatingprocess.My country warmly welcomes the recentestablishment of the International Seabed Authority andthe election of the judges of the International Tribunal forthe Law of the Sea. These new developments  togetherwith the successful completion last year of the UnitedNations Conference on Straddling Fish Stocks and HighlyMigratory Fish Stocks  will maintain the momentum inthe implementation of the Law of the Sea Convention. Inparticular  we support the promotion of the regime for thesustainable utilization of the living resources of the sea.It is our sincere hope that the International SeabedAuthority will administer the resources of the sea for thebenefit of mankind. My country calls on the internationalcommunity and the United Nations  in accordance withthe decision of the General Assembly taken in July 1994to provide adequate funding and adequate technicalsupport to the International Seabed Authority so that itcan competently discharge in a most effective andefficient manner the responsibilities we gave it under theConvention. My delegation is pleased to be a sponsor ofa draft resolution seeking the granting of observer statusin the United Nations for the International SeabedAuthority.The United Nations has done a remarkable andexcellent job in carrying out its mandates during the 51years of its existence. It has played a significant discernible and indispensable role in human affairs  fromthe peaceful resolution of conflicts and peacekeeping to16economic development and social progress  from food andagriculture to employment and labour standards  fromhelping the children of our world to fostering human rightsand justice. The international community is deeply indebtedto the United Nations  which should continue to be a forumfor multilateral cooperation and not an instrument thatmajor Powers may use to serve their own national self-interests. My country acknowledges with profound gratitudethe assistance and cooperation it has been receiving fromthe United Nations in its national and regional developmentefforts. Fiji continues to pledge its commitment to theUnited Nations and to what it stands for.It is appropriate to observe  however  that in order torespond to the many demands of this complex world inwhich we all live  the United Nations has had to expand.Over a period of years  it has become very heavy  therebygreatly increasing the cost of its operation. The unhealthystate of United Nations finances does not derive  however solely from the Organization’s enhanced and expandingstructure. It has also been exacerbated by the non-paymentof dues and assessments. We call on all Member States thathave not paid their dues or assessments and are in arrearsto pay them promptly  fully and without conditions.My country appreciates the steps taken this year by theUnited Nations administration to improve management  tomake services more efficient and more effective and to cutcosts. Notwithstanding the action that has been taken  mycountry believes that more can and should be done to makethe Organization leaner and more streamlined and at thesame time to reduce costs further. The various organs agencies and departments of the United Nations need to berationalized in line with the modalities of today’s world and structural changes and more personnel reforms must beinstituted to make it more responsive to the constantdemands of a continuously changing internationalcommunity.My country believes that the scale of assessments forthe apportionment of expenses should be reassessed tomake it more equitable and less burdensome for smallisland States.My country believes that the time has come for thereform of the Security Council. We submit  as we did lastyear  that the organs of the United Nations should reflectchanges in the global political landscape as well as theprinciples of geographic representation and equity. TheSecurity Council should  in our view  be enlarged toaccommodate the existing global political landscape.Since peace and security underpin the veryfoundation of this Organization  my country fully supportsthe international peacekeeping missions of the UnitedNations. We are committed to the maintenance ofinternational peace and security and  despite the fact thatwe are a small  developing island State with a smallpopulation  we have actively participated in the vastmajority of United Nations peacekeeping missions. Fijiansoldiers are serving in the Middle East with both theUnited Nations Interim Force in Lebanon and theMultinational Force and Observers  as well as in Iraq andKuwait. They have served in Afghanistan  Somalia and inRwanda. Our policemen  too  have served in Angola Cambodia  Namibia and Iraq  and are currently serving inEastern Slavonia and in Croatia. Several of our men havelost their lives in the service of the internationalcommunity and in the pursuit of peace and security in ourworld.Peacekeeping is the responsibility of all MemberStates  whether they contribute troops and personnel ornot. We therefore urge all countries concerned to expeditethe settlement of the assessments for peacekeeping due tothe United Nations. And in turn  we urge the UnitedNations expeditiously and fully to settle the amounts orarrears outstanding to Member countries for theirparticipation in peacekeeping operations.As I stated previously  international security hasmany dimensions. The security of the world’s indigenouspeoples is one such dimension. The history of the world’sindigenous peoples is replete with wholesale slaughter genocide and  in some cases  total annihilation during theera of exploration  discovery and colonization.The Prime Minister of Fiji  the Honourable SitiveniRabuka  told the United Nations last year that it:“must guarantee that external values and forces donot continue to coerce political concessions economic reforms and social changes not desired byindigenous peoples themselves”. (Official Records ofthe General Assembly  Fiftieth Session  PlenaryMeetings  40th meeting  p. 49)At the opening of the regional workshop on the draftUnited Nations declaration on the rights of indigenouspeoples held in Fiji last month  the Prime Minister of Fijideclared that:17“In our Pacific home  we have been sole proprietorsin most places for no less than three thousand years;in most other places  for much longer.”Our Prime Minister stated that it must be legallyaccepted that:“We are the first settlers  first dwellers or proprietorsof our land. Secondly  we are a collective group thatwas imposed upon by uninvited external forces whodisrupted the normal march of our history. As victimsof what continues to be described as imperialism andcolonialism  we cannot  in our quest for freedom allow the vestiges of foreign domination to encroachupon us  either through internal machinations orexternal collusion.”The Fiji workshop agreed in principle that  whereverpossible  efforts to strengthen the text of the current draftdeclaration should be encouraged. The unanimous view ofthe workshop was that efforts by States to undermine theexisting language of the draft should be actively resisted byindigenous peoples. The workshop further resolved thatPacific indigenous peoples should seek to promote greatersupport for the draft declaration within the United Nationssystem so that the overall objective of achieving aneffective and meaningful declaration on indigenous peoplesis reached.My country  which has had a multiracial populationfor the last 150 years  warmly welcomes the observance ofthe International Decade of the World’s Indigenous People.We strongly urge  during the International Decade  theadoption of the declaration on the rights of indigenouspeoples. My country believes that the declaration should notbe the alpha and the omega of indigenous rights  but shouldbe merely a first step towards the negotiation  under theauspices of the United Nations  of a comprehensive legalconvention on the rights of indigenous peoples.Tension and fears among the indigenous people in Fijiled to the military overthrow of the Government in 1987and the promulgation of a new Constitution in 1990 by aninterim Government. That Constitution provided indigenousFijians majority representation in Parliament. ThatConstitution was reviewed by a three-member commissionheaded by Sir Paul Reeves of New Zealand. After over 12months of review  the commission recently submitted itsreport and recommendations to the Government. TheGovernment has duly submitted the report to Parliamentand a Select Committee  comprising representatives of allthe political parties in Parliament  has been appointed toconsider the Commission’s report and recommendations.Lasting peace and security in our world has been anillusion for the greater part of this century. With the newglobal changes  with our recent adoption of the CTBT with rising optimism regarding the Conference onDisarmament  with what can be perceived as a genuinedesire for peace  and with more meaningful internationalcollaboration in the areas of economic cooperation anddevelopment  there is some hope for achieving lastingpeace and security in our world."
"57",2423,"FRA",51,1996,"﻿My country is especially pleased at thePresident’s election to lead the General Assembly. Herepresents a great country that plays an important role inthe Non-Aligned Movement and the Group of 77 and Iam glad that he is to preside over our work during thiscrucial period for our Organization.17I should also like to endorse the remarks made byIreland’s Foreign Minister in the name of the EuropeanUnion.Last year  we celebrated the first half century of theUnited Nations existence  during which its energies weredevoted  with a success universally acknowledged  to theorganization of international society. A mammoth collectiveundertaking has been accomplished and the United Nationshas become the keystone of an international system foundedon law and the peaceful settlement of conflicts. Thiscollective undertaking owes much to the determined actionof successive Secretaries-General  and I should like to paya special and warm tribute here to Mr. Boutros-Ghali whose determination  vision of the future and firmness havegiven our Organization a presence and vitality rarelyachieved. He deserves our confidence.Today  as the century reaches its turning point  theOrganization is confronted with another major challenge:globalization. In every sphere  the ideas and realities towhich we were accustomed are changing at a paceunequalled in human history. The movement of people  ofideas and images  and of goods is accelerating as distancesshrink. At the same time  the standardization of culturalpractices — and the legitimate reactions this provokes —the general spread of low-cost high technologies andintensified competition bring into question the positions thathave been achieved and the functioning  if not the veryfoundation  of international society. At the same time  theproduction of wealth is increasing tenfold and scientificprogress is growing rapidly  while unexpected opportunitiesfor development are being given to new nations.But these benefits have adverse effects. The controlfragile States have over their development is being eroded national legislation is becoming inapplicable and the notionof territorial integrity is changing in meaning. In short national authorities are too often reduced to powerlessnessby transnational phenomena over which they have onlyscant control. If we are not careful  we are going to beliving in a world without criteria  without values  withoutreferences  in which some — the strongest and therichest — will be in a position to decide alone on the futureof the planet. It should come as no surprise that  in thesecircumstances  the United Nations has many detractors.Our Organization is in effect a privileged forum inwhich the framework of a genuine international society canbe built  a framework that frees the forces of creativity anddevelopment and represses the forces of violence andoppression. It is up to all of us present here to enable theUnited Nations to play that role and to ensure peace security and progress in these new circumstances and inkeeping with its mandate. Rest assured that France  afounding Member of the Organization and permanentmember of the Security Council  will devote all itsenergies to this task and will be in the front ranks of thisnew fight.Our world is confronted today with terrible problemsthat know no borders and  sadly  spare no population:terrorism  crime and drugs. The fight against thesescourges is foremost in our concerns and high on theinternational agenda. Accordingly  an uncompromisingfight against terrorism  whatever its forms  perpetratorsand motives  constitutes our priority. This is why Iconvened a conference on terrorism in Paris last July thatbrought together the G-7 countries and Russia. Weadopted 25 practical  specific recommendations. They willbe implemented by each State and will strengtheninternational cooperation against terrorism. Therefore today I make a solemn call on the entire internationalcommunity to join wholeheartedly in this fight.We must also react without weakness to thechallenge of organized crime  in the knowledge that itknows how to make the fullest use of the possibilities thathave been opened up by the liberalization of trade. For itis the very foundation of our societies and institutions thatit endangers today.International cooperation is indispensable to stemthis phenomenon. France  pursuing the path mapped outby the Canadian presidency  has drafted a corpus of legaland operational recommendations with its G-7 partnersand Russia to improve the effectiveness of the fightagainst this scourge. These should guide in particular theaction of the States most affected by transnationalorganized crime. France recently strengthened its financiallegislation against money-laundering. All States shouldpay particular attention to this phenomenon  which is oneof the hardest forms of organized crime to counter.One of the most loathsome aspects of organizedcrime is that which targets our children. A world summiton combating the sexual exploitation of children wasrecently held in Stockholm. That is good  but it is still notenough. Everyone must now make a commitment toimplementing effective measures for immediateapplication. I urge all States represented here to actquickly and with determination in this area which  morethan any other  affects our future. The Assembly may restassured of France’s political resolve.18Drugs are a formidable threat today because of theravages they inflict on young people. Internationalcooperation must be solid. The producer and consumercountries must recognize their shared responsibility. Theinternational community must therefore continue to pursueconvergent policies to reduce the supply of illegalsubstances and the demand for them. The European Unionhas chosen such a global policy and has launched large-scale actions in close coordination with internationalinstitutions  in particular the United Nations InternationalDrug Control Programme. France strongly supports theproposal to convene a special session of the GeneralAssembly devoted to drugs in 1998.These new perils do not supplant the traditionalchallenges  which our Organization must address withsustained vigilance and unwavering firmness. Peace-keepingremains the central function of our Organization under theterms of the founding Charter. The mission of the UnitedNations to soothe tensions  separate combatants and resolveconflicts remains fundamental.The panoply of available instruments is becomingmore diversified. Recent additions to conventional peace-keeping missions include activities to consolidate peace preventive diplomacy measures and even regionalconferences — such as I hope will soon take place withregard to the situation in the Great Lakes region.Sanctions constitute one of these instruments. They area useful weapon  but they penalize populations and musttherefore be used with prudence and moderation  followstrict criteria and — I stress this — always be limited intime. Only under those conditions can sanctions  which aresometimes necessary to prevent something worse  continueto be used by our Organization with the requiredlegitimacy.Of course  we cannot refer to the traditional challengesto peace without speaking about current regional conflicts.In Bosnia and Herzegovina  where my country has paid aheavy tribute  France is pleased that elections could be held imperfect though they were. That represents an essentialstage in the return to peace provided for by the agreementssigned in Paris in 1995.But peace still has to be consolidated  devastatedterritories be reconstructed  refugees encouraged to returnand a civilian society rebuilt. To that end  France hasproposed a plan of consolidated action by the internationalcommunity with a time-frame of two years. With this goalin mind  we will very shortly be hosting an internationalconference in Paris to examine  and I hope adopt  thisproposal.Similarly  the peace process in the Middle Eastseems to be at a crucial stage. I wish here to express myanxiety about it. I certainly believe the process to beirreversible  but I am also aware of the precariousness ofthe gains and the urgency of the need for long-termsolutions. We are half-way there. I say “we”  because thisprocess concerns not just Arabs and Israelis but all of ushere.For France  peace in the Middle East is built upondialogue between equal partners  respect for the identityof each and the right of peoples to the free determinationof their destiny  the affirmation of their independence  andsecurity. That is why — and I wish to emphasize thispoint — France believes that there will be no lastingpeace in the region  based on an exchange of land forpeace  unless the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination is respected  together with their legitimateaspirations for a State.We believe that a just and balanced agreementbetween Israelis and Palestinians cannot avoid the issuesof Jerusalem  refugees and the settlements in thePalestinian territories. Finally  a lasting peace presupposesthat Israel is assured of its existence within secure andrecognized borders.France believes that complete withdrawal from theGolan Heights in exchange for total peace constitutes thebasis of an agreement between Syria and Israel  and thatLebanon must regain full and complete sovereignty overthe whole of its territory.Based on these principles  France intends to have agreater and more active presence than ever in the MiddleEast  with which it has close and long-standing relations.It will pursue this policy in close consultation with itsEuropean partners. Furthermore  Europe must have aplace  alongside the two sponsors of the peace process commensurate with the major contribution it is making tothe region’s development.While we are endeavouring to build peace in areasin crisis  our efforts are no less ambitious for the entireEuropean continent. In building step by step what we callan “architecture of security“  we are really offering theinternational community a pillar of peace. France ismaking an important contribution to the establishment on19the European continent a system of global security thatleaves no one out on the edge.The construction of peace in Europe began with theconstruction of European institutions. It is being continuedby deepening the Union. The intergovernmental Conferencerepresents a decisive stage in this process  the forerunner ofexpansion  which is vital to the stability and prosperity ofthe continent.France wishes to see the Union go still further bygiving substance to the European identity in security anddefence matters. To that end  we would like to see astrengthening of the Western European Union and itsgradual rapprochement with the European Union.The European identity is also based on the reform ofthe Atlantic Alliance. France  after taking a decisive step is now working actively with its allies on the adaptation ofstructures. This should allow the emergence of a genuineEuropean security and defence identity within the Allianceand make it possible in practice for the Western EuropeanUnion  and therefore the European Union  to use the assetsof the Alliance for military action that Europeans decide toundertake themselves. This reform is also the key to theprocess of expanding the Alliance  with which France isready to assist. That expansion must naturally go hand-in-hand with in-depth dialogue and cooperation with Russia.The third and last aspect of the structure is theOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe(OSCE)  which is the sole forum for security in which allthe European States are represented on an equal footing.That is why France believes that it is necessary tostrengthen the organization. We hope that the Lisbonsummit will provide the occasion to move towards thedrafting of a charter or treaty linking all the States of thecontinent.Important events therefore await us on the path thatwe have mapped out  including the OSCE summit inDecember and the NATO summit next year. The lattershould bring together all the European States for a“pan-Europe day”  demonstrating the community of securityinterests of all the countries on the continent  includingRussia and our North American allies whose role inEuropean security remains decisive. That is our ambitionfor a Europe of security that leaves no one out and is saferand more stable for the entire international community.In this changing world  it is for the United Nations tobring out the common values that will be the foundationsof civilization in the twenty-first century. It is thanks toits actions that we hope to build a safer  less harsh worldfor its inhabitants. First  we hope it will be a world inwhich the spectre of nuclear war has faded. For manyyears  public opinion called for a complete ban on nucleartests. It was a hope and a plan that was certainly worthy but remained blocked by the reality of East-Westconfrontation.France welcomes the signing of the ComprehensiveNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty  which I had the honour to signyesterday. This Treaty marks a major turning-point in theworld’s strategic balances.It puts an end to the possibility of the nuclear-weapon States’ developing new types of nuclear weapons and it makes a decisive contribution to the fight againstnuclear-weapon proliferation.The Treaty thus opens the way to a more stable safer world which will cease to be haunted by the twindangers of the nuclear-arms race and the proliferation ofthese weapons.There is another development which I findremarkable: the endorsement of human rights as a majorprinciple of international relations. And the UnitedNations is at the centre of this development.I should like in this regard to pay tribute to theremarkable work done by the Commission on HumanRights. In often difficult circumstances  it has pursuedwith pragmatism and tenacity its patient efforts to awakenconsciences  to galvanize energies and to promote the ruleof law in concrete ways.Our aim must not be to pronounceexcommunications or establish a blacklist  generally to noeffect. Rather  it must be to promote the protection ofindividuals and the progress of law with due respect fordifferences.I should also like to reaffirm France’s determinationto see crimes against humanity punished. Thecondemnation they warrant cannot brook any exception.Together with others  France took the initiative ofproposing the establishment of the international criminalTribunal and the international Tribunal for Rwanda. Iwish to reaffirm France’s unqualified support for theirfounding work  and its backing in order that the tribunalsmight carry out their work in full.20Lastly  France is pleased that the foundations that havethus been laid have helped to speed up the debates on theestablishment of an international criminal court  which weearnestly desire and to which we attach a high priority.There are other important areas which we have begunto consider.At this time when workers  money  factories andcommerce operate at a heightened pace  it is essential todevelop dialogue among the partners of economic life. Thisis really the only solid basis on which to build socialprotection that preserves the interests of all without harmingthe growth of economies.The fiftieth anniversary of the International LabourOrganisation (ILO) provided the opportunity to recall theessential role of this organization in defining these minimalnorms  without which the economic world is but a vastjungle.Universality  however  must not lead to uniformity.The definition of common values  accepted by all  is basedon respect for the identities that underpin the cultures of theworld. Our values will thus command all the more respectfor being expressed in all our respective languages.Accordingly  we welcome the fact that the GeneralAssembly last year adopted a resolution on multilingualismby a very large majority. Our civilizations  languages andcultures  inherited from an often turbulent history  but ofirreplaceable richness  are a precious legacy for humankind.The importance that my country ascribes to theFrench-speaking community reflects its determination tomaintain the specificity and richness of the profoundlyoriginal world view of several hundreds of millions ofpeople. We will not give this up.The search for a new world ethic is not limited tohuman rights but extends to the whole of international life.Since 1945  international trade has been a powerful growthfactor  contributing to a large extent to the expansion of theindustrialized economies and to the success of the so-calledemerging countries. But here too we must have rules of thegame  acknowledged at the world level  so as to developand regulate trade  ensure that it is fair and preventunilateral conduct.I should like to mention here the dangers ofunilateralism. Unilateralism: behind this technocratic wordlurks the temptation to impose the law of the strongest atthe expense of dialogue and negotiation.France and Europe cannot accept that one country even if it is the most powerful  attempt to regulate worldtrade by itself by means of decisions that have extra-territorial scope. The World Trade Organization does notallow it  and no one should doubt the firmness of Frenchand European reactions were such measures actually to beimplemented.The globalization of the economy and theliberalization of trade and investments have opened upunprecedented prospects. However  we must take care notto allow the gap to widen between the nations that trade invest and derive profit from this new factor and thosethat remain on the sidelines of this new prosperity.Each nation is responsible for itself and must create through rigorous public management and compliance withits legislative rulings  optimum conditions for freeingprivate initiative  a factor in economic and commercialprogress. But I do not believe that one can leave tomarket forces alone the care of ensuring the developmentof the poorest nations.Here  too  the United Nations has an important roleto play. By its side  the wealthiest States must affirm theirsolidarity in a tangible way: actively and effectively  thissolidarity must assist the developing countries withoutbecoming a substitute for them. On the threshold of anew century  poverty and exclusion cannot constitute thesole prospects for two-thirds of humankind. France  for itspart  will not accept this.This commitment concerns Africa in particular where real prospects for progress are beginning toemerge.Africa has embarked with courage and perseveranceon the path to readjustment and recovery  which willenable it to find its place again in the great flows ofworld trade.For the first time in a long time  Africa’s growthrate has been on the order of 5 per cent these past twoyears  higher than its demographic expansion  very highthough it is. This is a reassuring sign  attributable to theefforts made by the African States themselves. They havebeen able to cut public deficits  establish realisticmonetary parities  open up their markets and movetowards regional integration and democratization. Such21achievements  which are the result of structural reforms seem to us to justify our confidence. France believes inAfrica’s future.Still  official development assistance must bemaintained and strengthened  but this assistance must be thesubject of many initiatives. France has taken suchinitiatives within the European Union  the AfricanDevelopment Bank  the International DevelopmentAssociation and the International Monetary Fund.Recently  at the summit of industrialized countriesheld in Lyons  my country reaffirmed the need to increaseaid to the poorest countries  asking for more generoustreatment of debt for them  and for a new global partnershipto be defined between the developing countries and themultilateral institutions.In this new world context  we have to consider theprogress that the United Nations needs to make to be ableto meet its responsibilities for the next century.France approves of the current discussions onimproving the representative character of the SecurityCouncil  in particular with respect to Germany  Japan andthe States of the South.Similarly  under the decisive impetus of the Secretary-General  the Organization has embarked on a vast effort forstructural reform  the first results of which are beginning toshow.It is not a matter of changing everything but of seeingthat every institution is in a position to make a usefulcontribution to the collective work in its own sphere.That is why the members of the G-7 have proposedputting the savings realized through reforms intodevelopment projects.France would like to see the reform of the UnitedNations economic and social sector concluded quickly so asto strengthen the overall coherence of the Organization. Tothat end  the roles and mandates of the specialized agenciesand commissions in particular should be better defined  andwaste and duplication eliminated.These proposals are dictated solely by the wish to helpthe United Nations better fulfil its mission of fightingpoverty and exclusion on a global scale.In the case of the United Nations budget  many of usare worried about the financial crisis that threatens toparalyse the United Nations. The European Union has putforward concrete proposals for overcoming this crisis. Itis now up to all States that have let their arrearsaccumulate to assume their responsibilities.Whatever some may say  the United Nations is stillone of our best chances for building a better world. Letus not spoil it."
"58",2449,"FSM",51,1996,"﻿Onceagain  it is my honour as Secretary for External Affairs ofthe Government of the Federated States of Micronesia toaddress the General Assembly.First  I wish to thank the former President  HisExcellency Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral  for hisenlightened and skilful leadership during the historic fiftiethsession of the General Assembly.As always  we acclaim the tireless dedication ofSecretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali who  throughoutthe time of our membership  has worked unceasingly tomake the United Nations a more effective instrument forthe betterment of our lives.The people of my country are particularly pleased thatyou  Mr. President  have been elected to lead this bodyduring its crucial fifty-first Session. Last year we celebratedthe fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations and took stockof its accomplishments during the first half-century. Nowwe begin in earnest to apply the commitments we madetowards the future of this Organization and the world.There may be no other single individual who has been asinstrumental or as effective in leading the world communityin recent years in the difficult search for common ground particularly on issues relating to environmentally sustainabledevelopment. We are heartened by your past achievementsand are thankful for your willingness to undertake an evengreater commitment as our President during this session.This is a year of strong reflection for the people of theFederated States of Micronesia. Ten years have passedsince we emerged from the United Nations trusteeshipsystem  and five years since we took our place as amember of the United Nations. During these years we haveworked hard to build our capacity to contribute  even as aremote small island State  to the advancement of ourcommon goals. Despite severely limited resources  both interms of personnel and finances  we have accorded highpriority to our participation in United Nations activities andto meeting our financial commitments to this Organization.It remains our strong belief that this priority has not beenmisplaced.At the time we joined the United Nations theworld’s attention was focusing on the global aspects ofprotection of the environment and on the necessaryinterrelationship between the environment anddevelopment. These were the subjects of the historic workat the Earth Summit in Rio in June 1992. Thanks in largepart to you  Mr. President  that landmark United NationsConference on Environment and Development (UNCED)gave us Agenda 21 and its associated mechanisms. Sincethen  much has been accomplished through the work ofmany institutions and individuals  such as the Commissionfor Sustainable Development and the Under-Secretary-General for Policy Coordination and SustainableDevelopment  Mr. Nitin Desai. We look forward to thespecial session of this body next year which will be heldto review progress during the first five years followingUNCED and to appraise the effectiveness of theinstitutions that have grown up around it.In the case of the Federated States of Micronesia this movement was very well timed. Just as our internalprocess of development began in earnest  we receivedguidance from Agenda 21 as to sustainability and theintegration of environmental protection and development.A short time later  at the Barbados Conference  which hadbeen mandated by UNCED  we participated in analysingthe barriers to development faced by all small islanddeveloping States.While we took encouragement from the internationaland regional aspects of Agenda 21 and the BarbadosProgramme of Action  we were also motivated tointegrate the Rio and Barbados outcomes into our ownnational policies regarding development. Today ourNational Council on Sustainable Development  chaired byour Vice-President  plays a central role in the formationof my country’s development policies. Since last year mycountry has been assisted by the World Bank  theInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) and the AsianDevelopment Bank in undertaking broad economic policyand governmental structural reforms with a view tostrengthening the private sector and optimizing efficiencyin the public sector. We are taking serious steps todownsize the public service workforce. At the same time measures are being taken to raise Government revenuesthrough tax-rate increases and support for the publicsector. All of our public utility services  includingtelecommunications  are being commercialized  while agood number of our public-works services are beingprivatized.For a small island developing country such as theFederated States of Micronesia  the condition andproductivity of our limited land areas  and of the seas thatsurround us  are key to our survival. Only in recent timeshave we  and others like us  come to realize thevulnerability and fragile nature of a world long taken forgranted. It is in the nature of islands to regard ourremoteness as our primary protection against all dangers.But the twentieth century has taught us how the land onwhich we live  and the resources of the sea on which wedepend  can be destroyed as a consequence of events thattake place far from our own shores. Thus  we arecompelled to raise our voice against long-standing actionsand practices throughout the world as well as within ourown region.As long ago as 1972  Principle 21 of the StockholmDeclaration established that national sovereignty can nolonger be asserted to justify actions that“cause damage to the environment of other States orof areas beyond (...) national jurisdiction.”(A/CONF.48/14/Rev.1  p. 5)The affirmative responsibility of States to ensure theavoidance of such damage is specifically reiterated inPrinciple 2 of the Rio Declaration on Environment andDevelopment. That responsibility is now recognized as adoctrine of generally accepted international law.Yet today we look back on a year during which  atbest  only mixed progress was made by the nations of theworld in discontinuing or regulating activities harmful tothe environment of others. Particularly in the region of thePacific Islands  our broad expanses and our helplesspopulations continue to attract the interest of those whohave dirty  dangerous business to conduct. With regard toclimate change  our rising sea level and strengthening stormactivity sound an ominous warning of a global situation thatwill engulf us if decisive action is not taken by the worldcommunity now. Yet  over the past year  the political willamong nations to adopt concrete measures has appeared  ifanything  to be diminishing in the face of self-interestedand determined manipulation of the very processes that weseek to apply.It is not my purpose  however  to point with gloomto a glass half-empty  for we do take encouragement fromthe ongoing hard work of thousands worldwide to addressa wide range of global security and environmental threats.We are greatly relieved at the abatement  for now  ofthe threat of nuclear war and by the cessation  finally  ofnuclear-weapon testing. We hail the overwhelmingmajority of United Nations Members that supported theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). TheFederated States of Micronesia took particular pride instanding with other sponsors of the recent resolutionadopted by the General Assembly at its fiftieth session because Pacific Islanders were among the first  and mayyet prove to be the last actual  not potential  victims ofone of history’s darkest periods. We congratulate the fivenuclear Powers on their major role in achieving thismilestone  and we call on all Members to join us insigning the Treaty  as I did here yesterday on behalf ofmy country. The CTBT is a major step towards the totalelimination of all nuclear weapons. We hold that to be theultimate objective and obligation of the internationalcommunity and the global environment.Another difficult problem associated with thetechnology of mass destruction and with the nuclear ageis the disposition of dangerous waste  by-products andcastoffs  which themselves pose very real risks of masscalamity to those unfortunate enough to be caught in thepath of accidents. We credit the honest intentions of thosewho insist upon carrying out movements of plutoniumand other hazardous materials throughout our region to doso as carefully as they can. We accept and rely upon theword of those who have brought their hazardous materialsto our region for destruction that they will conduct thisactivity only a little longer. We welcome the recentannouncement by the United States administration of itsopposition to plans to establish a nuclear-waste storagefacility on Palmyra Atoll in our region. But experiencehas shown that good intentions are not always sufficientprotection. We must also rely on global mechanisms suchas the Basel and London Conventions  and on regionalactions to establish zones of protection  such as under theNoumea Convention and the recently concluded WaiganiTreaty.I emphasize that the progress made in all these areasis not lost on us. However  if our children and theirchildren are to inherit a livable world  we must allsomehow find a way now to take seriously the messageof the Stockholm Declaration. We must face the hard factthat each time the preventive and precautionary principles5are placed on hold to allow some offending activity tocontinue “just a little longer ” the global resolve expressedat Rio and reflected in many actions since is seriouslyundermined. Glacial progress is better than no progress  butit is not enough where the stakes are literally apocalyptic.As much as we support the process of the FrameworkConvention on Climate Change  it appears that intensivenegotiations are leading in the direction of elaboratecompromises that might represent masterful diplomaticachievement  but fall far short of effectively addressing theConvention’s objective. Recently  at the second Conferenceof the Parties in Geneva  we witnessed a sorry spectacle inwhich a few delegations blocked the negotiators even fromtaking note of a critical and unanimous scientific finding namely that“there is a discernible human influence on the globalclimate”.It fell to the ministers in attendance to make their owndeclaration recognizing the obvious importance of this andother findings in the second Assessment Report of theInterdepartmental Panel on Climate Change.When there exists this degree of helplessness on thepart of a great majority to come to grips with a problem even after the denial factor has been laid to rest  one beginsto fear that we lack the capacity to save ourselves fromourselves. There is too little time remaining before the nextConference of the Parties in Kyoto  where it is anticipatedthat a protocol or other legal instrument will be adoptedthat sets specific targets and timetables for emissionsreductions beyond the year 2000. That action will determinewhether the Convention can indeed serve to address thethreat of global climate change. Yet  at this point  the onlyspecific suggested text  tabled by the Alliance of SmallIsland States  is regarded by some larger industrializedcountries to be overreaching  even as a first step. Theoutlook is not encouraging.Thanks to the work of the IPCC in producing itslandmark second Assessment Report  we now know thatdue to the inertia of the Earth’s climate system in adjustingto changed inputs  it is already too late to preventsignificant loss of land areas and habitability due to sea-level rise during the upcoming century. We must thereforebegin in earnest to contemplate measures to adapt to  anddefend against  these consequences. In order to implementsuch measures  island countries will require the financialand technological support of the industrialized world.Without it  tens of millions of people on islands and in low-lying coastal areas throughout the world are certain tobecome homeless. No longer can the world afford toleave the development of adaptation measures on the backburner. We must begin to act now.As a nation covering over 1 million square miles ofocean  we place great importance on the sustainable useand management of marine resources within and adjacentto our territorial limits. We are pleased with the entry intoforce of the United Nations Convention on the Law of theSea  which has provided us with a framework to dealwith many important issues in this field. The resultingmanagement mechanisms are of particular importance tothose of us surrounded entirely by oceans.Other encouraging events have included the openingfor signature of the Agreement on straddling fish stocksand highly migratory fish stocks in December 1995  andthe election last month of 21 judges for the InternationalTribunal for the Law of the Sea. Furthermore  we notewith great satisfaction the election in Kingston  Jamaica of an esteemed Pacific Islander  Mr. Satya Nandan of Fiji as the first Secretary-General of the International SeabedAuthority. With his election and the subsequent actions ofthe Assembly of the Authority last month  the Authorityis finally in place as called for in Part XI of theConvention. With a substantial percentage of the globalmineral resources lying beneath the surface of the oceans the International Seabed Authority has a crucial role inensuring that the ocean environment is protectedthroughout the process of exploitation. In this connection it is important for the General Assembly to provideadequate financial resources to the International SeabedAuthority during this session  as it has done with otherbodies  until States Parties can assume the responsibilitynext year.One of the great learning experiences we have hadduring our early years of United Nations membership hasbeen appreciating the need for us all  collectively  to act by example and with determination  to alleviate thesuffering of people  wherever they are  who are deniedtheir basic rights as human beings. The Constitution ofthe Federated States of Micronesia reflects in itsDeclaration of Rights the standards ingrained in ourculture over many centuries  and it has perhaps given usa certain sense of complacency in this area. But we havecome to appreciate that the worldwide collective effort toconfront human rights issues both strengthens our ownsociety and affords us an opportunity to participate inhelping others.6Despite the inevitable impact of increased contactswith modern Western society  the most important aspectsand values of our traditional cultures remain strong  becausethey are appropriate to our circumstances. We continue toadhere to the concept of the extended family  for example and many of the principles that are inherent in that systemhave long ensured a respect in our society for basic humanrights.Changing times  however  inevitably challenge oldtraditions  and the maintenance of our traditional humanrights standards becomes a process of adaptation to ourincreasingly mobile and homogeneous society  in whichlegal and governmental institutions must now also play acentral role. Here we stand to benefit by involvement andparticipation in the international human rights movement as was pointed out by our Vice-President in his address tothe World Conference in Vienna several years ago.As we have studied the mechanisms and obligations ofthe various United Nations Treaties on human rights  wehave entered into constructive internal debates. Children  forexample  are among our most important treasures  and sowe first acceded to the Convention on the Rights of theChild. The preparation of our first report to that Conventionwas a thought-provoking exercise. Traditionally  women inisland cultures have been treated with love and respect  buthave not participated fully in public affairs. This isbeginning to change. We recently sent a strong delegationto the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing  andare actively considering accession to the Convention on theElimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women.Overall  we realize that our own application of humanrights standards must evolve progressively along with oursociety.The Federated States of Micronesia also accepts theresponsibility of continuing to speak out  along withsimilarly committed States  on the need to challenge thoseGovernments that still refuse to accord their own citizensthe fundamental rights of human beings. It is a long andoften discouraging process  but only with a strong  constant collective voice can the international community maintainthe progress being made in exposing and deterring abusesby the powerful against the unempowered.Much attention has been drawn in the past severalyears to the serious financial condition of the UnitedNations and the need to reform and restructure it. SomeMembers are so disheartened by the slow pace of this effortthat they have lost their resolve to maintain their ownfinancial commitments to the United Nations  making theproblems worse and threatening the continued ability ofthis Organization to carry out its work.It is the view of the Federated States of Micronesiathat while there may be inequities in the structure ofassessments  Member States should address them whilecontinuing to meet existing commitments that wereestablished pursuant to agreed procedures. There willalways be some level of disagreement over structures andthe requirements of funding. But it would be a tragedy ofhistoric proportions if the pursuit of the goals of theCharter were substantially hindered by Member Statesthat feel that they can rightfully tailor their contributionsto their own satisfaction according to how their particulardemands are met. The fact is that  when we give dueregard to the importance of our overall work here  thisOrganization  even without reform  is well worth itscost — especially when one considers the sums spent bynations on activities that do not contribute to internationalpeace and development.There is no doubt that  as we begin the next halfcentury of work  the capacity of this Organization ischallenged by issues that seem to grow rapidly in numberand complexity. But this is not a sign of failure  nor of alack of capacity. Neither does it suggest that we needanother instrument. It is  rather  an indication of theincreasing interconnectedness of the global communityand of the growing inclination among nations to find andrecognize their common interests and to work together toadvance those interests.In order to maintain and improve the responsivenessof the United Nations in a world in which it facesincreasing demands  it is necessary that  on a continuingbasis  we apply effective upgrades to the way we do ourwork here. Only in this way can we keep theOrganization on a positive course  and faithfully translatethe mandates of the Charter into terms of continuingrelevance. This is the real meaning of reform. It is not aconsequence of past inadequacy  but a positiveevolutionary development.That is easily said  but as we all know  it is verydifficult to put into practice. Even so we must not allowthat high degree of difficulty to plunge us into frustrationand defeat. The great achievements of those who havebeen here before us over the last 50 years must behonoured by our unshakable determination to take theUnited Nations into the next millennium as the singlemost effective multilateral instrument for the bettermentof mankind.7I believe that this Assembly can and will accomplishmuch to add to the list of tangible achievements both forthe direct benefit of the peoples of the world and for theimprovement of this Organization itself. We have thehistory  the vision and the leadership. Moreover  theurgency is clearly seen by us all. Let us resolve to applyourselves as never before  and to live up to the greatpotential that resides in this Hall."
"59",2491,"GAB",51,1996,"﻿On behalf of the Government of Gabon  it is an honour anda pleasure for me to address this eminent gathering.Like previous speakers  I wish to recall that thismeeting is being held just one year after thecommemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the UnitedNations. On that occasion  the balance sheet of ouractivities was examined many times. Fortunately  we are allagreed that we must seek together to find solutions to themajor problems of the world  thereby preventing theoutbreak of conflicts by establishing effective tools fornegotiation and cooperation.For all of us who participate and who believe in it  theUnited Nations is a valuable tool in the service of acommon ideal. This has been reflected in some positiveachievements achieved through pragmatism. The essentiallesson to draw from our assessments is that  while it hasnot yet been able to meet all the challenges before it  theUnited Nations has nonetheless remained worthy of ourhopes.That is why delegations from nearly all nationsannually take the opportunity offered by the regular sessionof the General Assembly to review the major concerns ofthe moment and to devise new goals.But before touching on that subject  I wish to conveyto Mr. Razali the sincere and warm congratulations of thedelegation of Gabon on his brilliant election to thepresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-first session.It is a tribute to his country  Malaysia  and a recognition ofhis great personal qualities. He has our best wishes forsuccess as he guides our proceedings.I would also like to express our thanks and affectionto his predecessor  Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral  Ministerof Foreign Affairs of Portugal  for the manner in which hecarried out his term of office at the fiftieth session.To Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali  Ireaffirm here the support of the Government of Gabon forall his work on the tasks of our Organization and for thecompetence and authority he has demonstrated in carryingout his mandate  which have coincided with the formulationof United Nations reform measures. He is a worthy son ofAfrica who has done honour to our Organization. As allmember States of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)stated at the July 1996 Summit in Yaoundé  Gabon hopesthat he will continue his work.Building lasting and orderly peace based on thesincere and active cooperation of sovereign nations is oneof the major missions of the United Nations. In ourinterdependent yet fragmented and multipolar world  theUnited Nations must play a more assertive role particularly in the emergence of a new political andeconomic international order. It must help us to redressthe general imbalance that has gripped the world since theend of the 1980s.The sovereign equality of all States is among themain principles of our community of nations.Accordingly  we must cultivate flexible and dynamicthought that transcends relations of power and allows ourOrganization to achieve its goal of universality. This isthe approach one must follow with regard to UnitedNations reform. Many countries have made contributionsand many initiatives have been taken  as can be seen inthe reports of the working groups established for thatpurpose. Gabon is gratified.On the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations El Hadj Omar Bongo  President of the GaboneseRepublic  stated:“The Security Council ... should be reformed inorder to embrace the present dimensions of ourOrganization”. (Official Records of the GeneralAssembly  Fiftieth Session  Plenary Meetings  36thmeeting  p. 15)Restructuring the United Nations  we believe  shouldalso include sweeping reform of its various subsidiarybodies  with a view to avoiding duplication in itsfunctioning and programmes.To sum up Gabon’s position  we would like to saythree things. First  it seems desirable and possible that thepermanent membership of the Security Council could beincreased without that body’s becoming unwieldy.Secondly  and on this assumption  Africa should at leasthave one permanent seat. Thirdly  that permanent seatshould be rotated among all African countries accordingto modalities to be defined later.The complexity of this reform and its many political economic and financial implications should not prevent usfrom laying out the configuration of international relationsin the twenty-first century. Since a considerable numberof Security Council decisions affect Africa  that regionmust not remain unrepresented on the Council  a body ofparamount importance for the maintenance of22international peace and security. In the context of reform Gabon subscribes to the objectives of rationalization and theclustering of activities whenever this enhances theeffectiveness of the work of the United Nations.We must attach priority importance to theestablishment of a reformed international system that canpreserve the world from murderous conflicts that disrupt theeconomies of the warring countries — a system that canfight underdevelopment  preserve the environment and wagea worldwide combat against pandemics such as AIDS andmalaria — in other words  an international system that canbreak down the barriers to harmony and development in arichly diverse world. It is certainly a daunting task  but onlythrough these efforts and under these conditions can ourOrganization secure lasting peace in the world.Also high on the agenda is the resolution of problemsrelating to development and to social progress in a climateof peace  with full respect for fundamental human rights.Throughout the years differences of opinion have arisenwith respect to these issues — particularly on how toresolve them. But given their decisive importance for ourfuture and that of the United Nations  the internationalcommunity must mobilize to act on them.More generally speaking  the time has come for us towork together to restore to the United Nations its politicaldynamism and the means it still lacks. Clearly  then  wehave a great deal to think about.I should like now to touch on some matters ofconcern  such as peace and development — values andhopes that are shared by all.Dialogue is a prerequisite for — though not aguarantee of — achieving peace  which is indispensable forhuman society to develop and flourish. I refer not only tothe civilized dialogue of diplomatic relations — which  ofcourse  is essential  but rather to a dialogue that could giverise to a culture — the culture of peace. Indeed  wheneverything is based on violence  dialogue is impossible. AsBoris Pasternak wrote  “One cannot win others over byviolence”.The Bantu people value dialogue. On the occasion ofthe fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations  the Presidentof Gabon  from this very rostrum  stated:“I wish to propose that a real dialogue  apermanent dialogue  be established  under the auspicesof the United Nations  between Heads of State andGovernment of the South and those of the North. Inthat way  we may be able to find solutions to ourcommon problems.” (Official Records of the GeneralAssembly  Fiftieth Session  Plenary Meetings  36thmeeting  p. 16)If each State were to refrain from attempting toimpose its views on others  whatever the cost  and agreedthat meeting the needs of peoples in a diverse andinterdependent world requires dialogue and solidarity then lasting peace and development can be achieved. Thatis why we must usher in a new era  the era ofdialogue — genuine  honest and constructive dialogue.We must continue to work together on an equalfooting  with respect for humankind’s interests and values.We must denounce and put an end to political violence economic marginalization and social injustice. Dialoguemust begin again: in Africa  in the Great Lakes region  inLiberia and Somalia; but also in the Middle East  in theformer Yugoslavia  in Cyprus and in Chechnya —wherever it may be necessary.Gabon is contributing  and will always contribute  tobuilding the vast edifice of peace. Our duty  indeed ourinterest — in keeping with the letter and the spirit of theCharter of the United Nations — lies in undertaking thistask. History has taught us that no country can hope toremain an island of peace in a sea of poverty  tension andwar.I believe that it is imperative to enhance themodalities of action available to the United Nations in thefield of preventive diplomacy. In this connection  we mustexplore further proposals to equip the Secretariat with anEarly Warning System aimed at preventing conflicts fromerupting.Our faith in dialogue and our relentless pursuit ofpeace are the reasons why Gabon  whenever asked  hasalways agreed to engage in mediation to resolve domesticconflicts in neighbouring countries  with the particulargoal of paving the way for a lasting peace.In January 1996 Gabon hosted a round table aimedat inter-Chadian reconciliation. In March 1996 we alsoenabled our Angolan brothers to strengthen thefoundations for their future understanding  in the presenceof several international observers. In both cases  the goalwas to settle differences and clear up misunderstandings.What was important for Gabon and its President was tobreak through the wall of mistrust that barred the way to23reaching sincere and lasting agreements on solutions to suchcrises.We cannot claim victory. The peace process in mostcountries is lengthy  and reversals  which can delay orjeopardize its conclusion  are frequent. For this reason  theinternational community must encourage and support thosebrothers at war who have opted for the path of dialogue tobuild peace. It must also promote goodwill  which willenable the warring parties to resolve their conflicts. Africaprovides numerous examples of this.The peace we seek requires not only dialogue but alsoother  sound initiatives such as disarmament anddenuclearization. In this connection  we welcome theindefinite extension last year of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Likewise  we are proudof the fact that in March 1996  the African countries signedin Cairo the Pelindaba Text of the African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty on the denuclearization of ourcontinent. Finally  we warmly welcome the GeneralAssembly’s adoption  on 10 September 1996  of theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. I signed ityesterday on behalf of my country.The Central African States have decided to harmonizetheir policies on conventional disarmament  with a view toestablishing a register of conventional arms. The success ofthis subregional undertaking will depend not only on thewill of the States of the subregion  but also on the politicalsupport and assistance of all States Members of the UnitedNations.Peace is also the result of confidence-buildingmeasures. The adoption of binding legal instruments andthe effective use of preventive diplomacy will allow Africato be exorcised of the spectre of death-dealing conflicts.The United Nations Standing Advisory Committee onSecurity Questions in Central Africa is working towardsthat end. It just passed an important test with the solemnsignature  on 8 July 1996  of a non-aggression pact duringthe thirty-second ordinary session of the Assembly ofHeads of State and Government of the Organization ofAfrican Unity (OAU). This important preventive diplomacymeasure shows that the Governments of the Central Africancountries intend to give pride of place to dialogue in thepeaceful settlement of disputes among them.The signing of this pact by the Heads of State of thesubregion proves the importance and priority that thecountries of Central Africa accord to the Standing AdvisoryCommittee on Security Questions in Central Africa. TheGovernment of Gabon thanks the General Assembly forsupporting that machinery through a trust fund  whichgenerous donors  such as Japan  are beginning to pay into.In 1974  during the special session of the UnitedNations General Assembly  President Bongo  using anexample from nature  and according to a Gabonesemaxim  stated that:“When all the animals have been fed  calm reignsover the plains. (...) When the peoples of the earthhave the vital minimum and maximum of dignity towhich they are entitled  peace and harmony willfinally have some likelihood of reigning on earth.”(Official Records of the General Assembly  sixthspecial session of the General Assembly  2210thPlenary Meeting  para. 30)Development is certainly essential to peace. I wouldeven go as far as to say that it is an intrinsic element ofpeace.Although Africa has been wrestling with seriouseconomic  social and political problems for over twodecades  it is safe to say that henceforth it will vigorouslyand courageously undertake the reforms needed for itsrecovery.However  African countries can make progress inthis direction only if they are given adequate support bythe international community  and by the developedcountries in particular.The goals of sustained economic growth  socialdevelopment  environmental protection and respect forhuman rights and fundamental freedoms set in the plansof action of several international conferences havesustainable development as their common denominator.We are witnessing an era of radical changecomparable to the Industrial Revolution of the nineteenthcentury. The globalization of the economy and ofinformation and communications is changing relationsamong nations and increasing interdependence.While these trends inspire great hope  they also raisenumerous concerns because the impact of globalizationvaries from country to country. Those in Africa  inparticular  where most come under the category of leastdeveloped countries  are facing a worrisome economicsituation. Despite declarations and programmes of action resources are not forthcoming.24International economic and financial relations arechanging radically and quickly  as is clear from the eventsof recent years. The establishment of the InternationalSeabed Authority which is well under way and which wewelcome; the creation of the World Trade Organization in1995  which is accelerating the easing of restrictions on freetrade and its globalization; and the gradual establishment oflarge regional blocs in various parts of the world are allfeatures of the new international order.This situation  which is conducive to the emergence orconsolidation of poles of integration  is far  on every score from benefitting African States  whose income  whichderives essentially from basic commodities  remainsvulnerable to price fluctuations on the international marketthat are out of their control.In addition  our continent’s heavy debt burden meansthat our region is responsible for the greatest volume ofreverse financial transfers due to debt repayment.Structural adjustment programmes  although beneficial mean that populations have to make enormous sacrifices.These programmes are now being followed in countriesundergoing political reorganization. Because of the waydemocracy works  it is assumed that citizens support theproposed programmes. Inevitably  this increases thedemands made by society. For Governments  it is trulydifficult to find a balance between these contradictoryrequirements.Of course  to remain credible partners we must abideby the requirements that go along with structural adjustmentand the recovery of our economies. But we are duty-boundto include social needs when formulating and implementingreforms. The adoption of measures to promote sustainedeconomic growth should not distract us from financingbasic social and economic infrastructures such as roads schools  hospitals  vocational training centres and so on.This financing is essential if we are to improve ourpopulations’ living conditions and quality of life. Asrepresentatives know  the United Nations remains sensitiveto this approach. Encouragement is needed  however  toensure that this feeling is shared by its various agencies.Governments have been called on to include poverty-eradication strategies in general  people-orienteddevelopment policies. How do we do this?In establishing a favourable economic environment the international community must support the efforts of allcountries that are willing to take this course of action. As1996 marks the beginning of the United Nations Decadefor the Eradication of Poverty  common objectives andthe commitments entered into in the framework ofoverseas development assistance must now becomereality.However  since 1991  this assistance has declined inreal terms. Private capital flows have been exclusivelyfocused in some 20 developing countries. So far  therehas been no upsurge in private investment in countries ofthe African Financial Community (CFA)  despite theconsiderable devaluation of the CFA franc in January1994.We hope that the United Nations System-wideSpecial Initiative on Africa recently launched by theSecretary-General will ensure that the United Nationssystem as a whole  including the World Bank and theInternational Monetary Fund  will help to mobilize theinternational community. Likewise  the internationalcommunity must look into the crucial issue of debt because it is jeopardizing the development of ourcountries.My country believes that new solutions to deal withdebt  its conversion or refashioning in the interests ofeconomic and social development are essential to alleviateits heavy burden and to make it compatible withdevelopment  in the spirit of consensus prompted by theVienna Declaration and Programme of Action.We reject and label as unjust any discrimination orclassification between developing countries  as thisusually makes Gabon ineligible for much of the assistanceit requires for its development.African peoples and Governments are not sitting idlyby  waiting for assistance from the internationalcommunity. They are tirelessly making tremendous effortsto overcome the crisis they face. I am pleased to mentionin this respect the positive role that the Organization ofAfrican Unity is playing in backing our efforts.OAU  in submitting the Treaty Establishing theAfrican Economic Community in June 1991 in Abuja toour Heads of State and Government for signature understood that in the new international scenario multilateral relations supersede bilateral relations.The Abuja Agreement entered into force in May1994  and the first ministerial session of its Economic and25Social Commission will be held next November in Abidjan.Subregional economic communities are becoming strongerall the time. Outside institutional frameworks  theseeconomic blocs are implementing common programmes oncurrency  payment methods  business law  the developmentof scientific and technological capacity  energy resources the environment and so on.In the Central Africa subregion  our countries areinvolved also in subregional integration  which they see asa major component of development policy.It was in this spirit that the thirtieth summit of theCentral African Customs and Economic Union wasconvened in Yaoundé  Cameroon  from 20 to 22December 1994. The entry into force of customs reformon 1 July 1995 and the signing in July 1996 in Librevilleof a text that establishes the Central African Economicand Monetary Community are designed to coordinate andstrengthen the various regional integration efforts.These are the main ideas that Gabon wishes  throughme  to contribute to our consideration of the majorconcerns facing the international community today.Indeed  some of these questions are far from beingresolved. We hope that discussion of these issues willcontinue  without getting bogged down and with theparticipation of all  in order to find solutions that canprovide equitable and comprehensive guarantees for theinterests of all of our countries. These interests are basically  participation in forging a future for the UnitedNations; the maintenance and consolidation of peace;progress; and economic development.Members may have noticed that I have dwelt oneconomic development concerns. I have done so notbecause I am biased  but because we in Gabon believethat true peace cannot exist amid poverty and destruction.As the Romans said  “Si vis pacem  para bellum” — “Ifyou desire peace  prepare for war”.Today  on the threshold of the twenty-first century and in both domestic and international contexts  weshould say instead  “If you desire peace  prepare fordevelopment”  because development and economicprogress has truly become the face of peace."
"60",2538,"GBR",51,1996,"﻿May I begin bycongratulating Ambassador Razali of Malaysia on hisassumption of office as our General Assembly’s newPresident and offer our thanks to his predecessor Ambassador Freitas do Amaral  for all his valuable workduring the fiftieth session.The late twentieth century is an exciting time. For thefortunate among us  the world has never offered more:travel with unheard-of ease  a tantalizing cornucopia ofconsumer goods  100 or more television stations in ourhomes  the Internet. But these fruits are denied the vastmajority of the planet’s population. The number of peoplewho live in absolute poverty is still growing. Their miseryis a challenge to all our consciences  and I want today totalk about what we all  the developed countries as well asthe developing  can do for those trapped in poverty — whatwe can do together to open the door to development.But first of all I would like to say a few brief wordsabout four other issues of particular importance at thismoment in time.First of all  Hong Kong. The year 1997 will be aspecial one for Hong Kong. Less than 300 days from nowthe world will witness history. The peaceful transfer ofsovereignty over a territory of 6 million free and prosperouspeople is an event unparalleled in modern times. A transferon the basis of an international Treaty  registered here atthe United Nations — a Treaty between two members ofthe Security Council  which guarantees that for 50 yearsafter 1997 there will be “one country  two systems” andthat “Hong Kong people will rule Hong Kong”. Let therebe no doubt of Britain’s continuing commitment to thefuture of Hong Kong and its people  well into the nextcentury.Thanks to the efforts of the Hong Kong peoplethemselves  the development of Hong Kong is one of theworld’s great success stories. The Chinese Governmenthas made clear its determination to preserve Hong Kong’sprosperity  its stability and its way of life as a free andopen society based on the rule of law. For Britain  asuccessful transfer will be the closing of a chapter  butalso a new beginning to our relations with both HongKong and with China.I suggest that all Members of the United Nationshave a stake in this historic exercise. As long as thepromises of the joint Declaration are turned into reality Hong Kong has a bright future  as part of China and asone of the world’s leading cities  contributing enormouslyto growth and prosperity throughout the Asia-Pacificregion. And I am sure that all here will join me inwelcoming that prospect.I want also to take this opportunity to commend theInternational Court of Justice in its fiftieth anniversaryyear. The International Court has performedgroundbreaking work in settling disputes between States and I am proud that the United Kingdom has always beenamong the States that accept its compulsory jurisdiction.I hope that others will join us in pledging both moral andmaterial support to the International Court. The more whoaccept that international law must be the foundation ofinternational relations  the safer we shall all be.The world is safer today too with the historicsignature of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.Earlier this morning I had the privilege of signing theTreaty for the United Kingdom. It shows that we can  byacting with determination and by making sacrifices  reapthe benefits of the end of the cold war  and I firmlybelieve that the Treaty can make an importantcontribution to preventing the proliferation of nuclearweapons and in promoting international security. TheTreaty was the product of a multilateral negotiation andwas adopted here in the General Assembly. But that aloneis not enough. If it is to be fully effective  it mustcommand universal support  and the United Kingdom willnow put in hand the steps to allow us to ratify the Treaty.17It is the sovereign right of every State to decide whether ornot to be bound by international agreements. But it is ourfirm conviction that this Treaty is in the interests of all  andI urge all States to give it their full support.Meanwhile  other threats still loom large. Theinsidious spectre of terrorism is a concern to all of us here and it is right that the United Nations should be the forumfor debate on this worldwide menace. The United Kingdomis proposing for adoption at this session a United Nationsdeclaration which will spell out unequivocally that acts ofterrorism  and the financing  planning and incitement ofthese acts  are contrary to the purposes and principles of theUnited Nations. People who do these evil things and whoseek asylum under the United Nations refugee Conventiondo not deserve to benefit from it.The United Nations faces a critical year. It remains thehope of people across the world in search of peace anddevelopment. But the changes required to adapt andstrengthen the United Nations to meet the challenges of thefuture have not yet been completed. This year must see asolution to the financial crisis. Reform must be part of thesolution  including a thorough updating of the system ofassessing contributions to the United Nations  so thatcontributions match real ability to pay. But all Membersmust pay what they owe  both their assessments and theirarrears  and promptly; and the European Union’s proposalsare a good basis for negotiation. It will also be important toachieve over the coming year a resolution to the long-standing discussions of Security Council enlargement. Inshort  the United Nations must be made fit for the newmillennium.I turn now to my main theme. Three months ago  atLyons  the Group of Seven countries committed themselvesto a partnership for the economic development of the world.This is not just a catchy slogan; it is a fresh approach to thechallenge of development  and what it means is that thedeveloping countries and the developed together wouldshare responsibility for creating the conditions that willallow economies to grow  a shared agenda of measures thatwe need to take to promote development.For the countries of the developing world  this meanspursuing policies to enable economies to grow: taxes needto be kept low  subsidies cannot be allowed to distortmarkets  exports should not be impeded by heavy tariffs.Domestic markets must be allowed to operate with as littleinterference as possible. The goal must be to establish anenvironment where the private sector can flourish  for theprivate sector is the engine of growth.In 1755  Adam Smith famously remarked that forprosperity“Little else is requisite ... but peace  easy taxes  andtolerable administration of justice”.This is still a valid recipe today — not easy to achieve but with the sound foundations of good government andsensible macroeconomic policies  enterprise can flourishanywhere. This is the challenge to the Governments ofthe developing world.What of the developed world’s side of thebargain? — countries such as my own. Our responsibilityis to remove the shackles which hinder developingeconomies as they try to enter the global market. Many ofthe poorest countries are still caught in a mire of debtthey are unlikely ever to be able to pay off. This benefitsno one. The United Kingdom has long argued that  whencombined with macroeconomic reform of the kind I havedescribed  deep debt relief can kick-start the developmentof the poorest economies. Some time ago  Britain helpedto identify steps that could be taken to lift the debt burdenfrom the poorest  most indebted countries: more debtrelief from bilateral creditors and getting the multilateralagencies themselves to share more of the burden. Sincethen the Paris Club of creditors has made an importantcontribution by increasing debt forgiveness as agreedfollowing British proposals at the Naples Summit in 1994.The multilateral agencies too have come up with someuseful proposals  such as the World Bank’s Trust Fund toprovide debt relief. I also welcome the InternationalMonetary Fund’s (IMF) commitment to continueproviding concessional finance through the enhancedstructural adjustment facility.These measures to relieve debt need to beimplemented both flexibly and soon. The countries ingreatest need should be granted maximum relief as swiftlyas possible. I look forward to final agreement at theannual meetings of the IMF and the World Bank nextweek.The private sector is the motor of development.Private investment flows to the developing world are nowat record levels. The United Kingdom is the third largestsource of private investment. But these flows are still notreaching the poorest countries. There is therefore acontinuing need for concessional aid to prime the pumpof homegrown development. We need to focus our effortson those countries where help is needed most and whichcan make the best use of it. Help must primarily be18targeted at creating growth with equity  at developinghuman resources to their full potential  at giving priority tothe needs of the poor: to health and education  to cleanwater and small enterprises.Increasingly this partnership in development amongstus all has to deal with the growing problems of planetsurvival: climate change  the environment  the future of theworld’s oceans and forests  and pandemic diseases.Development which ignores these will not be sustainable.The United Nations is a central forum for focusing theattention and action of Governments and civil society onthese challenges as we enter the next century. Next year’sGeneral Assembly special session to review the Rio summiton environment and development is one example.But the best help that we in the developed world cangive to the developing is to buy what they produce  and todo that we in the developed world must demolish thebarriers that we still maintain against imports from thepoorer countries of the developing world. When I lookaround the world  I see many developing countries burstingwith exports that they have to sell: textiles  food manufactured goods. But tragically  the markets of thericher countries of the developed world are often closed tothese exports. Last week’s report from the United NationsConference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)predicted that poor countries could triple their exports to theNorth over the next 10 years if import quotas were phasedout — an extra $175 billion a year in income.Protectionism is starving the developing economies of theiroxygen  the oxygen of growth.The European Union’s record is better than most. Wealready have a wide-ranging scheme to allow duty-freeimports from developing countries. But even so  theEuropean Union obstructs  for example  imports ofPalestinian cut flowers; it obstructs fruit juices from SouthAfrica  strawberry jam from Bulgaria. Other developedcountries are even less generous. The United States targetsimports of Mexican tomatoes; Japan restricts imports of ricefrom South-East Asia. The list could go on.We all know the difficulty of resisting powerfuldomestic lobbies. They exist in Britain as elsewhere. Butthis sort of protectionism is not simply selfish; it is alsoshort-sighted. Growth and prosperity in the developingworld will over time increase  not diminish  the wealth ofthe industrialized world. Trade is not a zero-sum game. Itis a process which is mutually beneficial  mutuallyenriching; and with prosperity comes stability and greatersecurity for us all.This is not some fashionable nostrum dreamt up inan ivory tower. It is a prescription which has already beenseen to work. Since 1945  under the auspices of theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)  theworld economy has moved steadily towards more openmarkets. And the result is clear: five decades ofunprecedented economic growth and prosperity. It isincumbent upon us to spread this benefit more widely.That is why I so warmly welcome the proposal putforward by the Director-General of the World TradeOrganization. Mr. Ruggiero has proposed that the least-developed countries be granted tariff-free access to themarkets of the developed world. I wholeheartedlywelcome this initiative. I hope that others will see itscompelling logic: the best hope the poor have forsustained economic development is to be given thefreedom to export  the freedom to sell.That freedom enables countries to grow. But freetrade is not just helpful to developing countries  it is aglobal good  its benefits are spread wide  to the producersand consumers in the developed and the developing worldalike  who can profit from the greater efficiency that freetrade engenders  and who can buy the best and cheapestproducts available on the world markets. In short  freetrade benefits us all. That is why Britain is so firmlycommitted to bringing the vision of global free trade toreality by the year 2020.Free trade begins at home. Cutting tariffs and otherimport restrictions helps developing countries by cuttingthe costs of production  boosting efficiency and thushelping exports and growth. Combine these benefits withthe freedom to export granted by open markets in thedeveloped world  and developing countries and theireconomies can enjoy a virtuous circle of development.Free trade is therefore the catalyst for growth. This is notjust good economic theory. Greater efficiency and highergrowth mean more resources available for new hospitalsand new schools  better housing and cleaner water. Freetrade means real benefits for poor people.I have described today a challenge for every one ofus here. Poverty is something we can all do somethingabout. In May  the Organisation for EconomicCooperation and Development proposed that thedeveloped and developing worlds together should try tocut the number of people living in absolute poverty byhalf by 2015. Britain commits itself to that goal. It isachievable.19At home  we must liberalize our economies  minimizethe burden of government and lift all restrictions on the freeoperation of the market. In the global economy  we mustremove barriers to trade to allow the developing countriesto sell. We must help lift the millstone of debt from thosewho can least bear it. We cannot allow the poorestmembers of the world community to become marginalized.We must do our utmost to enable all Members of theUnited Nations to enjoy the fruits of integration into theglobal economy. A revitalized United Nations has anessential part to play.I do not underestimate the difficulty of the tasks thatI have described. We can only confront them in partnership rich and poor together. If we all play our part  prosperitycan be placed within the grasp of even the poorestcountries."
"61",2562,"GEO",51,1996,"﻿Allow me at the outset to warmly congratulatethe President on his election to his post at the fifty-firstsession of the General Assembly. I am deeply honouredto speak from this rostrum for the first time  and wouldlike to take this opportunity to thank all our friends in theworld community for the valuable assistance given to usin the construction of a new  democratic Georgia.In recent years  Georgia has undergone everypossible trial in the transition from the old and obsoleteto the new and progressive. Overcoming the totalitarianpast has been very painful  demanding many sacrifices. Inconditions of post-communist chaos  ongoing ethno-political conflicts and a precipitous decline in theeconomy  Georgia has managed  with the help of theinternational community  to stabilize the situation. Overthe past two years  democratic institutions have beenestablished  economic stability has been achieved  anational currency has been introduced  the process ofprivatization is being completed and favourable conditionsfor foreign investment are being created. The presidentialand parliamentary elections held last year confirmed thestrong determination of the Georgian people to continueon the path of democratic development. All this has beendone in order to further the gradual integration ofGeorgia  and indeed the whole of Transcaucasia  into theinternational economic system. Georgia has had toovercome a number of obstacles on this course  bothsubjective and objective in nature.Today I would like to draw the Assembly’s attentionto the phenomenon that has become the main obstacle inGeorgia’s path to recovery: aggressive separatism  whichcan completely nullify the beginnings of peace andstability not only in Georgia  but in the entire region.Aggressive separatism is not a new phenomenon  but ithas only recently come to the attention of the world15community  due to its global nature and its destructiveimpact on international security. I can say with certaintythat the world community has no right to take the positionof an outside observer on this question  because countriesand entire regions are subjected to separatism  regardless oftheir geographic location and level of development.Despite differences in the underlying reasons for theemergence of separatist movements  in their nature and intheir scale they have one thing in common: they establishregimes on the ideological basis of terrorism under thebanner of “the self-determination of suppressed people”.We are certain that everyone present in this Hall considersthe principle of self-determination for nations and peoplesone of the most important basic principles of internationallaw. Contemporary international law has established a clearframework for the implementation of this principle. Yet itis unacceptable for the principle of self-determination to beexploited by national minorities or small nations that havehistorically constituted a single society with other nations within the framework of sovereign States that today areMembers of the United Nations.There is good reason for us to have singled out theproblem of aggressive separatism  as we consider it to bethe main threat to international peace and security at thisstage. Georgia has made enormous efforts to introduce thenotion of aggressive separatism into the agenda of theworld. Aggressive separatism uses “ethnic cleansing” as themain tool of vengeance against other nations and ethnicgroups.Here I must bring up the example of Abkhazia:300 000 peaceful Georgian citizens have been expelledfrom the territory of Abkhazia. Thousands more have beenshot  burned  hanged or tortured to death. Furthermore  thepersecution of the Georgian population on the basis ofethnic origin was raised by the separatist regime to thelevel of state policy. This is a most serious crime againsthumanity.Analogous manifestations of aggressive separatism aretaking place in other parts of the world. Consequently  thestream of refugees increases constantly  and this process hasacquired the form of a powerful new global factor fraughtwith unpredictable social and economic consequences. Webelieve we need more fully developed measures in order tooppose it effectively.What can we do about this? As a rule  the response ofthe world community to separatism as a phenomenon isnearly always late and consequently inadequate to existingconditions.The first resolution of the Security Council on theconflict in Abkhazia was adopted on 9 July 1993; themost recent  on 12 July 1996. Comparing them  we cansee that it took three years to call something by its propername: to call an aggressor an aggressor  a criminal acriminal and a victim a victim.It is obvious that we need a doctrine to containaggressive separatism. This should include a number ofmeasures directed at revealing the underlying causes andat preventing and overcoming any manifestation ofextremist separatist tendencies.We consider it necessary  first  to define thephenomenon of separatism in terms of international lawand  to that end  to establish a corresponding juridical andlegal basis  namely  a well-defined system to identify andcategorize aggressive separatism in international legaldocuments.Secondly  it is necessary to introduce and enforceeconomic measures. One might respond that the practicalimplementation of economic sanctions already exists.However  these should be binding in nature and theirenforcement fall under the strict control of theinternational community; moreover  there must be follow-up implementation of sanctions against violators  ifnecessary. At the same time  in order to eliminateeconomic incentives for armed hostilities  we shouldprovide economic assistance and other means of supportto regions where separatist tendencies are growing instrength.Thirdly  we must consider measures of a military-political character  such as the imposition of armsembargoes against those regions where separatism takeson aggressive forms.Fourthly  those who have committed these crimesagainst humanity must be fully aware that they cannotavoid severe punishment and that  sooner or later  theywill have to stand before an international tribunal. It isclear that international terrorism and aggressiveseparatism are interconnected and that we must combineour efforts in the struggle against both.The efforts of the countries of the Group of 8 aimedat the elimination of international terrorism give us causefor hope. The Government of Georgia fully supports the16recent initiative of the President of Egypt to establish a newspecialized international organization dedicated to thestruggle against these evils. We must also work as speedilyas possible on the creation of a stable system of regionalsecurity  without which the process of aggressive separatismthat has contributed to the political and economicdisintegration of traditional regional structures of mutuallybeneficial cooperation and ethno-cultural exchanges willonly grow  hastening the division of regions into hostilemicrosystems under the permanent influence ofneighbouring regional Powers.Once again  let us focus concretely on the prospectsfor a peaceful settlement of the Abkhaz problem. Thecurrent negotiations continue under the auspices of theUnited Nations and through the mediation of the RussianFederation. The “Friends of Georgia” group of countries isalso making concerted efforts. The settlement of the conflicthas thus taken on an international scale.We have repeatedly declared Georgia’s position on thesettlement of this conflict and the determination ofAbkhazia’s status. First  it is necessary and very possible tosettle the conflict through a peaceful process of negotiation.Through the new Constitution of Georgia  adopted last year the question of the state territorial structure of our countrywas deliberately left open. At the same time  proposalswere elaborated according to which Abkhazia would begranted autonomy in accordance with the highest possibleinternational standards.Just over a month ago  the President of Georgia madea statement in which he once again set forth his suggestionsregarding the settlement of the conflict in the Caucasus including his assertion to the authorities in Sukhumi of hisreadiness to meet immediately for serious discussions.Unfortunately  these efforts have borne no fruit. Theresponsibility for that lies with the separatists. It has provenhitherto impossible to achieve progress towards a politicalsettlement. Moreover  the separatist regime  sensing itsimpunity  has undertaken a new series of provocations attempting to organize so-called parliamentary elections onthe same territory which was ethnically cleansed and onwhich less than one-fifth of the native population presentlyresides. The regime has cynically ignored the mediationefforts of the Russian Federation  the United Nations andthe world community  numerous resolutions of the SecurityCouncil and the decisions of various forums.The growing concern on this point is alsounderstandable. Has not the perfunctory evaluation of actsof “ethnic cleansing” and genocide in Abkhazia  byaccident or a design  strengthened the confidence of theseparatists that they will get away with their crimes andeven legitimize the status quo?In the recent past  Transcaucasia acted as a boundarybetween two opposing systems  two military-politicalblocs separated by the iron curtain and implacableideologies. These confrontational orientations did notallow the innate human and natural resources of theregion to be fully exploited  relegating it to a secondaryrole on the periphery of the world stage.As a consequence of historic changes that occurredbefore our very eyes  we believe that the time has comeseriously to reappraise the role of our region. Our finalaim is to turn it into the very opposite of what it oncewas. The Caucasus can become and is already becominga region of multilateral cooperation  not only between theStates geographically located within it. The prospects forcreating a transportation corridor across our region aregradually becoming reality. The States of Central Asia the Black Sea basin and Western and Eastern Europe aredirectly involved in the process of its creation. There hasthus been a logical growth in the internationalcommunity’s interest in the fate of the Caucasus.The Caucasus today is a complicated interlacing ofpolitical economic and financial contradictions andinterests. Therefore  it is necessary to respondappropriately to these emerging circumstances. Otherwise we run the risk of creating a new  powerful and large-scale breeding ground for international tensions.While pondering the creation of a new global and  inparticular  European infrastructure of stability  we have inmind very specific elements that will create a single andindivisible unit. In this context  the initiative of PresidentShevardnadze on a peaceful Caucasus  proposed in thespring of 1996  can serve as the basis for the creation ofa regional model that could  in its own right  become amajor component in a general and comprehensive modelof security for Europe in the next century. The ideas setforth in this initiative were discussed and approved inprinciple at the summit between the Presidents of theRussian Federation  Armenia  Azerbaijan and Georgia and the leaders of the northern Caucasus Republics withinthe Russian Federation in June 1996.These proposals are aimed not only at the peacefulsettlement of conflicts currently besetting the Caucasus but also at post-conflict settlement  insuring the security17and multi-level development of the region. They advocatethe application of generally recognized  fundamentalprinciples of international law  the observance of whichwould guarantee peace and stability in the region.I am not engaging in wishful thinking. The road toachieving all this will  of course  not be easy  but I amconfident that the States of the region possess sufficientdetermination and political will  together with the activeparticipation of the international community  to make theonly correct decision and  like one of Brecht’s characters break out of the “Caucasian Chalk Circle”.I would like to share some of my concerns on theprospects for new United Nations activities. The impendingreforms  supported by practically all Member States  testifyto a qualitatively new stage in the development ofinternational relations. At the same time  the need forreforms places great responsibility on us. We have no rightto take hasty decisions that might result in unforeseenconsequences. On the other hand  excessive dilatorinesscould also harm our cause.Given the new realities in international relations  it isclear that these changes should be reflected in the body ofthe United Nations that is entrusted with the primaryresponsibility for the maintenance of international peace andsecurity. ln order to enable the Security Council to respondadequately to contemporary challenges  new geopoliticalrealities should be reflected in its structure. I refer to thetimely question of increasing the number of permanent andnon-permanent members of the Council. We are fullyconvinced that increasing the number of members wouldexpand the geopolitical base of the Security Council  whichin turn would make it more effective and representative.In considering in this context the candidacy ofGermany and Japan for possible permanent membership  weare guided by the hope that we would finally andirrevocably have an opportunity to overcome thepsychological consequences of the Second World War andthe cold war. In 1992 our President argued  from thisrostrum  for the need to expand the membership of theSecurity Council by including Germany and Japan; andGeorgia has repeatedly advocated this since.Careful consideration should be given to proposals putforward by Italy and other Member States with regard tonon-permanent membership of the Security Council.However  the Security Council should remain acomparatively small body  which makes it more dynamic.Most importantly  in considering an increase in Councilmembership  due attention should be paid primarily to thedegree of participation of Member States in themaintenance of international peace and security.The changes should also touch upon the practicalside of Council activities  especially with regard toconflict resolution. The criteria that guide the SecurityCouncil in the use of its discretionary rights  provided forin Chapters VI  VII and VIII of the Charter  should bemore clearly formulated and universally applied.In order to improve the management ofpeacekeeping operations  the Secretary-General’s SpecialEnvoy should be responsible for coordinating theimplementation of peacekeeping operations  with thedirect participation of regional organizations. We shouldalso note that a significant number of conflicts throughoutthe world do not fall within the category of threats tointernational peace and security under Chapter VII of theCharter  although they are characterized by gross andmassive human rights violations and are considered to becrimes against humanity.Thus  in most cases  the initiators and executors ofthese crimes  which include “ethnic cleansing” andgenocide  feel that they enjoy impunity because of theinability of the international community to take legalaction. Consequently  we should consider theestablishment of a permanent United Nations specialinternational observer institution  which would investigatethe facts pertaining to such crimes.Georgia  having undergone the tragedy of conflict inAbkhazia  and having experienced “ethnic cleansing” andgenocide in its own population  is keenly interested in therapid establishment and effective functioning of aninternational criminal court. Such a body should becomean effective tool for implementing the law on behalf ofthe international community. We are inspired by the factthat the International Law Commission has alreadyapproved the text for a list of crimes against peace andhumanity.We are also happy that the United Nations hasalready taken steps in laying the foundation fordeveloping peacekeeping contingents of stand-by forces.Georgia has already declared its readiness for activeparticipation in the establishment of stand-by forces. Webelieve  however  that the United Nations should not takehalf measures  as the use of stand-by forces cannotcompletely resolve problems of effective and timely18reaction to conflict situations arising in different parts ofthe world.In this connection  we are convinced that we shouldfinally implement the idea of establishing a United Nationsrapid deployment force to carry out the tasks prescribed bythe Security Council to restrain the escalation of conflictsand deploy the main peacemaking contingents of the UnitedNations.In conclusion  we would like to see the worldcommunity as a union of free nations that enrich each otherspiritually  economically and culturally. Mutual efforts inthis direction will inevitably lead to the establishment of apermanent  cooperative peace in a world free of wars andethnic conflicts.The General Assembly offers a unique opportunity toelaborate a uniform and coordinated approach to the real global problems of humanity. This is our chance to reachglobal consensus  and we should take full advantage of it.I thank the Assembly for its attention  and express myhope that our pain and our hopes will be taken into accountby the entire international community."
"62",2609,"GHA",51,1996,"﻿My delegation wishes toexpress its satisfaction and joy in seeing Mr. RazaliIsmail preside over the fifty-first session of the GeneralAssembly. His unanimous election is an honour to himpersonally and also to his country  Malaysia  with whichGhana has forged very warm and special relations. Wehave no doubt that his sterling qualities and long recordof distinguished service to his Government and theinternational community will stand him in good stead inleading this Assembly to a successful conclusion of itswork.To his predecessor  Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral ofPortugal  we wish to express our appreciation for the ablemanner in which he led us through very difficultnegotiations during his presidency.Our Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali has demonstrated  through his indefatigable energy andcommitment to the independence and well-being of theUnited Nations  that he is up to the challenges that lieahead of us in seeking to revitalize this Organization forthe twenty-first century.It was only a year ago that we celebrated withfanfare the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of ourOrganization. The world leaders assembled in thisAssembly at that time once again rededicated themselvesto achieving the visions embodied in the Charter of ourOrganization and fulfilling its goals and objectives  whichserve the largest interests of humanity. We have gatheredhere again this year to take stock of developments sinceour last meeting and to renew  through various decisionsand resolutions  our commitment to the promotion ofpeace and prosperity for our mutual benefit.The end of the cold war provides us with a goldenopportunity to work earnestly in pursuit of theinternational community’s desire for general and completedisarmament — including nuclear disarmament — to beachieved under effective international control. Throughthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weaponsand nuclear-weapon-free zones  most of us non-nuclear-weapon States are making our contributions in thisrespect. My Government is in the process of ratifying thePelindaba Treaty  of which we are a proud signatory  andwe appreciate the support of the non-nuclear and nuclear-weapon States for that Treaty. However  such zones can20only be given meaning by the nuclear-weapon States’genuinely accepting the need for the eventual elimination ofnuclear weapons within a given time-frame. It is with thisin view that my country voted in favour of the adoption ofthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and signed it despite its shortcomings. We see the Treaty as a first stepin the eventual elimination of nuclear weapons in the world.We also join the Non-Aligned Movement in urging allnuclear-weapon States to conclude an internationalinstrument that would offer unconditional and legallybinding assurances to all non-nuclear-weapon States againstthe use or threat of use of nuclear weapons. This willenable all States subscribing to international instruments onnon-proliferation to cooperate freely and unconditionally inthe application of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes.We will also continue to urge that more attention bepaid to conventional armaments and to efforts to enhanceinternational cooperation to curtail and eventually prohibitthe use of anti-personnel land-mines and other inhumaneweapons  which continue to inflict untold damage andhardship on innocent people long after the conflicts inwhich they were deployed have ended. Similar attentionshould be given to international cooperation in curbingillicit transfers of arms. Success in this field will go a longway towards curtailing the availability of weapons  whichfeed the numerous conflicts we have had to contend with inrecent years  to drug traffickers and terrorists.Internal strife within States  nurtured by racial andreligious intolerance  and the resort to arms for thesettlement of disputes threaten the very existence of anumber of States in diverse regions of the world. In all ofthese States  the intransigence of warlords poses seriouschallenges to the capacity of the international community ingeneral and the United Nations in particular to meet theirresponsibilities with regard to the maintenance ofinternational peace and security. We have seen this in theformer Yugoslavia  Afghanistan  Somalia  Rwanda Burundi  Angola  Liberia and Haiti. The efforts made so farto deal with these conflicts are laudable  but more needs tobe done.That is what we are doing in West Africa  despite therecent setbacks suffered from the attacks on forces of theEconomic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) in December 1995 and theoutbreak of fighting in Monrovia in April and May 1996.Though the implementation of the programme for thedisarmament and demobilization of the fighters  theirreinsertion into normal civil life and the holding ofdemocratic elections in Liberia  as set out in the AbujaAgreement  are now behind schedule  the meeting of theECOWAS Committee of Nine on Liberia  in August 1996in Abuja  saw the Liberian factional leaders renew onceagain their support for the peace process and their pledgesto cooperate with the efforts to bring the AbujaAgreement back on track. Thus far we have been able torestore the capital  Monrovia  to its status as a safe havenand reinstate the Council of State and the LiberianNational Transitional Government. The ceasefire betweenthe warring factions in the country has remained largelyrespected  although there are still disturbing reports ofhostilities between some of the factions.We do appreciate the assistance of some individualcountries to ECOMOG  as well as the cooperation of theUnited Nations Observer Mission in Liberia  but we wishto stress once again that these modest forms of supportare grossly inadequate  viewed against the enormity of thetasks in Liberia and the present state of the economies ofECOWAS member States. The Liberian factional leadersare tired of the war. The subregion has been able tobroker peace amongst them  but it lacks the means toprovide the resources to implement the peace accord. Theinternational community should respond to the call forresources now or run the risk of the situation deterioratingonce again. We shall not tire of reminding theinternational community that this Organization  theSecurity Council in particular  bears the ultimateresponsibility for the maintenance of international peaceand security. Regional or subregional efforts like ours canonly complement  not substitute for  those of theinternational community  which must face itsresponsibilities more seriously in Liberia.For our part  we in Ghana have endeavoured overthe years to play the role assigned to us within the limitsof our resources in meeting our common responsibilitiestowards the maintenance of international peace andsecurity. Since our participation in the United Nationspeacekeeping operations in the Belgian Congo — nowZaire — in the 1960s  Ghana has been present in almostall the continents where United Nations peacekeepingduties call  and we are indeed proud of our contributionto these international peace efforts.On the threshold of the twenty-first century  wecannot hide our amazement that some people and theirGod-given territories remain under colonial or aliendomination and foreign occupation. Even moreastonishing is the fact that some otherwise democratic administering countries and colonial Powers fail to21recognize the inalienable right of the administered orcolonial peoples to self-determination  and they fail torecognize that colonial domination is among the worstforms of violations of the human rights and fundamentalfreedoms of colonial peoples.It is therefore no accident that we should be gravelyconcerned at the continuing lack of progress on the questionof Western Sahara. Despite all of its shortcomings  thesettlement plan agreed to by the parties to the WesternSahara problem  under the auspices of this Organization remains the best option for pursuing a long-lasting solutionin the interest of the Saharan people. We remain concernedthat the identification process has had to be suspended andthe Identification Commission withdrawn as a result of thefailure of the parties to agree on some relevant importantprocedures and modalities. To break the stalemate  dialogueis essential  and we once more call on the Assembly toencourage the principal parties to the conflict to engage under the auspices of the United Nations  in direct talks thatcan open the way for the continuation of the identificationprocess. Urgent attention and action is required to bring toan end the present unacceptable situation  which poses averitable threat to subregional  regional and widerinternational security.In a similar vein  we take this opportunity to reaffirmour unflinching support for the Middle East Peace Processinitiated at the Madrid Peace Conference in 1991 andculminating in the Oslo accords. Over the past five years several gains have been made  giving rise to hopes that ajust and comprehensive peace in the region is attainable thatwould take cognizance of the legitimate right to self-determination of the Palestinian people and their right to anindependent state. We therefore see the recent outbreak ofviolence in the area as a set-back to those laudable effortsand as a reflection of a growing mistrust on the part of theparties. We call on them to honour all their commitmentsunder the agreements reached and to bring the peaceprocess back on track. In this connection we welcome theefforts of the United States Administration to bring theparties together once more.I should like at this juncture to refer to the question ofthe United Nations sanctions imposed on Libya. TheOrganization of African Unity (OAU)  the League of ArabStates and the Non-Aligned Movement  which represent thevast majority of States and peoples of the world  have beencalling for some years now for the sanctions on Libya to belifted. Our call for dialogue and negotiations that could leadto an acceptable solution of the dispute between Libya andthe three permanent members of the Security Council  aswell as proposals for a fair trial of the two suspects inThe Hague  by Scottish judges and under Scottish law have not elicited the expected response. Let it not beconstrued that our calls are based merely on sentimentalconsiderations of regional solidarity. After carefulexamination of the facts as made known to theinternational community  and with due respect for thetenets of international law  we think that the three Statesconcerned need to reciprocate the flexibility shown by theLibyan authorities and help to bring to a close an issuethat has unjustifiably caused untold suffering to theinnocent people of Libya. Issues of this nature justify oursupport for the establishment of an international criminalcourt for the promotion and maintenance of internationalcriminal justice on a fair and equitable basis.The relics of the cold war in international relationsremain particularly on the Korean peninsula and in UnitedStates-Cuba relations. We believe that the four-party talksproposed to ease tension on the Korean peninsula shouldfoster dialogue  understanding and cooperation among allthe countries concerned and enhance the process aimed atthe eventual unification of the two Koreas. With regard toUnited States-Cuba relations  we hope that the blockadesand mutual exchanges of rhetoric will give way to a newera of dialogue and mutual respect  in tune with currenttrends in international relations.As has been eloquently stated by the Secretary-General in his Agenda for Peace  there can be nodevelopment without peace  just as there can be no peacewithout development. We are convinced that we need topursue development as a means of preventing most of theconflicts  tragedies and humanitarian disasters thatconfront the world today. We are enjoined under theCharter of the United Nations to“employ international machinery for the promotionof the economic and social advancement of allpeoples”.The need for concerted international action to restructurethe international economy; construct a new regime toguide trade  aid and resource flows; and address theproblems posed by environmental degradation  populationexplosion  the debt overhang  abject poverty and diseasein developing countries  cannot be overemphasized. Suchmeasures would redress the existing global economicinequalities and eradicate poverty in a way that willengender the peace and security that we all so dearlyneed. As expected  the series of global conferences heldrecently under the auspices of the United Nations  whichinvolved not only Governments but also non-22governmental organizations  civil society  the media and theprivate sector  have raised awareness of and built consensusaround a number of overarching issues concerningeconomic growth and sustainable development. The timehas come to shift into implementation gear and invest thesame political will and energy in the monitoring of thefollow-up process. We want to safeguard the environmentand the welfare of our children  eradicate poverty  ensuresustainable development  and mainstream gender concernsin all our activities at the national and international levels so that women and men participate fully and equally in allspheres of life as we approach the new dawn.It bears mentioning that Africa’s socio-economicdifficulties are further compounded by the twin processesof globalization and liberalization. Africa therefore needsthe special attention of the international community toensure that the profound economic and institutional reformsit is undertaking to create an enabling environment fordevelopment yield maximum benefit for its people. Thelaunching of the United Nations System-wide SpecialInitiative for Africa in March 1996  if fully implemented would contribute meaningfully to this endeavour.We are painfully aware that international financialsupport for Africa is insufficient and unreliable. It istherefore necessary for the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme (UNDP) in Africa to focus on the enhancementand strengthening of Africa’s subregional economicgroupings  which will serve as building blocks for anAfrican economic community. This in turn will ensureAfrica’s effective participation in the emerging globaleconomic order that is increasingly being shaped by theforces of globalization and economic liberalization.For our part  we in Ghana are coping  not withoutdifficulty  with the challenges posed by these forces including those that are concomitant with the structuraladjustment programmes that we have pursued for well overa decade. Coupled with these are those other imperativesthat come with the processes of democratization and goodgovernance. Our democratically elected Government willpresent itself to the electorate on 7 December 1996 to seeka fresh mandate to continue with the policies that haveensured stability and development in our country in recentyears.The entry into force of the United Nations Conventionon the Law of the Sea is a welcome development  and wefully appreciate the numerous efforts and variouscompromises that contributed immensely to putting intoplace the various organs of the International SeabedAuthority. We hope that adequate resources will be madeavailable to enable developing countries to utilize fully thebenefits  and also discharge the responsibilities  derivingfrom the Convention.The financial situation of our Organization remainsprecarious and a source of concern to my delegation. Thecrunch in the cash-flow situation has not changed for thebetter  principally because a number of countries including some of the largest  are neither paying theircontributions nor making good on their arrears. It isimportant for Member States to provide the UnitedNations system with the means and resources required toaccomplish the tasks assigned to it. Support for theUnited Nations should manifest itself not only in aneagerness to restructure it to make it more effective  butalso in the payment in full  on time and withoutconditions of assessed contributions  in order to promotethe successful pursuit of the objectives of theOrganization at a time of both challenge and opportunity.In addressing the cash-flow situation  we also wish todeplore the high degree of wastage and overlap in thesystem  especially during the start-up and liquidationphases of peacekeeping operations as well as in theproliferation of mandates. With the consolidation of theinternal oversight mechanisms into the Office of InternalOversight Services  coupled with the existing externaloversight mechanisms  it is hoped that the financialfunctioning of the Organization will be more cost-effective.I should like to conclude by reaffirming mydelegation’s support for the reforms currently beingpursued by the United Nations. In our view  the reformsin the financial administration of the Organization  therevitalization of its economic and social structures  thestrengthening of the General Assembly and theSecretariat  and the restructuring of the Security Councilall should contribute to a better functioning UnitedNations suited for the challenges ahead of us as we enterthe new millennium."
"63",2655,"GIN",51,1996,"﻿It is with real pleasure and great interest that I stand beforethe Assembly to convey the warm greetings of the peopleof Guinea and of its President  General Lansana Conte. Ijoin with the many preceding speakers in warmlycongratulating Ambassador Razali on his election to thepresidency of the fifty-first session of the GeneralAssembly. His election is testimony to the internationalcommunity’s high regard for Malaysia  his country  withwhich the Republic of Guinea is honoured to have specialties of friendship and cooperation. I am convinced thatunder his skilful guidance our work will enjoy everysuccess. I assure him of the support and cooperation of thedelegation of Guinea in this task.My congratulations also go to his predecessor Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral of Portugal who  with skilland clearsightedness  enabled the Assembly to address theconcerns of the international community during thefiftieth session.My country  the Republic of Guinea  takes thisopportunity to greet and stress our tribute to theSecretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  whosecourage  intelligence and tireless efforts have contributedsignificantly to the attainment of the Organization’s noblepurposes of peace  justice and progress. This is why mydelegation reiterates its support for his candidacy for asecond term of office  in accordance with the decision ofthe most recent Summit Meeting of the Organization ofAfrican Unity  held at Yaounde from 8 to 10 July 1996.A host of challenges are now threatening to upsetthe balance of the United Nations as we approach the endof the millennium. Despite encouraging results in termsof maintaining international peace and security  manyconflicts incompatible with people’s aspirations ofeconomic and social progress persist.In addition to the tensions and conflicts which aretearing peoples apart  of equal concern are the poverty unemployment  malnutrition and environmentaldegradation that continue to threaten the existence andfuture of many populations of the world. Today morethan ever there is an urgent need radically to restructureour common institution  the United Nations  so that it canadapt better to current changes  respond appropriately tothe expectations of our populations on the major questionswhich challenge humankind and make the outlook for thefuture one filled with hope.The need to prevent and settle conflicts  to supportthe efforts of States to ensure sustainable development  toprovide easier access to suitable housing and to guaranteesufficient food for all are now becoming elements of thepromotion of human rights. The same holds true for howwe deal with the implications of the globalization of theinternational economy through reliable mechanisms.The Republic of Guinea welcomes and stronglyencourages the initiative of Japan  our great friend  todesign and implement  with our countries  a newdevelopment strategy. In this respect  it supports theorganization in 1997 in Tokyo of the second InternationalConference on African Development in which itundertakes to play an active role from the preparatoryphase to the end of its work. We are convinced that there18is an urgent need and obligation to support firmly a newform of world partnership involving all nations  large andsmall.The Republic of Guinea  aware of the fresh challengesfacing developing countries on the eve of the thirdmillennium  has decided that its diplomacy should be basedon development. This role of diplomatic linchpin in the areaof economic advancement will not only strengthen ourcommitment to subregional and regional integration  butwill also increase significantly our participation ininternational trade.Questions of international peace and security mustremain at the forefront of our concerns. In this respect  mydelegation considers that the main role of the UnitedNations is to continue and intensify the search for ways andmeans to increase the effectiveness of its action in the areasof the maintenance of peace and of preventive diplomacy.My delegation welcomes the adoption of theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty  which I have justsigned on behalf of the Government of Guinea. We see thisas an important step towards total disarmament. If theTreaty is to attain all of its objectives  the main one beingto spare humanity from chaos  it must be signed andrespected by all States of the world. To do this  we mustcalmly and jointly seek to give the assurances of theinternational community to countries that hesitate to takethe decisive step towards the salvation of humanity  so thatin the near future the accession of all Member States of theUnited Nations will enshrine the universality of thisimportant Treaty.Along the same lines  my delegation calls on theinternational community to implement global measures toprohibit the illegal traffic of fissile materials  thetransborder trafficking in conventional small arms and theproduction  stockpiling and use of anti-personnel landmines.More than 110 million mines are now scattered around theworld  ready to explode at any time  indiscriminatelystriking down innocent civilian populations.The Republic of Guinea welcomes the adoption of thetext of Protocol II to the Convention on Prohibitions orRestrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional WeaponsWhich May be Deemed to Be excessively Injurious or toHave Indiscriminate Effects  on Mines  Booby-Traps andOther Such Devices during the Review Conference on theimplementation of that Convention.Other threats weigh heavily on international peaceand security. Our Organization must react vigorously tothe threats of terrorism  organized crime and drugtrafficking.Apart from their many disastrous consequences these threats  because they are transborder threats  mustbe considered as real dangers to the health  security andstability both of our populations and of our States.My delegation  while welcoming the decisions of theGroup of Seven and Russia on combatting terrorism andtransnational threats  believes that a more complete use ofthe potential of the United Nations as an instrument fordeveloping joint international strategies and cooperationamong all States in the area of fighting crime wouldallow for more effective coordination of the actions of theinternational community.We greatly appreciate the United Nations efforts inother areas as dangerous as terrorism: money-laundering trafficking in children and all related crimes. Fightingthese scourges of our time is everyone’s business.In Africa  tangible progress has been made in thearea of peace and democracy. The Republic of Guinea however  remains concerned by the conflicts whichcontinue to rage on the continent. In the West Africansubregion  the situations in Liberia and Sierra Leone havetangibly improved  despite some obstacles  which we arestriving to overcome within the context of the EconomicCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS) and itspeace force  the ECOWAS Monitoring Group(ECOMOG).The conflict in Liberia has lasted for seven longyears. It has caused the death of tens of thousands ofpeople and has led to a mass exodus of hundreds ofthousands of refugees to neighbouring States  includingmy country  the Republic of Guinea  on whose territoryare hundreds of thousands of refugees  to whom it offersassistance and protection while at the same timeespousing total neutrality in relation to other Statesmembers of ECOWAS in the search for a politicalsolution to end this conflict.The joint efforts of that subregional organizationwith such major forums as the Organization of AfricanUnity (OAU) and the United Nations led to the signing ofthe most recent peace agreements at Abuja  Nigeria. TheRepublic of Guinea  true to its policy of good-neighbourliness and neutrality  firmly supports these19agreements  which provide for free and transparent electionsin May 1997  and will ensure their strict implementation.An end to this conflict is of interest to the Republic ofGuinea  my country  mainly because of the presence on ourterritory of more than 650 000 refugees compared with apopulation of 7 million Guineans: one refugee for every 10inhabitants. This is a situation with rare precedents.Similarly  our participation in the peace effort places aheavy burden on our economy and compromises many ofour development projects.I would like to make an urgent appeal to all the partiesconcerned with this conflict to implement the AbujaAgreement in full  and in a timely manner  to the benefit ofstability in the subregion. The promises of assistance fromfriendly countries and by the international communitycould  if kept within the timetable  effectively lead the finalsettlement plan to success. The initiatives under way in thisregard are very encouraging. We welcome the action of theUnited States of America to assist ECOWAS peace effortsand thank the United States warmly for its latestcontribution to the financing of the activities of ECOMOG.The deterioration of the socio-political climate inBurundi stirs fears today of a repetition of the threatsexperienced in neighbouring Rwanda  a country with whichit shares many social  historical and cultural similarities.The continuation of this crisis also poses a serious threat tostability in the region and to peace. This is why the UnitedNations  together with neighbouring countries  must befurther involved in the search for a final solution to thiscrisis. We lend our full support to the recent decision takenby the OAU and by the conference of Heads of State of theGreat Lakes region  held at Arusha  against the Governmentstemming from the coup d’état. We urge all the sons ofBurundi and all those of good-will worldwide to supportOAU efforts towards the peaceful settlement of the crisesin Burundi and in Rwanda through dialogue  tolerance andreconciliation among the various communities.As regards Western Sahara  my Government supportsthe international community’s efforts for a peaceful solutionto this question  in accordance with the United Nationssettlement plan.With respect to Angola  my delegation stronglyencourages the Angolan Government and União Nacionalpara a Independência Total de Angola (UNITA) topersevere along the path to peace and nationalreconciliation on the basis of the implementation of andrespect for the Lusaka Protocol.Regarding the situation in Somalia  we must say thatleaving Somalians to their fate would be contrary to theUnited Nations ideal of solidarity. Despite the difficulties the United Nations must continue to be involved activelyin the process of restoring peace to that country  througha continuous search for mechanisms to promote nationalreconciliation  peace  security and stability in Somalia.On the Middle East  my Government remains greatlyconcerned by the latest developments in Jerusalem  inGaza and in the West Bank. The seriousness of theseevents could jeopardize the peace process. We areconvinced that rapid approach of Palestinian autonomy inthe Gaza Strip  in Jericho and in the West Bank  and thenecessary continuation of the peace process are theresponsibility of the entire international community. Thisis why my delegation solemnly calls upon all the partiesinvolved with the Middle East conflict  especially Israeland its Arab neighbours  to continue courageously on thepath of peace  through the pursuit of negotiations  inaccordance with the relevant Security Council resolutionsand the Peace Agreements.The Republic of Guinea  convinced that dialogue the creation of a climate of mutual trust and a greatermutual understanding constitute the only path towards alasting solution on the Korean peninsula  will continue toencourage the two Korean States to persevere in theirefforts towards independent and peaceful reunification.The signing of the Dayton Peace Agreement in 1995has opened up fresh prospects for the restoration andconsolidation of peace in the Balkans. With the recentelections in Bosnia  developments in the situationstrengthen the aspirations to peace  stability and securityof the region’s peoples. We must however remainvigilant. In this respect  my delegation welcomes andsupports the efforts of the United Nations  of theImplementation Force (IFOR) and of the internationalcriminal tribunal  aimed at consolidating peace andprosecuting those responsible for crimes against humanity.We invite the international community to display firmnessin dealing with this question  in order to extinguish anyre-emergence of the practices of “ethnic cleansing”. TheOrganization of the Islamic Conference must be involvedmore closely in the process begun in this country.The situation in Jammu and Kashmir continues todeteriorate. At its various summits and ministerialconferences  the Organization of the Islamic Conferencehas appealed to the international community to urge theprotagonists to abide by the relevant Security Council20resolutions and thus enable the Kashmiri people to exercisefreely its right to self-determination. We repeat this appeal and invite them to begin a constructive dialogue.The Contact Group on Jammu and Kashmir of theOrganization of the Islamic Conference  which is chaired bythe Republic of Guinea  requests the United Nations and theSecurity Council to shoulder all their responsibilities bybecoming decisively involved in the search for peace in theIndian sub-continent. Security Council resolutions 47(1948)  91 (1951) and 122 (1957) on Jammu and Kashmir which remain unimplemented after five decades  should notremain among the forgotten resolutions of our system. TheRepublic of Guinea therefore gives its full support to effortsby the Government of Pakistan aimed at finding a peacefulsolution to the problem of Jammu and Kashmir through theopening of talks with India.My country follows the development of the situationin Afghanistan with the greatest attention. It urges all theparties concerned to work fraternally for the restoration ofpeace and for national reconciliation.In the context of its actions within the Organization ofthe Islamic Conference  of which it is a founding memberand current Chairman of its Council of Ministers forForeign Affairs  the Republic of Guinea — a secularcountry with a strong Muslim majority — is dedicated topromoting understanding and tolerance among civilizations cultures and religions and to contributing to the rise of theforces of progress  justice and democracy in Muslimregions and in the world beyond.At a time when the world is experiencing profoundchanges of unequalled complexity and scope  it is essentialto promote and consolidate an international environmentthat will foster peace  growth and development. It isregrettable that Africa does not play a greater role in majorinternational negotiations. We must not continue to bespectators while the rest of the world carries outnegotiations which involve us directly or indirectly. We areconvinced that Africa has a role to play in this area.In the new configuration of today’s world  a countrysuch as the Republic of Guinea — through its policy ofpeace and because its interests do not diverge from those ofother regions of the world; through the nature of itssometimes exceptional relations with the parties in latent orovert conflicts in various regions; through its membershipin several geo-political groups  several cultural zones andseveral continental and non-African organizations — could where desirable  play a useful role in internationalnegotiations.The permanence and fairness of development will beillusory so long as modalities that preserve and perpetuatepresent inequalities continue to govern internationalrelations. Economic and social development  whosecorrelation with international peace and security is clear requires of States and of the international institutions thatare our development partners a pragmatic and coherentapproach which takes into account the specific socio-economic needs and realities of our States.My delegation is pleased with the efforts that havealready been made in the area of debt relief fordeveloping countries and appeals to the solidarity of theinternational community for a real increase indevelopment assistance  whose current tendency todecrease is a real source of concern for us in the face ofour pressing development needs. In this regard  wewelcome the decisions of the last summit of the Group ofSeven  held at Lyon.Although the conclusion of the Uruguay Roundopens up new prospects for the stimulation ofinternational trade  it is essential to introduce new energetic measures to save Africa from marginalizationand impoverishment. It is a human  social  political andeconomic imperative for the international community andfor all the actors and partners in development  in theirown specific actions  to work responsibly for a more justand equitable framework for international trade  favouringa free and democratic economic partnership.We therefore congratulate the Secretary-General Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali for his praiseworthy effortswhich have made it possible to develop the UnitedNations System-wide Special Initiative for Africa. Mycountry would like to express the hope that this will notsuffer from the same lethargy which the United NationsProgramme of Action for African Economic Recoveryand Development suffered from. Such a failure would behighly prejudicial and damaging to the credibility of theUnited Nations. In this regard  my delegation seeks theurgent implementation of this ambitious Initiative  for itis undeniable that it is one of the best ways of givingdevelopment a chance and new hope for futuregenerations.We would also like to express our satisfaction at theconvening of the second United Nations Conference onHuman Settlements and to support the important21resolutions arising from that Conference promoting accessto suitable housing for all.Along these lines  my delegation would like to takethis opportunity to welcome the holding of the World FoodSummit  which will take place from 13 to 17 November1996 at the headquarters of the Food and AgricultureOrganization of the United Nations.My Government believes that the enhancement of ourOrganization’s effectiveness lies above all in theredefinition of some of its objectives  especially in adaptingthe functioning of its organs to reflect better the new faceof international relations. With regard to the SecurityCouncil  my Government fully supports the review andexpansion of its current composition on the basis ofequitable geographical representation so that the southernhemisphere — which since 1945 has been the theatre ofmany conflicts — can participate in its activities which arefundamental to the maintenance of international peace andsecurity.My wish  therefore  is for the United Nations to carryout its restructuring. Whether with regard to revitalizing theGeneral Assembly and its organs  to expanding orstrengthening the Security Council  to rationalizingactivities and procedures  to redefining programmes andmandates or to consolidating the financial and materialbases of the Organization  all Member States must workwith courage  clarity and a high sense of responsibility forthe proper implementation of these reforms in order to givethe United Nations reliable and effective institutions worthyof the vision and aspirations of our peoples.That is why my delegation  while expressing itssatisfaction at the evident willingness and efforts of ourOrganization to adapt to the world’s changes  is in favourof strengthening its potential and improving the interactionamong the various organizations of the United Nationssystem and other development partners.In conclusion  the Republic of Guinea would like toexpress the hope that courageous and realistic decisions willcome out of the work of this session  and it remainsconvinced that — apart from divergences and differencesin approach in the search for ways and means to achievesolutions to the problems facing our States — the UnitedNations community which we constitute will continue towork successfully for peace  security and the well-being ofall  in the spirit of active solidarity  as the founding fathersof this Organization dreamed."
"64",2694,"GMB",51,1996,"I should like first of all tocongratulate Mr. Razali Ismail wholeheartedly on hisassumption of the presidency of this session. His closeassociation with the United Nations during these years ashis country’s representative makes him not only highlyqualified for the office but also fully cognizant of theactivities  including the needs and challenges  of this  ourgreat Organization. I would assure him of my delegation’ssupport at all times.In the same vein  I should like to extend appreciationto his predecessor  Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral  whoworked tirelessly to ensure that the work of the Assemblywas both effective and successful. My delegation’s thanksand gratitude also go to the Secretary-General  Mr. BoutrosBoutros-Ghali  for the successful holding of this session inthe face of serious financial and other constraints  and forthe selfless service he is rendering to our Organization. Thequality of his work  as well as his untiring efforts torevitalize our 50-year-old Organization  deserve our full andcollective support and encouragement. The Gambia remainscommitted to the Organization of African Unity’s (OAU)declaration of support for His Excellency Mr. BoutrosBoutros-Ghali to continue in office as Secretary-General fora second term.Last year  when the delegation of the Gambiaaddressed the Assembly  we dwelt at length on the twindemocratization and development processes in the Gambia.It is fitting today to report on the progress made so far andthe successes achieved. Concerning the democratizationprocess  I am pleased to inform this gathering that wesuccessfully conducted a referendum on 8 August 1996 toadopt a new Constitution  and we elected a new Presidenton 26 September 1996. These two activities have beencharacterized by a high sense of political maturity and civicinterest and a high level of voter turnout.The Constitution was adopted by a vote of 270 093 infavour against 113 744 opposed  with a total turnout of 86.9per cent for the referendum. Not only is this newConstitution the best we have ever had  but it also embracesthe people’s political expectations for the advent of a truesense of justice and fair play as well as their deep love offreedom  respect for human rights  and a strong nationalisticfeeling predicated on a desire to associate with the rest ofthe world on a free and equitable basis. Furthermore  thenew Constitution ensures that the Second Republic willprogress and flourish under the universally respectedprinciples of transparency  accountability and probity —a sine qua non for any honest and well-meaningGovernment. The presidential election  the penultimatephase of our two-year transitional programme  was heldon 26 September 1996. Four political parties presentedcandidates  and His Excellency Yahya A. J. J. Jammeh leader of the Alliance for Patriotic Reorientation andConstruction (APRC)  emerged as the winner. ThePresident-elect polled 220 011 votes  or about 56 per centof the total votes cast. This resounding victory indicatesa strong endorsement by the Gambian people of thepolicies of the now-dissolved Armed Forces ProvisionalRuling Council (AFPRC). The distribution of the resultsand the actual percentages of the votes captured by therespective candidates depict an election that was free andfair — free from the obvious abuses of the position ofincumbency.In keeping with the APRC’s philosophy of nationalunity  the President-elect has extended a message of peaceand reconciliation to all Gambians. In his address to thenation on 27 September 1996  following the presidentialelection  he said:“In democratic elections no voters lose  since theoutcome is the collective will of all.”He invited all Gambians  irrespective of politicalconviction or affiliation  to come together and work forthe development of the country. In concluding thedemocratization process  the Gambia will hold itsNational Assembly elections on 11 December 1996. Boththe Government and the Provisional Independent ElectoralCommission attach a great deal of importance to theseelections and have therefore been encouraging interestedparties and individuals to contest for seats in the NationalAssembly. We have no doubt that the peace andorderliness that characterized the referendum andpresidential election will prevail in the forthcomingelections.It is noteworthy that the electoral process in theGambia has been complemented by the Government’spriority development projects. During the last two years the Government demonstrated to the whole world that animportant ingredient of national development is thecommitment and honesty of a Government inimplementing realistic programmes for the benefit of itspeople. In the education sector  several primary  junior16General Assembly 25th plenary meetingFifty-first session 7 October 1996and secondary schools were built and a university extensionprogramme launched. In the area of communication  thecountry’s first-ever television station was commissioned and the international airport was expanded and modernized.Generally  there has been significant improvement andexpansion of the country’s road network to ease the chronictransportation problems. In the health sector  theGovernment has built a third referral hospital  and moredoctors and nurses have been recruited from inside andoutside the country. As regards the agricultural sector mechanization has received greater attention as a steptowards achieving food self-sufficiency. In short  more hasbeen achieved in all sectors of the economy during the twoyears of AFPRC rule than during the 30 years of theprevious regime.The resilience of the Gambian economy during the lasttwo years — in spite of the unjustified sanctions imposedon the Gambia by our development partners for purelypolitical reasons  and in the face of other powerful externalshocks deriving mainly from trends in the global economyand in world trade — has been reassuring. TheGovernment’s macroeconomic policies and developmentefforts have helped to create an enabling environment forprivate investment  including foreign direct investment. Ineffect  the country’s economic and financial performanceduring the 1995-96 year showed real gross domesticproduct growing by 3 per cent. The projections for 1996-97are for it to grow by 3.5 per cent  with inflation limited to5 per cent.As we forge ahead  we in the Gambia are proud of ourGovernment and its laudable achievements since it tookover the reins of power on 22 July 1994. We have learnedthe true meaning of democracy: an amicable partnershipbetween people and Government. It is through such apartnership that the Civic Education Programme wassuccessful and that Vision 2020 — a national strategy forsocio-economic development  aimed at raising the standardof living of the Gambian population — was launched.I should like at this stage to express the sinceregratitude of the Government and people of the Gambia forthe support and assistance received from some members ofthe international community during the critical period of thetransition programme. We fervently hope that this supportfrom our friends and well-wishers will continue to enableus successfully to conduct the National Assembly Electionson 11 December 1996. With the successful end of the two-year transition programme and the peaceful return of ourcountry to democratic civilian rule  we also expect that theinternational community will now join us in our pursuitto achieve sustainable development.The recently concluded United Nations Conferenceon Human Settlements (Habitat II) in Istanbul will godown in history as one of the most successfulinternational conferences organized by the United Nations.The Habitat Agenda  adopted by the Conference  reflectsgenerally the acute shortage of shelter and the growinginternational concern for more and better shelter.Adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlementdevelopment in an urbanizing world remain basic humanneeds and a universal concern. In fact  the statement bythe Secretary-General of Habitat II  Mr. Wally N’Dow that“Istanbul will be the gateway to development intothe next century” will hold true well into the twenty-first century. Thecommitment of the Government of the Gambia to theimplementation of the Habitat Agenda — including theGlobal Plan of Action and  in particular  the forging ofsustainable partnerships with all actors in the field ofhuman settlements — remains high.The mid-term review of the United Nations NewAgenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s inSeptember 1996 provided an opportunity to reviewprogress in Africa’s development. The review reaffirmedthe New Agenda as a fundamental and achievableprogramme for the socio-economic development ofAfrica  if both Africa and its development partners adhereto the programme’s stated responsibilities andcommitments. The review revealed the gradual butencouraging growth of the African economy  with anincreased gross domestic product (GDP) of 2.3 per centin 1995  as compared to 2.1 per cent in 1994. Theimplementation of the New Agenda  however  continuesto be constrained by failure to achieve the United Nationstarget of devoting 0.7 per cent of the GDP of developedcountries  including 0.15 per cent of their GNP  foroverseas development assistance to the least developedcountries.Africa’s huge external debt burden  which grew at anaverage annual rate of 1.5 per cent between 1990 and1995  remains the single most serious constraint toAfrica’s consistent economic recovery and sustainabledevelopment. Major donors  creditors and the internationalcommunity should collectively devise a multilateral debt-17General Assembly 25th plenary meetingFifty-first session 7 October 1996relief programme aimed at completely writing off the debtof developing countries by the turn of the century. Theimplementation of the United Nations System-wide SpecialInitiative for Africa alongside the New Agenda  and incollaboration with the Bretton Woods institutions and otheragencies  will constitute a new and dynamic globalapproach of working with Africa to accelerate itsdevelopment. The attainment of the objectives of theSpecial Initiative within a decade will depend to a largeextent on the availability of new and additional funds rather than on the reprioritizing of programmes andremarshalling of funds identified under the New Agenda.Only in this way can the international community realize —as the President of the World Bank  Mr. Wolfensohn  saidin connection with the launching of the Special Initiative —that“there is a need for us to give the push  that help  theassistance which can keep the momentum”.Globalization continues to hold much attraction  but itsbenefits continue to elude the majority of developingcountries. The impact of globalization and liberalization onemployment and sustainable socio-economic developmentin general has been negative. The recent Ninth Meeting ofthe United Nations Conference on Trade and Development(UNCTAD) in South Africa  while reaffirming theinternational community’s commitment to partnership fordevelopment  recognized the disparities among nations aswell as the need to help developing countries reap thebenefits of globalization and development and to ensuretheir full and effective participation in the world economyon an equitable basis.The case of the least developed countries has alwaysreceived the attention and support of the internationalcommunity  particularly through the adoption of the ParisDeclaration and the Programme of Action for the LeastDeveloped Countries for the 1990s. The mid-term globalreview of this Programme of Action  held in September1995  failed to confirm the realization of the programme’sprimary objective  which is to arrest and reverse thedeterioration in the socio-economic situation in the leastdeveloped countries and to revitalize their growth anddevelopment. It is noted that the lack of progress inimproving the socio-economic performance of LDCs isattributable  in the main  to the failure of the internationalcommunity to provide the necessary support and assistancethrough official development assistance  debt relief andbenefits from globalization and liberalization. The successof the Programme of Action during the second half of itsexistence will depend to a large measure on the amountof international support for the economic growth of leastdeveloped countries.The attainment of international peace and securityremains a vital aspect of our Organization’s work. It isfor these reasons that my delegation joins the internationalcommunity in supporting the United Nations effort toensure peace and the resolution of conflicts throughoutthe world. In this regard  the set-back in the peace processevidenced by the upheaval of April 1996 in Liberia wasof great concern to the international community.However  thanks to the ceaseless efforts of the EconomicCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS) especially through its Committee of Nine on Liberia  thepeace process is back on track  and so far there has beensatisfactory progress on its implementation. In spite of thedifficulties encountered over the past few years in theimplementation of the Abuja Agreement  it is still ourfirm belief that the Agreement remains the bestframework for restoring durable peace to Liberia. Withthe genuine commitment and goodwill of all parties andthe continued support of the international community especially the United Nations  I am confident that alasting solution will soon be found.The situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina gives somehope that the brokered peace will continue to hold. Theelections of 14 September 1996 and the new federalGovernment which has been created should hopefully leadto national unity and reconciliation.It is sad to note that the civil war in Somalia  aftersimmering down for some time  has suddenly flared upagain. The renewed fighting has put a great deal of strainon the peace process. The efforts of the Organization ofAfrican Unity and of the international community ingeneral to contain hostilities and restore peace  securityand stability continue to receive our fullest support.The dramatic deterioration of the situation inBurundi is a major source of concern for all peace-lovingpeople the world over. We are indeed saddened by thespate of ethnic killings in this country  which continue toclaim many innocent lives. It is our collectiveresponsibility to put an end to this sorry state of affairsand thus avert a replay of the tragic events that occurredin neighbouring Rwanda some two years ago. In thisregard  we continue closely to monitor the evolution ofthe political situation in Burundi and hope that peace security and order will be permanently restored. We18General Assembly 25th plenary meetingFifty-first session 7 October 1996therefore strongly support the OAU peace initiatives  inparticular the Mwanza peace process and the Arusha peaceinitiative  aimed at guaranteeing security and democracy forall people in Burundi.The peace dividend so far achieved in our search fora lasting peace in the Middle East should not be allowed tofade away. Rather  we should continue to pursue the peaceprocess in order to achieve a lasting peace in the region onthe basis of the relevant Security Council resolutions.The quest for peace is a universal concern of theinternational community. At the same time  the desire forequality and recognition continues to elude some nations.The Republic of China on Taiwan’s quest for recognitionand readmission into the United Nations has failed to havethe necessary impact on the attitude and goodwill of theinternational community. Today  the Republic of China onTaiwan stands very high in the international arena in thefield of economic growth and social development. It isnoted not only for its economic achievements  but also forits exemplary political reform. The direct election of itsPresident on 23 March 1996  an event unprecedented inChinese history  marked the culmination of Taiwan’spolitical democratization. This accomplishment ought to berecognized by the United Nations  in accordance also withthe principle of universality. My country believes that theprecedent of parallel United Nations membership  whichapplied to the former East Germany and West Germany andcurrently applies to North Korea and South Korea  shouldbe applied in the case of the Republic of China on Taiwan.Besides the membership factor  which is in accordancewith Article 4 of the United Nations Charter  there is ajustice factor relating to Articles 1 and 2 of the sameCharter. It is regrettable that this factor was not included inour debate when the matter was considered at the meetingof the General Committee of the General Assembly  heldon 18 September 1996  in connection with the item on thedraft agenda entitled “Consideration of the exceptionalsituation of the inability  resulting from General Assemblyresolution 2758 (XXVI)  of the 21.3 million people onTaiwan  Republic of China  to participate in the activitiesof the United Nations”. As we all know  one can quantifynumbers of signatures  but not emotions — that is sympathy with and an interest and belief in the justificationand rightness of the case of Taiwan. It is our convictionthat the parallel participation of the two sides of the Taiwanstrait in the United Nations and other internationalorganizations would be conducive to the maintenance ofpeace and security in the Asia-Pacific region and in theworld in general. Let us therefore give the Republic ofChina on Taiwan the opportunity to share with us theircapabilities and experience in a collective effort to realizehumankind’s hope for the equitable development of everyregion of the world.The practice of the unilateral imposition of aneconomic embargo against one Member State by anotherMember State should have ceased with the end of thecold-war era. For more than three decades now  Cuba hasstruggled  against all odds  to survive economically andfinancially. With patience and determination  Cuba hascontinued to make great strides towards socio-economicdevelopment. Indeed  among the family of nations  it hasexcelled in some activities of common benefit tohumankind  such as genetic engineering and modernmedicine. These laudable achievements and progressmade by Cuba deserve to be encouraged.The application of the principles of international lawand the effort of the international community to propagatepeace and security should be all-embracing. In thisconnection  as regards Libya’s alleged complicity in thedowning over Lockerbie  Scotland  of Pan Am flight 103 we support the OAU resolution adopted by the sixty-fourth session of the Council of Ministers in Yaoundéfrom 1 to 5 July 1996  as a basis for overcoming thepresent impasse on the issue.Concerning the Jammu and Kashmir dispute  wewould like to urge the international community not torelent in its efforts to find a just and peaceful settlementto the dispute in accordance with the relevant resolutionsof the Security Council. The Gambia reaffirms itscommitment to the international community’s resolve tocombat naked aggression  particularly between States  andinternational terrorism from whatever quarter. Pursuant tothe relevant Security Council and Organization of theIslamic Conference (OIC) resolutions  we support theefforts of Kuwait to preserve and defend its territorialintegrity while seeking a just and speedy redress to theconsequences of the Iraqi invasion.Last year we celebrated the fiftieth anniversary ofthe United Nations. The occasion afforded us theopportunity to review the operations and mandate of theOrganization. The ongoing exercise of strengthening theUnited Nations system is complementing this review andthe rededication to the ideals of the United Nations. Inparticular  we should give our full support to therevitalization of the work of the General Assembly and19General Assembly 25th plenary meetingFifty-first session 7 October 1996the Economic and Social Council  and to the reform of theSecurity Council — including the question of equitablerepresentation of all geographical regions on this importantorgan of the United Nations. The proposals for the reformof the Security Council made by the African Group andItaly  among others  should also be given due consideration.The reform of the Security Council should ensure that thehegemonistic interests of a few will not be promoted to thedetriment of the majority.The reforms of the United Nations put in sharp focusthe present financial crisis of the Organization and thegallant efforts of the Secretary-General to improve itsfinancial situation. The serious consideration the GeneralAssembly has given this matter since 1994  leading to itssetting up a High-level Open-ended Working Group on theFinancial Situation of the United Nations  once moredemonstrates Member States’ commitment to thepreservation and continued operations of the Organization.The cumulative effect of the financial reforms  includingthe huge staff reductions  should  as much as possible neither compromise the efficiency and productivity of theOrganization nor deflect it from its traditional operationsand renewed mandate. The Organization’s precariousfinancial situation is our collective concern  and we shouldtherefore resolutely strive to ensure that it is promptlyaddressed. This of course requires that all Member Stateshave the clear political will to pay their contributionspunctually. Member countries should desist fromwithholding their contributions for purely politicalconsiderations  as this would paralyse the functioning of theUnited Nations.It is fitting at this juncture to refer to the work of thisbody in pursuing the objectives of the Agenda for Peaceand the Agenda for Development. The search for a commonbasis for international cooperation on conflict resolution relief operations and development remains an active agendaof the United Nations. The success of any internationalcooperation on these issues would require greater focus onthe effective implementation of the development prioritiesof developing countries. The link between peace anddevelopment is not only essential but forms part of theUnited Nations Charter. The two serve as twin pillars of theinternational community’s effort to achieve universal peaceand security based on the promotion of the social andeconomic development of all peoples. We remain fullycommitted to their effective realization.The manifold problems of illicit drug trafficking andabuse are becoming increasingly universal. In manyrespects  both producer and non-producer nations arerapidly falling victim to the pernicious effects of illicitdrugs. Today countries that once were drug free are eithergradually becoming infested with the sale and use ofillicit drugs or are being made transit posts in the illicittrafficking of narcotics and psychotropic substances. Formany years now  the United Nations has led a steady  all-embracing fight against the global drug menace especially through its International Drug ControlProgramme and Global Programme of Action  and recently  by making drugs the subject of the 1996 high-level segment of the Economic and Social Councilsession. The effort of the United Nations in combating thetrafficking and sale of illicit drugs cannot succeed unlessthe international community lends it its full supportthrough improved and effective international cooperationin drug control. The Gambia will continue to participatein any international effort to combat and defuse the globaldrug menace. At the national level  appropriate organsand control measures have been put in place to discouragethe use of the Gambia as a transit post in the illicit globaldrug trade and to save Gambians from falling victim to itsharmful effects.In the area of nuclear disarmament  it is gratifyingto note that the General Assembly recently adopted theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. Thatendorsement by the international community should not however  overlook the legitimate concerns andreservations expressed by India.The convening of the World Food Summit nextmonth in Rome to address hunger and food securityprovides the opportunity to renew the internationalcommunity’s commitment to the eradication of hungerand malnutrition and the attainment of food security forall.The linkage between the problem of food securityand poverty cannot be overemphasized. The Gambia within the framework of the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme and in observance of the International Yearfor the Eradication of Poverty (1996)  has beenparticipating effectively in the fight against poverty.National programmes have been designed and put in placeto achieve poverty eradication.The last decade of the twentieth century haswitnessed some landmark activities in internationalcooperation. The series of United Nations globalconferences signifies the international community’s20General Assembly 25th plenary meetingFifty-first session 7 October 1996preoccupation with the preservation of international peaceand security  the promotion and preservation of humanrights and fundamental freedoms  the propagation ofdevelopment techniques and the attainment of sustainabledevelopment  the provision of adequate shelter for ourrapidly growing population and  indeed  the attempt toensure the social and economic well-being of all peoples allover the world.The Gambia is proud to be associated with thisinternational crusade for a secure and better life for everyhuman being."
"65",2734,"GNB",51,1996,"﻿I wish to congratulate the President warmly onhis election to the presidency of the General Assembly andto reiterate our trust in his qualities and skills  which willhelp in conducting the work of this session. I assure himthat the delegation of Guinea- Bissau is ready and willingto help him.We would also like to congratulate his predecessor Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral  for the devotion andconstructive spirit with which he carried out his duties.We take this opportunity to underscore ourappreciation to and reiterate our confidence in theSecretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  whoseinitiative and personal involvement in the reform of theUnited Nations system have made satisfactory resultspossible.Last year  over 185 States met in New York City tocommemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations.This historic event was an excellent opportunity for theUnited Nations to evaluate and assess the state of ourOrganization in a changing world and to cast a glanceforward into the future.Today  as yesterday  a large part of the world’spopulation — which  to date  has experienced neither peacenor security  not to mention social well-being — place theirtrust in the United Nations  the only institution with auniversal mission  capable of promoting international peaceand security and developing socio-economic cooperation ona global scale.The numerous challenges and hopes which the UnitedNations must respond to today are unprecedented. It istherefore important that we make every effort to restructureand revitalize the Organization  because the United Nationsis facing an increasingly complex international situation.In that connection  we commend the Open-EndedWorking Group on the Question of EquitableRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of theSecurity Council for its contribution to overall effortsmade on this important and timely question. Guinea-Bissau is of the view that all related proposals of theAfrican Group  and other proposals such as that of Italy should be given due consideration.In a world beset by numerous grave conflicts  theUnited Nations is incontrovertibly  the best forum forachieving the ideals which underpin its irreplaceable rolein promoting international peace and security.However  despite the ongoing efforts of ourOrganization  peace and stability are still a dream inmany parts of the world. Conflicts and fratricidal warfare and the persistence of various kinds of serious tensionamong States  have made innocent victims of entirepopulations  causing loss of human life and provokingmassive movements of peoples and refugees.Unfortunately  Africa is the continent most affected bythis tragedy. Angola  Burundi  Liberia  Rwanda andSomalia are dramatic examples of Africa’s recent history.My recent visit to Angola — which coincided withmy country’s presidency of the Security Council — asSpecial Envoy of the President of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau  Mr. Joa¯o Bernardo Vieira  demonstrated ourpeople’s long-standing solidarity with the people ofAngola and illustrates our unequivocal will to promoteconfidence among the parties  which is essential to thesuccess of the peace process.In that connection  we should like to stress theimportant role of the United Nations  the Troika and theSpecial Representative of the Secretary-General Mr. Blondin Beye  in the establishment of the peaceprocess in Angola. We are convinced that the road wehave travelled and the successes achieved to date fullywarrant the confidence of the international communityand its continued support for the peace process in Angola.Guinea-Bissau hopes that the reasons for the delay of thefull implementation of the Lusaka Protocol will beovercome.We deplore the tragedy that is dividing Liberia  acountry of our subregion  just as we deplore the ongoingviolations of the agreements concluded  which increasethe loss of human life and provoke new outbreaks ofviolence. We are also gravely concerned to note thenegative impact of the war in Liberia on the neighbouringcountries.We urge all warring factions to respect the newimplementation plan of the Abuja Agreement and of theLiberian National Transitional Government. We also invitethem to cooperate fully with the Economic Community ofWest African States Monitoring Group  the United NationsObserver Mission in Liberia and the rest of the internationalcommunity in the search for a definitive solution to theproblem in Liberia.The situation in the Great Lakes region  particularlythe situation prevailing in Burundi  is also of great concernto us. We support the efforts of the United Nations and theOrganization of African Unity to avoid a repetition of theRwandan tragedy in these countries.As for Western Sahara  we reiterate our support forthe efforts of the Secretary-General of the United Nationsto organize the referendum.Guinea-Bissau continues to focus special attention onthe situation in East Timor which needs a negotiated peaceful  political approach if a solution is to be found. Inthis context  we would like to welcome the talks betweenPortugal and Indonesia under the auspices of the UnitedNations to find a just solution to this conflict.On behalf of our Government  I reiterate our firmconviction that the Republic of China on Taiwan should bepart of the United Nations on the basis of respect for theprinciple of universality and for the legal equality of States.The fundamental rights of 21 million inhabitants of aterritory under the jurisdiction of a legal Government whosePresident has been democratically elected provide thepolitical and legal basis for the recognition of their right tointernational status as a sovereign State under the legal andjudicial terms enshrined in the Charter of the UnitedNations.The reunification of China is a question that must beresolved by the people of China itself. However  theRepublic of China on Taiwan is legally entitled to enjoyinternational status before reunification — in other words its recognition as a State and application of the principle ofparallel representation of divided States.It is essential that the Middle East peace process besupported. We consider that any lasting solution to theMiddle East conflict must respect the inalienable rights ofthe Palestinian people to self-determination and to theestablishment of an independent State  and must respect theindependence and territorial integrity of all States of theregion  including the State of Israel  and their right to livein security within internationally recognized boundaries.The tragic events of recent days have weakened the peaceprocess while seriously affecting world public opinion.We urge the State of Israel and the Palestinian Authorityto persevere on the path of dialogue towards therestoration of a climate of trust  which is vital for theestablishment of lasting peace. We welcome the meetingbetween President Arafat and Prime Minister Netanyahu which is an important step on that path. We commend allparties that are contributing to the restoration of theIsrael-Palestinian dialogue  especially the Government ofthe United States of America.The holding of elections in Bosnia and Herzegovinais a positive element in the resolution of this crisis inEurope. We hope that all the parties concerned willhenceforth devote all their energies to the reconstructionof that devastated country  to ensure a future of peace tolerance and development.The embargo against Cuba  whose repercussionsgravely affect the people of that country  must beresolved through dialogue and negotiation by the partiesconcerned  with a view to achieving a complete andsatisfactory solution.Poverty  malnutrition  hunger and major endemicdiseases are a painful reality that affects a large part ofthe population of developing countries. We welcome theconvening at Rome next November of the World FoodSummit  organized by the Food and AgricultureOrganization of the United Nations (FAO).Guinea-Bissau is convinced that internationalsecurity and stability depend on the collective struggleagainst all the internal and external factors that force alarge part of the world’s population to live in abjectpoverty. Indeed  the persistence of poverty throughout theworld requires an ongoing sustained effort on the part ofthe community of nations and calls for a global approachto resolve the major socio-economic problems affectingthe world.The debt burden and debt-servicing gravelyjeopardize development in Africa. During recent years  aswas clearly demonstrated by the mid-term review of theUnited Nations New Agenda for the Development ofAfrica in the 1990s  our countries have become netexporters of capital because of the financial agreementsthey must honour. Indeed  the amounts allocated to debt-servicing greatly exceed external resource flows. Guinea-12Bissau is no exception. Overall  third world economies haveseen little improvement.The gap between developed and developing countriescontinues to grow because of the slow rate of economicgrowth in the developing countries in general and the least-developed countries in particular.We welcome the actionundertaken by the United Nations  especially the System-wide Special Initiative for Africa. My Governmentcontinues to devote considerable efforts to the economicrecovery of our country  strictly applying the structuraladjustment programme agreed with the World Bank and theInternational Monetary Fund. However  efforts to restoreour country’s macroeconomic balance and the well-being ofour people should be supplemented by additional supportfrom the international community  which we hope willcontinue to be forthcoming in support of our efforts in thatdirection.Guinea-Bissau  an African country and a member ofthe Portuguese-speaking community  welcomes Portugal’sinitiative to propose to its European Union partners theconvening of a European-African summit  whose objectivewould be to promote a political dialogue aimed at laying anew foundation for a new global partnership.Environmental protection and the rational utilization ofour planet’s natural resources are the responsibility of allhumanity. Aware of this reality  Guinea-Bissau hasdesigned with its cooperation partners a strategy forsustainable development that respects environmental balanceand which can be considered socially viable and just. Inthat context  our Government is making considerable effortsto implement the recommendations of the CopenhagenWorld Summit for Social Development  the Platform ofAction of the Fourth World Conference on Women  held atBeijing  and the recommendations of the second UnitedNations Conference on Human Settlements  held atIstanbul.Respect for and the full exercise of basic human rightsare elements of freedom  peace and international stability.Guinea-Bissau  a democratic country  is resolved topreserve intrinsic human values  for harmonious andintegrated development. The United Nations is intended tobe the appropriate forum for finding concertedcomprehensive solutions to the major challenges facing theworld today. That is why it is vital to increase its ability toprevent conflicts and preserve peace and to promote socio-economic development. Today Guinea-Bissau  more thanever before  is determined to contribute to the achievementof the ideals enshrined in the United Nations Charter."
"66",2773,"GNQ",51,1996,"﻿At the outset  Sir  allow meto join with earlier speakers in congratulating Mr. RazaliIsmail on his election as President of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-first session. His election isunquestionably a recognition of the role that his countryhas been playing in advancing the ideals of ourOrganization. It is also a great honour  and a personaltribute to his well-known experience as a diplomat. Wewish him every success in his work during this session.We are aware of the substantial number of topics fordiscussion during this session  and their subject matter.First  however  I wish to discharge the duty given me bythe President of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea  HisExcellency Obiang Nguema Mbasogo  and convey to therepresentatives of the friendly countries meeting heretoday his greetings and wishes for success in their workduring this session.A rapid review of our agenda reveals that many ofthe issues go to the heart and central purposes of theUnited Nations. However  it is also true that most of themhave been the subject of broad-ranging and thoroughdebate at many other sessions of the Assembly. To avoidrepetition  therefore  I shall briefly sum up my country’sposition on these main issues.During the past 50 years the United Nations hasconstantly worked to heighten the awareness of the12international community and the conscience of the worldwith respect to international peace and stability  justice equality and development throughout the world. We do notwish to sound pessimistic  but this session of the Assemblyis taking place in a context of great uncertainty. Some areeven questioning whether the United Nations still has theability to contribute to solving the problems that have arisenon a daily basis in recent years. For this reason  the firstproblem that we must face is whether what we have beenbuilding over the past 50 years is valid when tackling theseissues. For Equatorial Guinea  the answer is “yes” inprinciple. However  we must also acknowledge that thesystem we invented 50 years ago must be adapted tocurrent realities.Apart from considering the various options forreforming the United Nations system  we must askourselves seriously whether we are prepared to provide theOrganization with the legal machinery to make its importantdecision-making bodies — the General Assembly andSecurity Council — more democratic. My country believesthat the credibility of the United Nations is at stake. Wehave within our grasp an opportunity to make the UnitedNations the centre for the global harmonization of ourendeavours to achieve the common purposes articulated inthe Charter. When making decisions that affect all thecountries in our Organization  therefore  the necessaryconsensus must prevail for us to find appropriate solutions.Given this belief  I wish to make a modest contribution oncertain issues that we consider vital to the Organization.Reform of the Security Council is an extremelyimportant and complex issue  which calls for very carefulthought. Equatorial Guinea is in favour of establishingmachinery to allow for broad consensus in the decisionstaken by that body. We therefore support the arguments ofthose who believe that there is a need for an increase in thenumber of permanent and non-permanent members of theSecurity Council.We believe that  as others have said  exercise of theveto should evolve towards mechanisms that will make itsuse more objective. The United Nations should also keep inmind the fact that the cooperation that will makesustainable economic development possible in thedeveloping countries is not just an option; it is animperative  if we wish to eradicate the poverty anddestitution that breed violence and socio-political instabilityin many countries and regions of the world.Present-day Equatorial Guinea has learnt the hardlesson of what it means to live in democracy and pluralismin a difficult socio-economic climate. Therefore  webelieve that the preservation of peace and stability and thefostering of democracy are closely linked to the right ofall the world’s peoples to development.For that reason  Equatorial Guinea is concernedabout the fate that the resolutions adopted at fourimportant world summit meetings of recent years — theUnited Nations Conference on Environment andDevelopment at Rio de Janeiro  the World Summit forSocial Development at Copenhagen  the Fourth WorldConference on Women at Beijing and the World Summitfor Children at New York — can expect at the hands ofthe international community. Are we once more going tofail to fulfil the hopes of our peoples  who had rejoicedto see the Organization take such salutary initiatives? Thedebt problem remains unresolved  although timid stepshave recently been taken by the World Bank and theInternational Monetary Fund.Where my country’s domestic affairs are concerned we are building a participatory democracy founded on thepeople  by the people and for the people. Thus  ourdevelopment policy is concentrated on the welfare of ourcitizens. Indeed  within that approach the Government ofEquatorial Guinea is pursuing a programme to promotehuman rights  with the technical and financial assistanceof the United Nations Centre for Human Rights. In thisconnection  a number of courses and seminars are beingoffered for public order and security personnel as well asfor administrative and judicial authorities responsible forlaw and order.We are daily and progressively enhancing the degreeof democratization of State political structures at the ruralcommunity  municipal  parliamentary and governmentallevels to facilitate transition.In the economic sphere our efforts are directed toreforms that will be an impetus to sustainabledevelopment that can improve the standard of living ofour population. Nevertheless  we must note here mycountry’s concern at a trend in the internationalcommunity to erect barriers that hinder the efforts beingmade by many developing countries to harness theresources needed for development.In recent years  in fact  we have witnessed acontradictory phenomenon: on the pretext of calling forthe restoration of unquestioned principles of democracyand respect for human rights  many developing peoplesare being deprived of the resources that will enable them13to meet their basic needs. The donor community must  onceand for all  learn to distinguish between the demands ofcertain selfish political interests and the aspirations ofpeoples to freedom  democracy and development.In the case of Equatorial Guinea  our aspirations toconsolidate a State based on the rule of law  democracy anddevelopment are held hostage to certain intransigent andradical political groups that are deliberately flooding theinternational community with disinformation that runscounter to my country’s present-day socio-political realities.For a number of years now  either out of ignorance orbecause of vested interests  the donor community haswielded the weapon of economic blockade  which has madeit impossible to establish democracy on a sure footing in anumber of countries.However  we are pleased to inform the Assembly thatour ideals of peace  republican order and healthy socialcoexistence have enabled Equatorial Guinea today to attractworld interest. Foreign investment is increasing at a rapidrate  cooperation with friendly countries and internationaleconomic institutions is growing and economic growth willexceed 7 per cent by the end of this year. We believe thatultimately Equatorial Guinea will be able to lay thefoundation for the country’s overall development in allareas.We would therefore like to take this opportunity toappeal to the international community gathered here tojudge Equatorial Guinea by what is actually happeningthere  and thus to confirm the objective reality of ourmovement towards progress and prosperity."
"67",2819,"GRC",51,1996,"﻿Allow me to extend thewarmest congratulations of my Government to thePresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-first sessionon his election. I would also like to express our deepappreciation to his predecessor  Mr. Diogo Freitasdo Amaral  whose leadership during the fiftieth sessionwas a valuable asset for the Organization.I also seize this opportunity to express my deepappreciation to the Secretary-General  Mr. BoutrosBoutros-Ghali  for his dedication to his duties since 1992.The Foreign Minister of Ireland  as President of theCouncil of the European Union  delivered a statement towhich my Government fully subscribes  as it does to theUnion’s memorandum. I would like  however  toelaborate further on some issues that are of particularinterest to my country.Let us remember the message delivered by the worldleaders during the special commemorative meeting of thisbody: the Organization needs to undergo a seriousreorganization in order to be ready to confront thechallenges of the years ahead. The political commitmentof the Member States and the contribution of adequateresources constitute two fundamental prerequisites for thesuccess of the United Nations.Unfortunately  few noteworthy proposals have beenput forward concerning the comprehensive modernizationeffort to enable the Organization to become more efficientand transparent in the fulfilment of its functions whilerationalizing the use of its resources.It is the Member States that have endowed theUnited Nations with its current features. Even if theOrganization’s administrative weaknesses were fullyremedied  the power of extensive correction andlong-overdue reform lies not in this building  but in ourown capitals.At this stage  we are faced with two alternatives:either curtail demands on the United Nations  giving it areasonable chance of carrying out reduced policies withinits existing resources  or recognize the need to improve itscapacities and grant it greater functions  as well as thenecessary means. Greece strongly advocates the secondpath  because the need for the world Organization isgrowing  not shrinking. Year by year  we move closer tomenacing demographic  socio-economic and ecologicalthresholds. The only chance we have to deal withtransnational problems is to work out transnational4responses. We need to cooperate constructively towardscommon ends.It would be extremely difficult  if not impossible  forthe United Nations to face the current financial crisis ifMember States were to deprive the world Organization ofthe resources and assets that they have contractuallypledged of their own free will. In this context  it should bestressed yet again that no amount of savings will  by itself permit the United Nations to be solvent  and that none ofthe Member States  in particular those that play a majorrole in the Organization’s decision-making process and inthe definition of its activities  should have second thoughtswhen it comes to footing their part of the bill.Let us be clear: the whole reform is endangered by thelooming atmosphere of imminent financial collapse. Evenworse  the United Nations  and all the principles that itstands for  are exposed to the danger of being discredited perhaps forever  even in the eyes of its warmest supporters.This is a much more fundamental issue than improvementsto specific parts of the system  welcome and needed thoughthe latter may be.Earlier this year  the European Union outlined acomprehensive package to address the financial crisis.Furthermore  Greece  on a national basis  respondedpositively to the Secretary-General’s appeal and decided toincrease its annual contribution to the peacekeeping-operations budget  thus moving on a voluntary basis fromGroup C to Group B of countries that contribute to thefinancing of the Organization’s peacekeeping activities. Asa result  our contribution will increase by 500 per cent bythe year 2000  when the process of gradual reallocation willhave been completed.It has become increasingly fashionable to argue thatthe idea of a world community is alive in the humanimagination  though not yet in the world of action; that theconcept of collective security has failed to take root becauseit does not reflect the spirit of the age; that the publicmultilateral approach cannot be effective in conflictresolution  because there are no collective solutions toindividual crises; and that behind-the-scenes diplomacy which pursues relatively modest goals  will always be betterat keeping conflict within reasonable limits  because it willcompromise between what justice demands and whatcircumstances permit.In the light of past and recent experience  the Greekpeople certainly do not have immoderate illusions in thisregard. The case of Cyprus is a striking example of theinability of the international community to ensureimplementation of clear-cut United Nations resolutionsand to tackle the problem of the ongoing occupation ofone Member State by another following an act of militaryaggression. To cite just one other example  Greece isthreatened with war in the event it applies the provisionsof the Convention on the Law of the Sea  which has beensigned by all Member States  except for the one thatmade it clear that it would not hesitate to use force forthe maintenance and defence of its vital interests.However  it would be totally wrong to discardmultilateralism just because of the persistence of attitudesthat assuage consciences without solving the problems.We have to strike a positive balance between vision andreality  because no society  and certainly not theinternational community  can aspire to human  economicand social development without a stable and legallyappropriate framework.Throughout its existence  the United Nations has notjust constituted the main  if not the only  incarnation ofthe global spirit of hope. The principles enshrined in itsCharter have established a code of conduct for States which have the duty to contribute to the maintenance ofinternational peace and security  to refrain from the threator use of force  and to settle disputes by exclusivelypeaceful means and in accordance with international law.Moreover  the Organization itself has often been asuccessful instrument for the prevention and managementof conflicts.If power politics are allowed to be deployed in thepursuit of exclusive and narrow interests in a climate ofconfrontation  if the world’s resources are shared on thebasis of military power rather than of international treatiesand conventions  if priority is not given to internationallaw and international cooperation  and if we attempt toevade the responsibilities that we have all undertakenunder the Charter  however appealing and convenient thatmight appear in the short term  we will sow the seeds ofchaos  anarchy and rapid disintegration. The UnitedNations offers the only framework in which to achievethe important objective of enforcing internationallegitimacy  provided  of course  that it improves itscapacity to deal with international problems andespecially to create an effective mechanism of collectivesecurity.Greek-Turkish relations illustrate the need for suchan improvement. The Greek Government sincerely desiresthe establishment of normal good-neighbourly relations5based on the principles of international law and respect forinternational treaties  which  however  Turkey seemsdetermined to ignore. The Turkish Parliament unanimouslyadopted a resolution on 8 June 1995  which empowers theGovernment to use military force in case Greece exercisesits legal right to extend its territorial waters in accordancewith the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.Moreover  the Turkish Government adopted the contents ofthis resolution in direct violation of the United NationsCharter  which forbids the use of force or the threat of theuse of force in international relations.Even worse  in contravention of the Treaty ofLausanne and the Treaty of Paris  Turkey laid claim at thebeginning of this year to the Imia islets in the Aegean Sea which are Greek sovereign territory  and even supportedthis claim by military means. This sets a very dangerousprecedent for the entire region. Turkey is attempting tosubvert the territorial status quo established more than 70years ago and is backing its claims with the use of armedforce. Furthermore  the Foreign Minister  Mrs. Ciller  in hercapacity as Prime Minister  claimed in February that 1 000Greek islands and islets in the Aegean are Turkish  and thatif Greece attempted to contest this “fact”  Turkey wouldconsider it a casus belli. A few days later she raised thenumber to 3 000.Greece has repeatedly called on Turkey to haverecourse to the International Court of Justice concerning theImia islets. Turkey  on the contrary  has lately challengedGreek sovereignty  even over the inhabited island ofGávdhos  south-west of Crete in the Libyan Sea  anddespite the outrageous nature of this claim  it has notunequivocally withdrawn it.We see that Turkey wilfully violates the most basicprinciples of the international legal order and far fromexhibiting any self-restraint  puts forth ever moreprovocative claims against Greece. My country  on theother hand  not only scrupulously respects international lawand treaties  but also demonstrates great self-restraint in itsrelations with Turkey. There is no better example of thisthan the fact that Greece has chosen not to react forcibly tothe massive violations of Greek airspace and the constantoverflying of Greek territory on the part of Turkishwarplanes. This responsible stance should not  however  bemisinterpreted in any way. On the contrary  and despite theabsence of any real will on the part of internationalcommunity to uphold the principles enshrined in the UnitedNations Charter  Greece is absolutely determined to protectits sovereign rights by all legitimate means  and the threatof force will not dissuade it from doing so.As to the Cyprus issue  it is widely admitted that thestatus quo is unacceptable. Nevertheless  no progress hasbeen achieved in the course of the last 22 years. Turkey provocatively defying consecutive Security Councilresolutions is still occupying by force a considerable partof the island. At the same time  Turkey is flagrantlyviolating basic human rights and freedoms of the Cypriotpeople  while engaging in systematic plunder of theisland’s cultural and religious heritage. Moreover  Turkeycontinues to systematically promote the illegal andcondemned practice of establishing settlers on the island.The time has come to reach a just and viablesolution to the Cyprus problem based on the relevantUnited Nations resolutions and providing for abicommunal bizonal federation with a single sovereigntyand international personality and a single citizenship while safeguarding the independence and territorialintegrity of the Republic of Cyprus.The prospect of Cyprus joining the European Unionis indeed an important new development  which createsconditions that should facilitate a comprehensivesettlement of the issue. The period until the start of theaccession talks should in no way be left unexploited. Atthe same time  the Greek Government welcomes any newideas and initiatives  whatever their origin may be  whichwould contribute to a solution within the framework ofthe United Nations resolutions. A basic factor forachieving a breakthrough  in our opinion  is thecoordination of all initiatives by the Secretary-Generaland his Special Representative.Meanwhile  the tension lingering on the islandinvolves serious risks and creates additional complicationswhich render the efforts for a settlement more arduous.Turkey and the pseudo-state  taking advantage of apeaceful demonstration by Greek Cypriots  proceeded afew weeks ago  with the active involvement of theextremist terrorist Turkish group the Grey Wolves  toimplement a meticulously prepared plan which wascrowned by the murder in cold blood of two youngCypriots and the injuries sustained by many others United Nations peacekeepers included.The aim was undoubtedly to demonstrate theexistence of an alleged international boundary on theisland. It was also to support the Turkish claim that thetwo communities cannot live peacefully side by side andthat the presence of the Turkish occupation forces istherefore necessary for the protection of the TurkishCypriot community. But the truth is that both6communities can indeed coexist peacefully. So it was feltnecessary to call in extremist elements from mainlandTurkey in order to implement this scenario and to try tocreate mistrust between the communities.In the wake of those recent tragic developments westeadfastly believe that the adoption of President Clerides’proposal for the demilitarization of Cyprus  a proposalwhose importance has already been widely acknowledged will decisively contribute to defusing tension and will at thesame time meet the security requirements of allcommunities living on the island.In a broader context  the search for a just and viablesolution to this complex international problem requiresdecisiveness and perseverance. If the bicommunal dialogueis to have any chance of success  a minimum commonground is indispensable  based on the relevant UnitedNations resolutions. But if the other party does not showthe necessary political will  the international communityshould at last live up to its political and moralresponsibilities. It should take action without delay and tryto convince Turkey to abide by international law andwithdraw its troops from the island.With regard to the Balkans  Greece’s policy in thearea is guided by the principles of the maintenance ofstability  peace and security  the inviolability ofinternationally recognized borders and full respect forhuman rights  including those relating to national minorities in accordance with the relevant principles of the UnitedNations and the Organization for Security and Cooperationin Europe. Greece supports the establishment of good-neighbourly relations and the development of closeeconomic ties with and among all Balkan countries. At thesame time  our systematic cooperation with the countries ofthe Balkan peninsula contributes to the achievement of theirlong-term goals of economic and political rapprochementwith the European Union and its institutions. We fullysupport and actively promote the European orientation ofthese countries.Moreover  Greece has supported all internationalinitiatives aimed at further promoting Balkan regionalcooperation  such as the conference of ministers ofsoutheastern Europe — which convened this year in Sofiaand which will meet again in Thessaloniki in June of nextyear — the European Royaumont initiative and the UnitedStates southeast European cooperative initiative. We believethat in their complementarity  these efforts contribute to thestability  security and prosperity of the area.In the context of regional cooperation I should alsomention the Greek initiative for trilateral meetings of theministers for foreign affairs of Greece  Bulgaria andRomania  which took place at Ioannina  Greece in 1995 and  after that  in Varna  Bulgaria  on 16 and 17 March1996. The aim of these meetings is to bolster subregionalcooperation  mainly in the fields of transport telecommunications and energy  as well as in thedevelopment of infrastructure.Greece was one of the founding members of theBlack Sea Economic Cooperation (BSEC) organization.Greece recently became a member of the ParliamentarianAssembly of the BSEC and participates actively in thisinitiative that encompasses countries from both theBalkans and the Black Sea area and which can make animportant contribution to the development and stability ofthe wider region. One important achievement amongothers is the establishment in Thessaloniki of the BSECBank of Trade and Development which  is expected tostart functioning soon and contribute to theimplementation of specific projects of great interest to theregion.I will now try to give a brief assessment of mycountry’s bilateral relations with each individual Balkancountry.In its relations with Albania  Greece actively pursuesthe development of good-neighbourliness and cooperationin all fields  based on the respect of sovereignty andterritorial integrity  as well as full respect for humanrights  including those relating to national minorities  inaccordance with the principles of the United Nations andthe Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.The Greek minority in Albania constitutes a bridgeof friendship and cooperation between the two countries.To this end  encouraging steps are being undertaken bythe Albanian Government. Greece has actively supportedAlbania in its efforts for reconstruction and developmentand has backed its association with internationalorganizations. The visit last March of the President of theHellenic Republic to Tirana and the signing of a treaty offriendship and cooperation between the two countriesopened a new chapter in their relations for the benefit ofthe two peoples.Greek-Bulgarian relations have continued theirfruitful and constructive development marked byexchanges of visits at all levels. Recent cruciallyimportant agreements — among them one concerning the7opening of three new border check-points and another onthe waters of the Nestos river — give true meaning to theircooperation in the field of infrastructure  while being ofdecisive significance for the future development of theregion's European orientation.Greece’s relations with Romania have reached a highlevel during the last years. Visits at all levels  including oneby the President of the Hellenic Republic  have taken placefrequently and close and broad cooperation in the economicand cultural fields has been achieved.Greece’s goal is the establishment of close andfriendly relations with all countries that have emerged fromthe former Yugoslavia. The traditionally close relations ofGreece with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia will befurther strengthened through enhanced economiccooperation  especially following the suspension of theUnited Nations embargo  which inflicted heavy losses onthe Greek economy also. A multi-faceted development oftheir cooperation will help to redress the past.Greece’s relations with Croatia and Slovenia havefollowed a steady upward trend. Greece has a great interestin the dynamic development of its relations with those twocountries in all fields  and I am glad to acknowledge theirpositive response as well. With regard to Bosnia andHerzegovina  Greece fully supported the Dayton PeaceAgreement and has actively participated in the efforts toimplement it fully. Timely and full respect of thisAgreement is the best guarantee of the preservation of theintegrity  sovereignty and multiethnic character of thatRepublic. The efforts of the international community toachieve peace in Bosnia must succeed. First must come theconstitution and proper functioning of the joint organs ofthe Republic in order to expedite the return to fullnormalization of life in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Greecehas established diplomatic relations with Bosnia andHerzegovina and participates in reconstruction plans withsubstantial economic aid.Greece expresses the wish that negotiations takingplace with The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedoniaunder the auspices of Mr. Vance on the issue of the nameof that Republic will finally meet with success  so as toopen the way for a full normalization and the dynamicdevelopment of relations between our two countries.The Middle East peace process is currently at a criticalcrossroads. It is with shock and dismay that myGovernment is following the latest dramatic developmentsin the West Bank and Gaza. We express our deepestsorrow at the deaths that have occurred and our graveconcern about the future of the peace process. Greeceurges all parties to demonstrate the utmost restraint and torefrain from any action which might lead to a furtherescalation of violence in the occupied territories. Inparticular  they must step back from any action that isbound to rekindle deep-rooted sentiments of mistrust andenmity on both sides.There is no alternative for the peoples in the regionother than a peace based on the principle of land forpeace. There is no alternative to the peace process. If thisprocess stagnates  there is a danger that it will unravel.There is an urgency for both parties to resume efforts tofulfil earnestly their agreed obligations. Greece calls onthe parties to resume negotiations immediately on thebasis of the principles already accepted by them in theMadrid and Oslo agreements. We consider it of theutmost importance that the Israeli-Palestinian InterimAgreement be fully implemented  and that the talks on thefinal status of the Palestinian territories — includingJerusalem — are speedily concluded together with thesolution of the two outstanding problems  namely security for all and social and economic development.Failure to proceed could lead to grave consequencesas far as peace and stability in the whole region areconcerned. Peoples of the region should be guaranteed asecure life within internationally recognized and safeboundaries. In this context  Greece believes that theinternational community must spare no effort to create asolid basis for the political and economic survival of thePalestinian National Authority  thereby providing a sourceof hope for the Palestinian people. Greece will continueto support this effort actively. We are of the view that thepeace process could be substantially promoted if thoseStates of the region which are directly concerned wouldjoin forces with those actively participating in it. We urgethe implementation of Security Council resolution 425(1978) on Lebanon. Greece  who has actively participatedin the Middle East peace process since its beginnings inMadrid  will continue to offer every possible support andassistance to the bilateral and multilateral negotiationstowards a comprehensive  final and just peace.The expansion and improvement of therepresentative character of the Security Councilconstitutes one of the most urgent needs for reform in theUnited Nations system. While ongoing discussions havebeen focusing on adding to the permanent membership in8order to reflect changes in the global balance since 1945  aswell as on the right of veto and its use  we should notdisregard the long-term beneficial effects of allowing morenations to participate in the decision-making process of thiscritically important body.In this context  the Greek Government has decided topresent its candidature for one of the two non-permanentseats allocated to the Group of Western European and otherStates in the Security Council for the period 1999-2000. Itshould be noted that Greece  a founding member of theUnited Nations  is one of the very few Western countriesthat have served only once as a non-permanent member ofthe Council  and that was more than 40 years ago. Greeceis located at a crossroads in the Balkans and southeasternEurope  a region that should be given the opportunity to berepresented on and to participate actively in the Council.My country’s firm and unconditional commitment to thepeaceful settlement of disputes  in accordance with thefundamental principles of international law and the Charterof the United Nations  offers all the necessary guaranteesthat its election will indeed serve the cause of internationalpeace and security.On the eve of the third millennium  an affirmation ofpeace and cohesion among peoples must  more than everbefore  constitute the primary legacy to bequeath to futuregenerations. It befits the United Nations to be thedepository and guarantor of this legacy. It rests withMember States to make solidarity  security anddevelopment their watchwords for concrete action and theirbattle cry in the fight against discord and injustice."
"68",2860,"GRD",51,1996,"﻿Virtue constitutes the greatestform of human strength. Indeed  the very origin of the word“virtue” connotes manly strength — not merely physicalstrength  but moral strength. With respect to humaninteraction  it is a widely acknowledged truth that thegreatest form of power arises when virtue is furnished withmeans. That is the concept that gave birth to the UnitedNations  inspired its noble deeds  and generally continuesto inform its operations. Accordingly  our celebration lastyear of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations wasquintessentially a collective expression of rejoicing in thewisdom embodied in that powerful truth  as well as anexplicit  joint recommitment on the part of Member nationsto act in accordance with the principle of empowerment ofvirtue  through the supply of appropriate means.In this context it is  for me  a great honour to beafforded the opportunity to address this very distinguishedgathering of the fifty-first session of the General Assembly.This event is easily the most important in the worldcalendar  as far as political deliberations are concerned.My delegation conveys to this Assembly the greetingsof the Government and the people of Grenada  andcongratulates His Excellency Mr. Razali Ismail of Malaysiaon his election to the presidency of the General Assemblyat its fifty-first session. We were particularly impressedwith the way in which Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral ofPortugal conducted the affairs of the General Assembly atits fiftieth session  and take this opportunity to thank himfor his handling of those proceedings.My delegation further expresses appreciation andthanks to the Secretary-General  His ExcellencyMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for his vision and willingnessto confront the many challenges that the Organization hasrecently been facing and  specifically for his dedication inseeking to solve world problems in the socio-economic andpolitical spheres.This new session of the General Assembly is beingheld against the background of a continually changingglobal environment. That notwithstanding  there exists  onthe one hand  a spirit of international cooperation and  onthe other  a high degree of convergence of several ideals such as the institution and strengthening of democracy promoting and fostering economic integration and politicalharmony  and the pursuit and practice of a newmultilateralism. Yet it must be expressly stated that thenoble goal of achieving global democracy  peace andprosperity can be realized only with significant inputsfrom the developed countries acting in collaboration withthe disadvantaged ones.Currently  many of the small developing countriesthat are Members of this Organization are faced withsevere economic problems. It cannot be overemphasizedthat measures aimed at stabilizing their economies andcreating the conditions for sustained growth anddevelopment have very painful effects on the populace.Nonetheless  these effects can be made more bearable and it behoves us to point specifically to the humandimension in this regard.Since June 1995  the new Administration in Grenadahas focused on strengthening our democratic institutionsand on rebuilding our economy. My Government has beendeveloping strategies  mechanisms and procedures toincrease transparency and accountability in the conduct ofGovernment. Moreover  my Government has pledgeditself to respect the fundamental rights of all citizens aswell as to other elements of civil society  such as a freepress  freedom of expression  a fair and open democraticprocess  the supremacy under God of our Constitution andthe effective functioning of the parliamentary system  forwhich our Constitution specifically and explicitlyprovides.Economically  our domestic policies are aimedprimarily at encouraging individuals and businesses tomaximize the return on their enterprise and efforts. Wehave embraced the notion that promoting micro-enterprises is one of the ways to accomplish this goal.Only recently  we initiated a micro-enterprise programme with the provision of a modest sum to help youngentrepreneurs in particular to embark upon their severalventures. We hope that the programme will succeed thereby contributing to our overall economic development both materially and psycho-culturally. Such preferentialtreatment is being given to the young so as to betterfashion a culture of confidence  thoughtful creativity andpurposeful enterprise. We are actively seeking also toenhance opportunities to enable our working populationto attain higher standards of living.My Government has set itself specific goalsincluding balanced and integrated sectoral growth  arelevant and adaptive education system  health for all  andstrategic human resource planning and development. In10this latter respect  priority is being placed on thedevelopment of an adequately skilled and disciplined workforce.While we are aware that the matter of economic andindividual personal development is first and foremost anational responsibility  we are deeply conscious that ourlimited domestic resources constitute a severe constraintupon us in our quest to fulfil this obligation.Accordingly  we earnestly ask — indeed we urge —the many United Nations agencies involved in suchactivities  and also individual Governments  to continue toprovide to us and to others in the same position the kind ofhelp that is needed to meet satisfactorily growing demandfor the spectrum of expertise vital to our nationaldevelopment.The grim realities of the very limited resources of verysmall countries are well known. Nonetheless  these realitieshave become more glaring in this era of trade liberalizationand the globalization of production.Both of these phenomena  as conceived and elaboratedby the developed countries  are startling reminders to us notonly of our condition of institutionalized non-reciprocatingdependence in a world that is becoming increasinglyinterdependent  but also of our vulnerability to economicmarginalization. Thus  we are in no way  and to no degree inhibited with regard to addressing inviting profoundreflection on the issue of the special circumstances of smallisland developing States — particularly those in theCaribbean region  where prominent among the featurescharacterizing our special circumstances is the ever-presentvulnerability to natural disaster and the widespreaddevastation resulting therefrom.The need for official development assistance and thetransfer of real resources from the North to the South hasnever been as pronounced as it is now. Indeed  such are thedimensions of that need in terms of both spread andintensity that the transfer of resources referred to here canbe effected only on the basis of a concept of a new globalorder as was initially envisaged and expressed in principleby the President of Guyana  His Excellency Dr. CheddiJagan  and adopted by all the member States of theCaribbean Community.This  no doubt  has to be elaborated  and the countriesof the North are especially requested to give disciplined andobjective consideration to this matter. The conceptualrequirements of the new global order include: areconstructive change in interaction between North andSouth; a new basis for interaction; a new ethic for relatingone to the other; and a genuine partnership  a partnershipwhich eschews exploitation of any one people by anotherand seeks instead to pursue mutual upliftment of thepeoples involved.More specifically  it is explicitly posited here thatthe developed countries should assist the less developedcountries in respect of the following: first  the alleviationof the debt burden by one means or another; secondly assistance for the development of centres for investment the training of human resources  and training in how tomake the economy more efficient  responsive andtransparent; and thirdly  technical assistance to the smallereconomies to help them make the transition towardsincorporation and effective participation in a globaleconomy that is so markedly characterized by so-calledfree trade. Smaller countries must not be excluded fromprocesses which they cannot direct in their favour or indeed  effectively influence so as to avoid experiencingthe deleterious effects of those processes. Those are buta few of the tenets upon which the proffered concept ofthe new global order is based.It is common knowledge that bananas provide alivelihood for a significant percentage of the people of theCaribbean  and particularly the subregion of theOrganization of Eastern Caribbean States. Thus  thecurrent challenge to our special arrangements for that fruitin Europe is  to say the least  uncaring  if not hostile.Grenada and several of the other States now being soaffected have  on many issues  collaborated with andsupported those very countries that are now quiteunrelenting in their deliberate assault upon ourpreferential arrangement  which constitutes an assault onthe well-being and the very livelihood of a significantproportion of our people.There should be no need whatsoever to remind theAssembly that there is a direct correlation between thepremature destruction of our banana industry and thewell-being and integrity of our democratic process andthus of our democracy itself. Substantial increases incrime and other social ills have been shown to inducecommensurate increases in involvement in trading in  andthe use of  illicit drugs. We certainly prefer to prevent theoccurrence of such situations than to have to expend ourenergies and scarce resources on remedial action tocontain and eradicate the now ever-present threat of anexpanding narco-culture.It cannot be denied that  there are other  and moreimportant  objectives to be achieved besides protecting themarket economy. And this applies to all countries  thedeveloped as well as the less developed. The time is nowright for serious thrusts to be made towards the alleviationof the poverty and deprivation which are so widespreadacross the world  although most prevalent in the developingcountries. This process must be activated immediately toensure that economic progress is buttressed by socialequity. Freedom from want; good health; genuineeducation; a clean environment; elimination of the scourgeof illicit drugs  as well as of unemployment andunderemployment; and the better and wider enjoyment ofbasic human rights: these are the goals we shouldunswervingly and constantly be seeking to reach.In this context  my Government is cognizant of itsduties and responsibilities. We are convinced that throughprudent management of our very limited resources  awillingness on the part of our people to work hard and  onour part  clear political leadership and virtuously inspiredguidance — all enhanced by the support of friendlyGovernments and donor agencies — we shall  in duecourse  place our country on a sound path towards genuinegrowth.My delegation is happy to state in this regard thatsome improvement has already been made and that ourGovernment looks forward to achieving in the not toodistant future most of the goals we have set ourselves inorder more effectively to pursue those other goals  whichwould significantly enhance the quality of our people’slives.In the context of collective international effortstowards the achievement of some kind of sustainabledevelopment in the less developed countries  it is instructiveto refer to the recently held Group of Seven summit inLyon  France  where most of the efforts focused on the newglobal order.The leaders of the world’s most powerful nationsagreed that in the present global economic situation it isabsolutely necessary to control negative consequences andfight against the risks of exclusion  both at the national andinternational levels. Their communiqué  entitled“Globalization for the Benefit of All”  does seem to signalthe stirrings of a new order for humankind.Grenada welcomes the discussion held on aid fordevelopment — particularly with officials from theInternational Monetary Fund and the World Bank — and isheartened by the fact that in those discussions modalitieswere defined for a new partnership for development basedon the sharing of responsibilities between developedcountries  developing countries and multilateralorganizations.The pledge by the G-7 countries to ensuresubstantial flows of public aid for development to thecountries most in need is very timely and most welcome.Dare we of the South perceive this pronouncement by theG-7 to be not simply a pledge of honour but  further  anexpression of subscription to the new global order  asenunciated by a visionary of the South  underscored nowby a soulful shinning forth of virtue on the part of theNorth? My delegation sincerely hopes so.It is several years since any substantial change wasmade to the structure of one of the most important organsof this Organization. I refer to the Security Council.Meanwhile  the international political and economicenvironments have undergone some drastic and far-reaching transformations. Grenada strongly believes thatin order to reflect the new geopolitical and economicrealities of our world today  there are changes that arenow due  particularly in the Security Council.Accordingly  my delegation expresses its unwaveringsupport for the reforms currently being undertaken  aswell as those now being contemplated with respect to theUnited Nations system.In July of this year  the European Union  through itsParliament  adopted a resolution to support the call forparticipation in international organizations by the Republicof China. The Government and people of Grenadaconsider this action on the part of the European Union tohave been a most significant development. We welcomethis development  and we applaud the European Union forit. Indeed  we are encouraged by that action  for thepersistent plea of Grenada  constantly repeated overseveral years in every appropriate forum  has now beenamplified into a clarion call for moral justice  in contrastto the expediency of power politics  economic advantageand legislative manipulation of yesteryear.The Republic of China has for many yearsconsistently displayed its commitment to the values andprinciples of this body. Indeed  in the face of threats andundisguised acts of aggression  the courageous people ofthe Republic of China boldly chose to embark upon apath of freedom  justice  and respect for human rights and recently took part in their presidential election  whichwas open  free and fair.12The economic achievements of this brave country of21.3 million people are well and widely known. Thus  therecan be no doubt as to the capability of the people of theRepublic of China to make substantial contributions to thework of the United Nations. As to their willingness to makesignificant contributions  that also cannot be a matter ofdoubt. They have given testimony in this regard in severalways. They have established their good faith. They deservethe right to participate in the conferences and activities ofthe United Nations system. To continue to deny them thisright would be to persist in denying them justice within theconfraternity of nations.Superior power is found only where there is superiorexcellence of some kind  and the Republic of China hasmanifested a certain degree of superior power whichderives from virtue rather than from physical strength.Thus  the Government and people of Grenada unequivocallyexhort this Assembly to secure participation by theRepublic of China in the agencies and activities of theUnited nations system.With every passing year  contemporary politicsbecomes more complex and  thus  commensurately complexare the related solutions. In this regard  my delegationespecially applauds the efforts of the United Nations inattempting to maintain some degree of peace and securityin various parts of the world. From Haiti to the war-tornRepublics of the former Yugoslavia  to the famine-strickencities of many an African State  the United Nationshumanitarian activities and missions of peace are indeedworthy of special commendation. In this regard  I seize theopportunity now afforded me to express a father’sappreciation of and blessings upon my son Mark  who forsome years has been and continues to be so engaged  andI ask your indulgence in this regard.Grenada is encouraged by the progress — albeithalting — made in the Middle East peace process and urgescontinued dialogue until the noble ideal of peacefulcoexistence is achieved. But world peace and security willnot be attained if those countries with nuclear capabilitiescontinue to promulgate their use for military purposes. Mydelegation therefore welcomes efforts to institute acomprehensive ban on nuclear testing.Similarly  the practice of transporting hazardousradioactive materials  particularly through the CaribbeanSea  must be stopped immediately. The verysurreptitiousness with which this business is conducted andtransportation effected is indeed a tacit admission ofwrongdoing. Caribbean humanness is violated in suchtransactions. In the name of humanity  therefore  theGovernment and the people of Grenada  withoutequivocation and without qualification  call for thispractice to be stopped  and stopped now.It has been suggested by Max Ascoli that“civilization is a constant quest for non-violentmeans of solving conflicts — a common quest forpeace.”Nonetheless  my Government perceives civilization asbeing more than simply a quest for peace  more thanmerely the shunning of visible violence. My Governmentsees civilization as the purposeful pursuit of peacethrough commitment to justice; the inherent equality of allmen and women; and the inalienable rights which derivefrom simply being human. My Government subscribes tothe principle of the overriding rule of moral law.In the context of violations of humanness  it behovesme to express  on behalf of my delegation  the deepconcern of the Government and the people of Grenada inrespect of the agonies which are currently beingexperienced by a significant number of persons in Cyprus.Grenada  like Cyprus  is an island nation  small  butsovereign. We therefore call for an end to the suffering towhich so many of the families and individual persons ofthat beautiful country have been subjected. The smallnessof a nation does not  to any degree whatever  negate thefundamental human rights of each of its citizens.The great Lebanese poet Khalil Gibran  in hisThoughts and Meditations  offered humanity the followinginsightful observation:“My soul preached to me and showed me thatI am neither more than the pygmy  nor less than thegiant. Ere my soul preached to me  I looked uponhumanity as two men; one weak  whom I pitied  andthe other strong  whom I followed or resisted indefiance. But now I have learned that I am as bothare  and made from the same elements. My origin istheir origin  my conscience is their conscience  mycontention is their contention  and my pilgrimage istheir pilgrimage.”My delegation is deeply convinced of theunsurpassable wisdom which these words of KhalilGibran represent. The sentiment conveyed constitutes thesine qua non for the realization of internationalbrotherhood. This we do believe.13Accordingly  my delegation earnestly urges thathenceforth the quintessential sameness of all mankind anda genuine commitment to virtue should be adopted as theguiding principles of this Assembly. May God blesseveryone participating in this fifty-first regular session ofthe Assembly  so that  so much the more effectively  theAssembly will be a transforming blessing to our world."
"69",2907,"GTM",51,1996,"﻿Allow me to congratulate you  Mr. President  onyour well-deserved election to preside over the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-first regular session. I also wish toconvey our appreciation to Ambassador Diogo Freitas doAmaral for the skill and efficiency with which he conductedthe work of the General Assembly in the course of its lastregular session.We are very close to the achievement of peace in mycountry. This can already be felt in the silence of the gunsand the newly flourishing spirit of unity among brothers.Intolerance is giving way to awareness of the commonchallenges we face. We now realize that  for example  if weare to combat corruption and impunity  we need to sharevalues and principles  though not necessarily ideologies.United in diversity  we must discover our ownmeans for building our future. Our country is healing itsdeep wounds and revealing its true face  as a generousland that is the home to age-old cultures. Guatemala iscoming to terms with itself and  in so doing  isreconciling itself with the world.We are once again speaking as a friendly nationamong friendly nations. The peace process has enabled usto evolve our own agenda  which responds to the needsof our country without our having had to accept anagenda imposed by anyone else. To that end we havereceived the constant support of the internationalcommunity  and in particular of the United Nationssystem.Today  at a time when the reform of the system isthe subject of such intense discussion  our nationalexperience may perhaps be useful  as it is an example ofcooperation that is at once respectful and dynamic  basedfundamentally on internal efforts with appropriate externalhelp. For us this approach is indispensable since  to alarge extent  it has been possible to build peace  thanks tothe valuable and diverse forms of support received fromagencies of the United Nations system.But this has not been effected through themechanical application of preconceived formulas  or ofautomatic institutional moulds. On the contrary  what wehave here is a challenging and complex empiricallaboratory where all of us are learning step by step. It is in fact  a constant exercise in discovery with living socialtissues  an exercise in which we have all had to pool ourbest efforts. The creativity of individuals  Governments and various organizations — private and public  local andnational  regional and multilateral — has come togetherto produce a constant quest for the solutions we need. Ithas been an exercise in international solidarity that complementing internal endeavours  has made it possiblefor us to forge ahead along the right path to recovery.But the test tube is the life of our people  and forthat reason there is little margin for error. Errors increasethe suffering of my people. And Guatemala has sufferedgreatly from authoritarian intervention and the impositionof alien patterns that once impaired a political and socialmaturation process that sought to infuse its own life-giving fluids with contemporary ideas of equity anddemocracy. Domestic injustices and imbalances wereaggravated by the tensions of the cold war that explodedwithin my country.3Now is the time for reconciliation. Now is the timeonce again to take development in hand. Now is the timeto search for effective formulas to link our villages with theWorld Trade Organization; to link the poverty afflicting thefamilies of our neighbourhoods with international financialinstitutions; and to link decisions independently taken at thelevel of our domestic communities with the largedevelopment agencies.We are on the threshold of signing the peace. We lookforward to this historic transition with hope and jubilation and we foresee the complex stage of strengthening thefabric of society and production. From that stage we canlook hopefully to the future. Peace will come to Guatemalabecause we Guatemalans have striven for it and because theinternational community has helped us along the way.As is well known  last week in Mexico City theparties signed the agreement on the last substantive item ofthe agenda agreed upon in the peace talks  the oneconcerning the strengthening of civilian power and the roleof the army in a democratic society. We now have to dealwith the operational issues: demobilization  reinsertion intocivil society  the cease-fire and the timetable for theimplementation of the agreements. In the course of this yearwe shall initial  God willing  the final agreement for a firmand lasting peace  which will put an end to an armedconflict that has lasted 36 years.It is worth emphasizing then  that for the last fivemonths there has been no armed confrontation  which hasallowed the peace talks to progress without subjecting ournegotiators to the anguish and pressure of knowing that asthey are working Guatemalan blood is being shed. That isover. Far from deadening or delaying the dialogue  thisstate of affairs has stimulated it  given the prospect of adefinitive cessation of hostilities. This has also stimulatedus to see clearly where we are going and to gain a moreprofound understanding of what has happened.As many of the representatives in this Assemblyknow  the internal conflict caused great misfortune andsuffering for our people. I am referring primarily to theirreparable loss of thousands of lives. I also have in mindthe traumatic aftermath of the conflict  which is evident inthe faces of every cripple  orphan and widow  and in everysurviving family  a number of which were eye-witnesses tothe tragedies. I am also referring to the economic losses  inthe form of damage to infrastructure and lost opportunitiesfor productive development.I also wish to call to mind the set-backs caused bythe conflict. Let us recall the words of the singer-songwriter who asked “Who will return to us the fatherland that could havebeen?”While more difficult to pinpoint  and perhaps impossibleto measure  these too are irreparable losses: all that wecould have done  but did not do; all the growth that couldhave occurred  but did not occur; all we could have built but did not build.While others were progressing  we were stagnating locked in a cruel domestic struggle that included elementsimported from the cold war  which arbitrarily kept incheck for 40 years our political  social and economicevolution. While technological  commercial and politicalchanges were taking place in the rest of the world  andnations were discovering new opportunities in theirrelations  we were plunged deeper into the violence of adomestic conflict that took the lives of thousands andthousands of young people  who were unable to providetheir country with the fruits of their talents andendeavours. While new international options for well-being were blossoming elsewhere  we continued to beconsumed internally by a dirty war that crushed entirevillages and compelled many people to flee.There is a part of our country that never came intobeing  because Guatemalans were bogged down infratricidal domestic struggle that we were not able to stopin time — an internal conflict that — it is true — wasfuelled by our own injustice  but — it must beacknowledged — was also fanned from abroad. But suchis history: hope springs up amid tragedy  and lessons aredrawn from mistakes. Our people has an extraordinarycapacity for recovery and learning.We are nearing the end of this stage  and anotherhas already begun: one in which all of us — absolutelyall — are responsible and committed. One of theconsequences of this deeply traumatic and protractedconflict is that never before have we found ourselves ina situation so propitious for dialogue and reconciliation.Never before have we shared such a profound and keenawareness of our immense multi-ethnic  multilingual andmulticultural wealth  or of our environment  which isextraordinarily varied. Never before have we been sokeenly aware of our need for internal integration and forthe development of our own potential.4We have within our grasp a unique opportunity  onethat will never recur  to transform this moment into amoment for the future and for renovation. This is perhapsnot the appropriate occasion for detailing all the progressmade in recent months. Such details may be found in thevarious reports of United Nations Mission for theVerification of Human Rights and of Compliance with theCommitments of the Comprehensive Agreement on HumanRights in Guatemala (MINUGUA) and other agencies ofthe United Nations system. But it is worthwhile to stressthe enormous effort that has gone into fulfilling theagreements already signed  even before most of them havecome into force. In particular  we have had remarkablesuccesses in the field of human rights  as has beenrecognized by various commissions and subcommissionsdealing with the issue.At this singular moment at the end of the century when we are celebrating the International Decade of theWorld’s Indigenous People  it is fitting to point out thatGuatemala has recently ratified and deposited InternationalLabour Organization Convention 169  the Indigenous andTribal Peoples Convention  which strengthens the rule oflaw in Guatemala by conferring benefits and guarantees onthe Mayan population with regard to property  conditions ofemployment  training for professions  crafts and ruralindustries  health  social security  education  theadministration of justice  the environment and the properand rational use of natural resources.We are very close to the signature of an Agreement ona Firm and Lasting Peace. We now face the hardest part ofour task  but also the most challenging part  replete withpossibilities: that of creating peace  of building peace. Wewould do well  therefore  to recall two fundamental points:first  the peace that we are striving to build has a specificorientation; and  secondly  peace is not made only by thosewho sign the agreements.We seek a peace that is well oriented. We should notbe content with a precarious peace  or with politicalaccommodations made for the occasion  with no sense ofdirection or permanence. The accords signed so far  andthose that are to follow  express basic agreements that taken as a whole  constitute a specific agenda aimed atdeepening democracy and furthering development.Furthermore  peace is not made only by those whosign the agreements. Peace is made on a day-to-day basis by the entire population  which takes seriously the need forreconciliation and realizes optimistically that it is possibleto have fair opportunities to work  educate oneself  beproductive and improve one’s situation.Peace is built by men and women of flesh andblood  with their differences  passions  interests andenmities. Peace is built day by day  in villages  hamlets neighbourhoods and communities. Peace is built throughordinary coexistence  with all Guatemalans  male orfemale  striving daily to make a living and to help theirfamilies get ahead  seeking out better opportunities whileenduring hardships in a country with so many limitationsand so much distrust. That is where reconciliation musttake place and where we must identify the true enemiesof peace: poverty  discrimination  exclusion andintolerance.We live in a spirit of solidarity within a fragileshared space. Our mission is to care for it and improve itas a legacy for coming generations. That space  thatpossibility  does not belong to us; it is but a legacy ofwhat former generations did or failed to do. Solidarity isnot limited to those who stand before us; there is a kindof solidarity that embraces even those who have not yetbeen born. What can we do to ensure that this solidarityaccepts life as a primary  elementary and basic value when we have lived for so long immersed in violence?We will attain development when we becomecapable of providing comprehensive security for allGuatemalans. The assurance that our children will not diebecause of negligence or lack of medical attention  thesecurity of a stable job  plans and facilities for theacquisition of housing  security of access to a competitiveeducational system allowing us to learn and to teach ourchildren  the security of ample nutrition  security for ourpossessions and for our lives  access to and equaltreatment under impartial and timely systems of justice —these are the key aspects of comprehensive security.In this regard  Central America has taken importantdecisions to renew its agendas under the Alliance forSustainable Development  which it is taking decisive stepsto implement  including through the Treaty on DemocraticSecurity signed by the Presidents of the isthmus at SanPedro Sula in December 1995. That broad set ofcommitments prepares Central Americans to wage acomprehensive fight against trafficking in drugs and inhuman beings.There can be no stable democracy over the longterm if there are extreme inequalities in the distribution ofwealth and of social opportunities. Democratic citizenship5poses the question of how we are to incorporate those whoare unlikely to have access to public institutions; those who because of poverty or discrimination  cannot invoke theirrights or have them recognized. No democracy is possiblewhen a significant percentage of the population is living inextreme poverty. Our democracy must generate economicconditions that permit the satisfaction of the basic needs ofthe population.The greatest challenge and the greatest opportunity forGuatemala resides in organized  realistic and coherentimplementation of the commitments derived from theagreements undertaken. That is why we must understandthem as a starting point that opens up a new page ofchallenges and efforts for all the population.For its part  the Government has taken on some verydaring and far-reaching commitments that encompassalmost all its institutions. They imply major legal reformsand major budgetary efforts. These commitments havemade it possible to reach the agreements  and stability andthe strengthening of peace and stability depend upon theirfulfilment.But to do all of this  we also need the understandingand firm support of the international community. We needa real opening of markets and fair prices for our products as well as foreign investment to add to the internal savingsachieved through the generation of jobs and the stableimprovement of our productive capacity. We also need thecomplement of technical and financial cooperation  aboveall during the stage immediately following the signing ofthe peace.For all of these reasons  Guatemala appreciates thesupport and recognition of the international community. Forthose same reasons  Guatemala also aspires to contribute to the extent of its modest possibilities  to strengthening themultilateral system and respectful understanding amongnations.Guatemala attaches great importance to the principleof universality that must characterize the United Nations and this leads us to express our conviction that the Republicof China on Taiwan must also be fully represented in ourOrganization and must actively participate in the search forsolutions in this new global  interdependent world. In ouropinion  and taking into account earlier positiveexperiences  this in no way contradicts any effort atreunification.It is often said that we are living in a time ofchange. But it is much more than that: this is a change oftimes. We are living just on the bridge between twodifferent eras of world history  where we cannot yet makeout the difference between what is ending and what isbeginning. There is an order that has gone into crisis  butthere is a new order that cannot yet be clearly perceived.All institutions are being put to the test.We view with appreciation and hope the fact thatthis interaction between Guatemala’s experience and therespectful participation of Governments and multilateralinstitutions is yielding modest but valid solutions enabling us to envisage a simple  competent and lessbureaucratic form of institutional structures  and a kind ofcooperation that does not undermine the precarious livingconditions of the poor majorities in our countries and thatcontributes ideas and technical skills with due respect forour population. Guatemala is becoming a laboratory forcooperation with respect  of partnership rather thanimposition.It is also becoming a broad and open horizon fordiscovery  an opportunity to search for ways toencompass the aspirations  proposals and initiatives of somany people from inside and from abroad  and above all to go on creating spaces for self-expression by the peopleand the communities of my country  which  with suchcourage  endurance  valour and desire  have notsuccumbed to adversity.I wish to attest to the gratitude of my people and myGovernment to the Secretary-General and to all theofficials who in various capacities have contributed toadvancing the peace negotiations in my country  as wellas to making a reality of the various complex efforts atdevelopment that we are undertaking. We wish especiallyto thank the Moderator appointed by the Secretary-General for the negotiations between the Government ofGuatemala and the Unidad Revolucionaria NacionalGuatemalteca (URNG)  the small but efficient GuatemalaUnit of the Secretariat and all the members of the UnitedNations Mission for the Verification of Human Rights andof Compliance with the Commitments of theComprehensive Agreement on Human Rights inGuatemala (MINUGUA)  as well as the other Secretariatofficials who  in one way or another  directly orindirectly  have contributed to the success of the peaceprocess.Our deep gratitude goes also to the six countries thatconstitute the Group of Friends of the peace process 6which have worked so doggedly for that long-soughtgoal — Colombia  Mexico  Norway  Spain  the UnitedStates of America and Venezuela.We wish also to express our appreciation to otherGovernments that  without being a formal part of thisGroup  have substantially contributed to the advancement ofour reconciliation and development. Many thanks to allthose persons of good will  committed to peace in mycountry."
"70",2950,"GUY",51,1996,"﻿As the United Nations facesthe beginning of its second half-century and the dawn ofa new millennium  we look to the Organization for thecontinuing fulfilment of the high purposes of its Charter:the maintenance of international peace and security andthe achievement of international cooperation in solvingproblems of an economic  social  cultural or humanitariancharacter.The experience of the past 50 years has shown thatthese goals are not easily attained. The end of the coldwar has not meant an end to conflicts. The world has nowentered a new era in which civil strife has replaced super-power rivalry as the main threat to peace and security.7We have yet to find workable solutions to many situationsin which conflict continues to prevail. At the same time  thevast majority of mankind remains prey to poverty  hungerand disease. Such inhumane conditions serve as a fertilebreeding ground for chronic economic and socialdegradation.You  Mr. President  face the enormous task of guidingus through this vast thicket of concerns. We are confident however  that your well-known diplomatic experience andskills will lead us to new paths in the search for satisfactorysolutions. As a son of Malaysia  a country which has longchampioned the cause of peace and development  you willundoubtedly bring to bear a sense of urgency to thedischarge of the many responsibilities with which you willbe entrusted.In so doing  you will build upon the efforts of yourpredecessor  Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral of Portugal  whospearheaded our thrust to reform and restructure the worldOrganization in order to make it more responsive to ourneeds in the post-cold-war era. He is deserving of ourgratitude for his labour during the past year.I would also like to pay tribute to the Secretary-General for providing dynamic leadership to the Secretariatin these challenging times.The special commemorative meeting held last year tomark our Organization’s fiftieth anniversary provided anexcellent opportunity not only for reflection on its pastachievements  but also on its future direction. There was nodearth of ideas and proposals for strengthening the UnitedNations in order to help it face the challenges of thetwenty-first century. It may be useful for us to look closerat some of those suggestions to determine their feasibilityfor implementation. It is an exercise in which some of ourmain Committees  our several working groups and theSecretariat may profitably engage so that the thinking ofour Heads of State and Governments does not fall by thewayside  unheeded and forgotten.My own President  on that historic occasion  presentedhis concept of a new global human order in which thenations of the world could come together in a creativepartnership for progress. This concept of partnership ispredicated on the belief that we all now live in aninterdependent world  in which  unless we learn to hangtogether  we will certainly hang separately.No one nation  no matter how militarily andeconomically powerful  can hope adequately to address themany complex cross-boundary problems which it nowfaces. States Members of the United Nations need tocome together urgently to see how they can enhancecooperation in the various areas specified by the UnitedNations Charter.Among the immediate imperatives would be thecreation of a partnership for peace  for  although theworld has been mercifully spared another world war since1945  it has witnessed a number of conflicts  both old andnew  which continue to proliferate and to sap ourcollective strength. The causes of these eruptions areoften deep-seated and not easily eradicated. They requirecareful study and attempts at resolution. Invariably  thiswill mean that the United Nations will have to go beyondtraditional peacemaking and peacekeeping to the increasedpractice of preventive diplomacy aimed at pacifyingpotential conflict situations. The experience of pastoperations  both successes and failures  should be distilledwith a view to garnering those lessons which may be ofguidance in future cases. In this context  classicalapproaches to conflict resolution may have to besupplemented by new and imaginative ideas.Over the past few years  we have together made alaudable effort to enhance the Security Council’s capacityto deal with threats to international peace and security. Toour credit  we have been somewhat successful in makingthe Council’s operations more transparent to the publiceye. We have yet to decide  however  on the majoraspects of resolution 48/26 on the question of equitablerepresentation on and increase in the membership of theSecurity Council.Ideas abound on ways and means of achieving theseaims. Our challenge is to reconcile these so that aconsensus can be reached on reform. My delegationbelieves that the various proposals now on the table  suchas those made by Belize  Italy and Malaysia  need to befurther examined to determine both their politicalacceptability and feasibility. It is possible that  under theright circumstances and with the necessary political will a reformed and more representative Council will emerge.A more democratic Security Council will commandthe respect and enjoy the confidence of United NationsMember States. In time  they may be persuaded to relyless on their own costly defence forces and more on thecollective security system provided by the Organization.As specified by the Charter  the various organs and8agencies such as the Assembly  the Council itself  theInternational Court of Justice  the Secretariat and — underChapter VIII — regional arrangements  can combine toform an effective bulwark against breaches of peace.During the cold war  some of these organs were precludedfrom performing their several functions. We must now seekto endow them with the machinery needed for their fulloperation.At the same time  we need to strengthen thepartnership against the proliferation of all lethal weapons nuclear and conventional alike. Following the indefiniteextension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of NuclearWeapons  we have the opportunity now to sign theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty which  whileadmittedly less than satisfactory  nevertheless offers achance to proscribe the further development of dangerousweapons.Although considered less worrisome than their nuclearcounterparts  conventional weapons are no less destructiveof human life and property. With the ending of the East-West arms race  these weapons are being diverted byproducer States to developing countries  where they fueltensions and eventual conflict. These dangerous transfersmust be closely monitored and a serious attempt made toconvert the arms industry to development purposes. It istime that we see a dividend from our investment in peace.In eschewing the use of arms  we must seek topromote dialogue  negotiation and development to removethe root causes of all disputes and conflicts. The persistenteruption of violence in the Middle East demonstrates that unless respect is shown for the fundamental rights of thePalestinian people  peace will continue to elude thattroubled region. The peace process cannot  therefore  beallowed to die since without it there is little prospect ofreconciliation among belligerents. Similarly  in the Koreanpeninsula and  indeed  in all areas where divisions amongpeoples exist  we must use our best diplomatic and politicalefforts to reduce tensions and encourage peacefulreunification.Our security concerns have widened in the post-cold-war era to other areas  such as the environment and drug-trafficking. As a small State and member of theCommission on Sustainable Development  Guyana looksforward to the review of the United Nations Conference onEnvironment and Development  which is due to take placein 1997. That meeting will provide us with an opportunityto assess the progress made towards implementing thecommitments assumed both at Rio and Bridgetown.With regard to our efforts to combat drug-traffickingand abuse  we were pleased to participate in the high-level debate in the Economic and Social Council lastJune. We urge further international action on themeasures agreed upon and also on the early establishmentof an international criminal court which  in our view  willserve as an effective deterrent to drug-related crimes andto other violations against humanity.Having participated in the various summitconferences which have been held on the environmentand development  population and development  humansettlements  women and children and social development my Government is also anxious to see these agreementsfully implemented. We also look to the upcoming WorldFood Summit in Rome to build upon these existingcommitments. Eliminating hunger and guaranteeing foodsecurity to all the world’s people are urgent imperativesfor the international community.As a country which has suffered from the deleteriouseffects of colonialism  Guyana stands in solidarity with allStates that now face the formidable challenge ofdevelopment. We were thus pleased to participate in therecent mid-term review of the implementation of theUnited Nations New Agenda for the Development ofAfrica in the 1990s. The results of that review gavereasons to hope that the African predicament can beovercome through a much-strengthened cooperationbetween African countries and the internationalcommunity. We wish at this time to call on all States tointensify their efforts to support Africa’s initiatives topromote its development  for the success or failure of theAfrican Agenda will be the success or failure of us all.These issues are at the heart of the wider andcomprehensive Agenda for Development which we are inthe process of elaborating. The endeavour we have madethis past year to complete our negotiations on the contentof this important document  while significant  points tothe inevitable conclusion that we have yet to find thelevel of political will needed for meaningful agreement.We seem to be stuck in the confrontational mode setduring our previous years of dialogue. My delegation isnonetheless of the view that  given the growinginterdependence of Member States and the globalizationof the world economy and society generally  there arenow sufficient elements to form the basis of a globalpartnership for peace and development.The terms of this partnership could be drawn up bymutual agreement of the parties  specifying both the9obligations and the rights of each side. On the part of thedeveloping countries  there would be acceptance of theirprimary responsibility for their development as well as theneed for good governance. The developed nations  on theother hand  would commit themselves to supporting theseendogenous efforts and to assisting in the creation of aninternational economic environment that would bepropitious to success.Like the Lomé partnership that has existed for sometime now between a large group of African  Caribbean andPacific States and countries of the European Union  such anarrangement would provide a fair degree of predictability inits operations. Developed and developing countries alikewould have the assurances of joint performance andcommon benefit. Eventually  this partnership would formthe basis of a new and enlightened world order to which wehave all aspired for many years.My President  Mr. Cheddi Jagan and the Governmentand people of Guyana are dedicated to the creation of thisnew global partnership. We were pleased to note thatseveral international conferences — including the ninthsession of the United Nations Conference on Trade andDevelopment at Midrand  South Africa  and the meeting ofthe Group of Seven in Lyon  France — have fullysubscribed to the concept. We are therefore encouraged tothink that the time has come for the establishment of a newglobal human order that would be based on respect fornational sovereignty  participatory democracy  socio-economic equality  people-centred development and therealization of the economic  social and cultural rightsenshrined in the United Nations Charter. We know thatsuch an order or partnership — call it what you will — willnot be easy to create and will require the adoption of afundamentally new development paradigm which will bringtogether all actors  governmental and non-governmentalalike  as well as multilateral and regional institutions  towork together for economic and social progress.At a symposium which was hosted in August 1996 bythe Government of Guyana  ample consideration was givento ways and means of promoting this new order. In light ofthe changed political  economic and social circumstances ofthe world today  the conference agreed inter alia  that  sincethe enormous debt burden continued to inhibit development serious consideration should be given to the cancellation ofthe debt of the least developed countries; a significantreduction in multilateral debt; and a reduction of theremaining debt stock to sustainable levels for the otherdeveloping countries  with debt-service payments limited to10 per cent of exports  provided that 50 per cent of thesavings are used for social sector development. Thereshould also be a significant increase in transfers of long-term development finance to developing countries by first  attaining the existing official development assistancetarget of 0.7 per cent of gross national product bymobilizing new and additional sources of finance;secondly  creating a global fund by mobilizing resourcesusing new and innovative measures  such as the Tobin taxand environment-related levies from which Governmentsin both the North and the South would benefit; and thirdly  introducing measures to stabilize the internationalmonetary system and financial markets.In our efforts to promote the concept of the newglobal human order  we believe that serious considerationshould also be given to the establishment of a fair andequitable trading system  including the provision ofreliable access to the markets of the North. Such a systemshould take into account the special needs of smalldeveloping States; ensure fair and stable commodityprices; secure a renegotiation of the provisions of theWorld Trade Organization  especially with respect to tradeand environment  intellectual property rights and foreigndirect investments; a reduction and relaxation ofconditions attached to future financial transfers; a newemphasis on the expansion of production and growth forsustainable development and a safe physical environmentin the south; the development of the social sector as afocus of any new programme with emphasis on education human resources  health and the development needs ofwomen  children and indigenous peoples; and theenhancement of efforts to democratize and strengthen theUnited Nations and to restructure other multilateralfinancial institutions to respond more effectively to thechallenge of people-centred development.In this regard  we must quickly resolve the financialcrisis in which the Organization finds itself. MemberStates  particularly the developed countries  must honourtheir payment obligations so that the funding of all UnitedNations activities may be placed on a sound andpredictable basis.These are some of the measures which myGovernment believes need to be taken urgently by theinternational community in order to promote global peaceand security. Admittedly  some  if not all  may seem inthe eyes of many to be too bold and far- reaching. Yet  ifthey are not implemented soon  we run the grave risk ofjeopardizing the future of generations to come. We havethe moral imperative to act swiftly to prevent the furtherdecline of our peoples and  indeed  of our entire10civilization. Let us therefore resolve to make this fifty-firstsession of the General Assembly a decisive turning point inthe life of the Organization and an opportunity for forginga just and enlightened partnership among the peoples of theworld."
"71",2996,"HND",51,1996,"﻿Once again the United Nations GeneralAssembly is meeting to take stock of the global situationand of the role that the Organization plays in that context.I am confident that the experience  talent and diplomaticskills of our President  His Excellency Mr. Razali Ismail will play a decisive role in this complex undertaking. Iwish him every success in his sensitive work.I wish also to express my delegation’s gratitude forthe excellent job done by Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral Minister for Foreign Affairs of Portugal  in the course of17the last General Assembly session  which commemoratedthe fiftieth anniversary of the founding of this Organization.My country has been observing very closely theadministrative activities of Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali in hiscapacity as Secretary-General  and we feel bound to expressour recognition of the poise with which he has guided theUnited Nations during these difficult times for theOrganization and for the whole world. His undeniablequalities of statesmanship have averted crises  and hisstrength of character has succeeded in upholding the idealson which this Organization is founded. I wish to convey tohim  on my own behalf and on behalf of my Government my sincere respect and admiration.Honduras reiterates its conviction that internationalconflicts must be settled by peaceful and diplomatic means.For this reason  we recognize the importance and value ofthe 1995 Dayton peace agreement  the 1996 Parisagreements and the subsequent international agreements andcommitments for which the international communityprepared the way. These have led to a cessation ofhostilities  the resumption of political talks  internationalrecognition between Belgrade and Zagreb  and theestablishment of relations between the Federal Republic ofYugoslavia and The former Yugoslav Republic ofMacedonia.In the Americas  Haiti is an example of the results thatcan be achieved through concerted action and political willon the part of the international community in establishing through the United Nations  operations designed to achieve maintain and consolidate peace. My country wishes toexpress its satisfaction at having taken part in thoseoperations  as well as in those carried out in WesternSahara.In the same vein  we cannot overlook the problems ofthe subregion. Honduras has always viewed with concernthe problems besetting its sister republics in CentralAmerica. For this reason  we acknowledge and support allefforts in this regard  in particular the agreements reachedbetween the Government of Guatemala and the URNG.At the forty-ninth session of the General Assembly my country secured unanimous support in this body tooccupy a seat in the Security Council as a non-permanentmember. We believe that we have fully lived up to the trustvested in us  since we have worked in the Council in strictadherence to the principles and norms of international lawenshrined in the United Nations Charter and in keepingwith the foreign policy pursued by the President of theRepublic  Mr. Carlos Roberto Reina.Throughout our first term of presidency of theCouncil  in July last year  we succeeded in maintainingthe necessary equanimity and balance to steer the workand the debates on the various issues brought before thepresidency of the Council. These included humanitarianoperations in Bosnia and Herzegovina  Rwanda andBurundi  as well as peace operations in Haiti  Angola andLiberia.Tomorrow we will assume the presidency of theSecurity Council for the second time  and we shall workin the same spirit of cooperation and with genuine resolveto help bring about solutions to problems that arise in thearea of international peace and security.Central America has now returned to the worldscene with a new  integrational approach that promotesjoint action and allows it to speed up its developmentprocess. Our approach  grounded in history  tradition solidarity and  above all  our awareness of a shareddestiny  has made it possible for us to pool our efforts inseeking to achieve a higher level of economicdevelopment in all areas.In the framework of the integration process in oursubregion  since 1986 we have held a series ofpresidential summits  the first six of which were highlypolitical in nature  fulfilling the purpose of securing peaceand democratization in the region. The following ones focusing on economic topics  led to the formation of theCentral American Integration System (SICA) and definedour current agenda: alliance for sustainable development.I would like to take this opportunity to thank thisAssembly for the support it gave our System last year bygranting it the status of observer  which will make itpossible to achieve greater cooperation between theUnited Nations System and the Central AmericanIntegration System.As we stand on the threshold of a new millennium my Government is strongly committed to theresponsibilities imposed by the world around us. In thisrespect  Honduras is in favour of greater democratizationof the principal organs of the United Nations. We take theview that an increase in the number of permanent andnon-permanent Members of the Security Council shouldbe carried out in accordance with the principles ofsovereign equality of States and equitable geographical18distribution  and that it should reflect the expansion in themembership of the United Nations in recent decades so asto transform the Security Council into a more democraticand representative organ  that would thus be a morecredible and effective instrument in fulfilling its primaryresponsibility for the maintenance of international peace andsecurity without affecting its efficiency or the speed of itsdecision-making processes. Genuine democratization andreal representativity in the Security Council should be theprincipal basis for the expansion of twenty-first-centuryworld government.We would all like to see a more competent  responsiveand responsible United Nations. We should all like it to bebetter administered and more consolidated and to yieldtangible results. To this end  it is essential to undertakemeaningful reform in order to enhance its efficiency and toensure that the United Nations can have a secure financialfooting  robust administration and structural capacity  anda clear sense of purpose in tackling its tasks.The General Assembly should play the role nowplayed by costly world conferences  and it should be theforum for sustained thematic debates on important andtopical issues held at regular intervals. At the same time the traditional agenda of the Assembly should be cut backradically. Recurring items should be considered lessfrequently. We should impose a time limit on ourstatements  and we need to reform the structure of thecommittees and auxiliary bodies so as to avoid overlappingand duplication.My country  Honduras  is continuing to workvigorously to strengthen  among other things  its democraticsystem of government  to bolster judicial power  to organizethe national police under civilian rule  to modernize theState  in addition to striving to create a new frame ofreference to promote development on the basis of fullparticipation by all sectors of society.Honduras  like all other developing countries  is deeplycommitted to processes designed to combat poverty andunderdevelopment and to mobilize the potential of itspeoples and resources in order to attain speedy  fair andsustained growth  working jointly to enhance the effect ofnational efforts through solidarity  cooperation and mutualconfidence.However  there are still many economic and financialobligations that need to be met in the short- and medium-term. International cooperation is steadily declining  andpoverty indicators are becoming worse.We wish to see a world where countries  mindful oftheir diversity  act together to attain common goals  aworld in which peace  security and dignity will be thecommon heritage of all peoples  a world in which theadvances of science will serve to benefit humankind and in short  a world in which existing resources are usedrationally in order to meet everyone’s needs. This is ourunderstanding of what  in essence  North-Southcooperation should mean.As the United Nations enters its second half-century we have an opportunity to work towards the objective ofits Charter — world cooperation in deterring and haltingaggression — and to foster peaceful  productive andsustainable human progress. In this respect  “An Agendafor Development” offers a unique opportunity to make theissue of economic and social development a centralpriority of the multilateral system. Promotion of sustainedeconomic growth and eradication of poverty in thedeveloping countries  as well as the legitimate leadershipthat the United Nations should show in this field  mustalso be key objectives of the Agenda.My country hopes that the negotiations on theAgenda for Development being held by the Ad HocOpen-ended Working Group of the General Assembly onAn Agenda for Development will conclude promptly andsuccessfully in the course of the fifty-first session of theAssembly. The completion of this work will be a point ofdeparture because it will give rise to firm commitmentsand mark the beginning of the task of putting the actionsagreed upon into practice.Honduras  as a peace-loving country  reaffirms itstotal support for the principles and objectives seeking thecomplete elimination of nuclear weapons and to establisha universal  verifiable  multilateral and effectivemachinery that will help to promote nuclear disarmamentand to prevent proliferation of such weapons in all itsaspects.Consistent with these principles  I am pleased toannounce that Honduras has signed the ComprehensiveNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty at this session of the GeneralAssembly  and I would venture to appeal to all StatesMembers of the United Nations to sign it as soon aspossible. We would also urge all States possessingnuclear weapons to take resolute steps to reduce themwith a view to their elimination.The existence of landmines and other undetonatedexplosive devices in various regions of the world is a19tremendous humanitarian problem and a grave threat to thesecurity  health and survival of the local population wherethese deadly devices have been scattered. These devicesprevent the return of refugees and displaced persons to theirhomes in the States affected by this ongoing menace andimpede humanitarian operations and programmes  nationalreconstruction and economic development activities andpeacekeeping operations.For this reason  we urge Member States  particularlythose that have the capacity to do so  to lend theirassistance to the affected countries  including those of theCentral American region  with a view to establishing andrefining national mine-clearance mechanisms. We alsoappeal to the international community finally to agree onthe total prohibition of the production  exportation  sale anduse of anti-personnel mines.My delegation wishes once again to place on record itsinterest in seeing the Republic of China in Taiwan admittedas a Member of the United Nations. At this moment intime  when democratic systems of government and the ruleof law are gaining ground in most of the nations that makeup this Organization  it seems contradictory to continueexcluding the Republic of China in Taiwan fromparticipation. This is a country which struggleddeterminedly for democracy and succeeded in establishingit this year with the election of a Government by the directvote of the majority of its people. This is a nation thatrespects human rights  possesses one of the strongesteconomies on earth and has been constantly struggling toeradicate poverty  and whose population of 21 millionpeople enjoys an enviable cultural level. In short  theRepublic of China in Taiwan fully meets the requirementsestablished in the Charter for membership of the UnitedNations.For the developing countries  its participation in thevarious international forums would be extremely beneficial since we would be able to draw on its valuable experiencein cooperation programmes  as demonstrated when itoccupied a seat in this General Assembly from the day itsigned the Charter until 1971.In this respect  my Government supports the resolutionadopted on 19 July 1996 by the European Parliamententitled the “Role of Taiwan in InternationalOrganizations”  which explicitly states its support for theidea that the Republic of China in Taiwan should have agreater level of recognition and representation ininternational agencies. It also urges the United Nations toestablish a working group to study the possibility of itsparticipation in the activities of the United Nations and itsinternational agencies.The problem of drug production is not as severe inthe Central American region as it is elsewhere  althoughour countries are not unaffected by drug use. For thisreason  on 21 June  the Ministers of the Interior of ourregion agreed to develop a plan of cooperation to fightthis evil. In this regard  we support the initiative ofconvening a special session of the United Nations GeneralAssembly in 1998 in order to strengthen the internationalstrategy to combat narcotic drugs.With a view to beginning to address the problem ofthe efficiency and effectiveness of the United Nationssystem  1996 could be a year of meditation and reflection.Calls have been made for a redefinition of the purposesof the Organization and  in particular  of the tasks of theSecurity Council. In order to achieve this important task we must work on the basis of a shared and balancedvision of the future of the Organization. The constructionof a culture of international peace  security and prosperityshould be the ultimate goal in this redefinition of tasks.This is something that the United Nations mustaccomplish in response to the needs of our peoples.As we approach the end of the century and themillennium  the globality of economies and the groupingof countries into systems of integration are becomingirreversible facts. One consequence of this will be theresurgence of mega-States in which smaller States willremain submerged. We are concerned for the future ofweaker and less developed nations which  like ours require great external and internal efforts to retain theidentity that distinguishes them from the rest of the world.The right of peoples to decide their own destiny onthe basis of sovereignty is enshrined in the Charter of theUnited Nations. This right must be observed in the newworld order if we wish to preserve  as is our duty  peaceand cultural plurality among nations."
"72",3020,"HRV",51,1996,"﻿At the outset  allow me toextend my heartfelt congratulations to the President on hiselection to the high office from which he will guide thework of the fifty-first session of the General Assembly. Iam confident that his diplomatic experience andcommitment to the noble principles of the Charter willimpress upon this session new commitment  determinationand vigour. I would also like to express our gratitude tohis predecessor  Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral of Portugal for the skilful manner in which he presided over the workof the fiftieth session.After having been the focus of the internationalcommunity’s attention for a long time  due to its beingexposed to aggression and to its being part of the mostserious regional crisis since the Second World War Croatia has now entered a new era of its history as a free sovereign and fully independent State. Croatia is now ina position to deal with and resolve almost all its externaland internal affairs with its own resources  and throughclose cooperation with the international community as anequal partner.It gives me great pleasure  therefore  to be able tolead the Croatian delegation at the fifty-first session of theGeneral Assembly with the strong conviction that the timeof war is finally behind us and that in the region of south-east Europe  Croatia is no longer a part of a larger crisis but rather an active and decisive agent of introducing thefinal solution to the crisis and the emerging internationalorder. In this connection  our external and internalpolicies are becoming increasingly peace-oriented anddevelopment-focused.So far Croatia has been successful in dealing withthe question of its statehood and the right of small nationsto full self-determination  as well as in defending theserights within the framework of and through the UnitedNations. We are enormously grateful to this nobleinstitution and its associated agencies  and especially tothose Member States whose sons and daughters areexposed to risk  in some cases giving their lives  in anoble endeavour to assist us in ending the horrific war ofaggression against our country and in the wider region.Croatia has played host to one of the largest  mostexpensive and complex peacekeeping operations in thehistory of the United Nations. Croatia’s Government andpeople  the hundreds of thousands of displaced personsand refugees in particular  have on many occasions beencritical of the ineffectiveness and ambiguity ofpeacekeeping mandates. Today  however  the war hasended  and we are finally coming to terms with all of thepolitical  economic and procedural constraints which theinternational community had to overcome in order to23properly react to the aggression  the calamity of war andthe diplomatic uncertainty resulting from the breakup of thecommunist federation of Yugoslavia and the securityvacuum resulting from the closure of the cold-war era.Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina indeed paid ahigh price for their struggle to ensure their survival alongside the progressive efforts of the internationalcommunity to develop a new concept of the United Nationsand other international mechanisms for the peacefulresolution of conflicts. However  we believe that ourexperience has given a very positive impetus to the intrinsicneed to reform the general concept of peacekeepingoperations  the work of the Security Council and thechanges in the regional  political and security systems inEurope as well.Even though the mandate of the joint peacekeepingforces in Croatia has not yet ended — 5 000 peacekeepersare still working in the Croatian Danubian area — I wishto convey to the Assembly the optimism of my Governmentfor the successful completion of the mandate of the UnitedNations Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia Baranja and Western Sirmium (UNTAES) there. Thisoperation just may become the most successfulpeacekeeping operation in recent history  and perhapsrightfully so  given our own and international frustrationswith the unsuccessful attempt at peacekeeping andpeacemaking in the region so far.The successful completion of the UNTAES operationis becoming ever more likely given the recent signing of anagreement on normalization of relations between theRepublic of Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslaviaand the establishment of a new balance in the region  thesame balance that helped the international community forgethe Dayton Peace Agreement.We are grateful to all Member States that supportedour appeals and calls in the General Assembly for universalrespect of international law — as reflected  for instance  inGeneral Assembly resolution 49/43  which created thepolitical conditions and legal framework for the peacefulreintegration of Eastern Slavonia. We are also grateful toMember States whose diplomats and soldiers are moredirectly involved in the successful implementation of theUNTAES mandate.Thanks in part to General Assembly support for theuniversal principles enshrined in the Charter and in part tothe intervention of United Nations peacekeeping forces  thecountries which emerged following the dissolution of theformer Yugoslavia are now increasingly heading towardsthe objective of peacefully resolving mutual problems ona bilateral basis and through regular multilateral contacts thereby lessening the need for international involvementand mediation. Those problems include the succession tothe former State; regional security arrangements and armscontrol; the search for missing persons; reciprocalminority rights; and the reestablishment of bilateraleconomic  cultural and other forms of cooperation. Thesuccessful expansion of bilateral neighbourly relationsbased on internationally accepted principles cannot bereplaced by the imposition of superfluous and ambitiousregional associations.Taking account of this new reality  in which Croatiaand the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia are prepared toresolve all their outstanding problems on a bilateral basisas two equal and sovereign States  the need for thecontinued presence of peacekeeping forces in Croatia hascome to an end.Any further extension of the UNTAES mandate inCroatia can only encourage delays in its implementationand place at risk the most critical aspect of the mandate:the return of 80 000 Croatian and non-Serb refugees anddisplaced persons to the region. The continued lack oftangible progress in this area could induce internal andexternal instability; this is a matter which my Governmentand the international community should seek to avoid atall costs. For this reason  the clear stance of myGovernment is that the peaceful integration of the regionunder the present UNTAES mandate should be completedon schedule.With the signature of the normalization agreementbetween Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia the small United Nations Mission of Observers inPrevlaka  Croatia  will also become obsolete in theforeseeable future. Croatia and the Federal Republic ofYugoslavia have agreed that the issue of Prevlaka is to bedealt with and fully resolved as a security matter  inaccordance with the United Nations Charter and thepolicy of good-neighbourliness. Therefore  there shall beno further raising of the question of territorial adjustmentsbetween Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslaviaon the Prevlaka peninsula  the five-century-old boundaryline between Croatia and Montenegro. However  there isa need to establish a security regime there throughpeaceful negotiations with a view to the mutual benefit ofcross-border economic cooperation.24On the basis of the new reality  Croatia’s foreign andinternal policy priorities will now aim at compatibility withand timely integration into European regional organizations.At the same time  we remain cognizant of ourresponsibilities in respect of the peaceful and successfulstabilization of neighbouring Bosnia and Herzegovina  inwhich Croats are one of the three constituent peoples. Theprocess of the internal stabilization of Bosnia andHerzegovina will take years and  in this regard  Croatia isfully open to cooperation and collaboration with theinternational community. The community’s presence andassistance there has been significantly less costly to itthanks to Croatia’s resources and contributions. Followingthe initial reconstruction assistance for Bosnia andHerzegovina  an economically viable Croatian State canmake the greatest contribution to the viability of theBosnian Federation and to Bosnia and Herzegovina as awhole.Croatia is prepared to recognize the results of everydemocratic political process between the three constituentnations and the two entities in Bosnia and Herzegovina andwill continue to give its full support to the successfulimplementation of the Federation Agreements.Croatia  fully supportive of a properly balancedFederation as defined at Dayton — the 1—2—3 formula:one State  two entities  three constituent peoples — seeksnot only to ensure the survival of the Bosnian Croats as aconstituent people in all respects  but also to avoid anysituation that could lead to a threatening instability in theregion as a whole. In that sense  any attempts to change theconstitutional definition of the Federation or to achieve thesame results through institutional or power-sharingarrangements are unacceptable to the Republic of Croatia asa party to the relevant Agreements. The same applies to anyattempts to change the present entities settlement through anover-centralization of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Anyterritorial adjustment at the expense of Bosnia andHerzegovina or its two entities shall be viewed as highlydetrimental to the stability of the region in general andconsidered a threat to Croatia’s security.As Croatia continues to move to reestablish itsEuropean way of life  while at the same time bringing itsyoung democracy and its governance into conformity withthe new European democratic reality  constructive criticismof its actions and attitudes will continue to be taken in goodfaith. By now  we have accepted the fact that  owing to theneeds of the multilateral crisis-management process in theregion  the standards set for Croatia in many areas ofdemocratic development are much higher than for othercountries in transition. Croatia’s extraordinary opennessto the innumerable institutions that monitor developmentson our soil  especially in the field of human rights  atteststo the transparency of our policy and to our deepcommitment to democratic values  tolerance andindividual rights.In renewing our expressions of gratitude to theUnited Nations for its contribution to the successfulresolution of an act of aggression against a Member State we should like to express the readiness of our country which now has a wealth of experience in peace-mediationefforts behind it  to contribute actively to similar UnitedNations efforts outside our region. We should now like tobecome active in the other regular activities of the UnitedNations and regional mechanisms  to which we offer ourexperience and experts  to further the common interestsand ideals of the Charter of the United Nations.Croatia is actively following the reform process ofthe United Nations system  and actively participates insome aspects of reform. We fully recognize the need toreorganize the system and adapt it to the changinginternational system. New objectives are already clearlydefined in the socio-economic sphere  and the area ofhuman rights in particular. The United Nations is facedwith new realities and problems centred around its goal ofpromoting the rights of the individual while preservingthe identity of groups and nations and respecting thesovereignty of Member States.We are following with particular interest the processof resolving the financial crisis of the United Nations. Asa small State that has experienced exceptional financialneeds and shortfalls over the past five years  Croatiasupports efforts to find a more equitable scale ofassessment for Member States that are experiencingextraordinary situations and whose capacity to pay has accordingly  changed significantly.Croatia has already spoken in favour of reformingand strengthening the United Nations system  andespecially the Security Council. Our position takes intoaccount new realities in which economic powers such asGermany and Japan  but also individual regions andStates — and their views — must be more justlyrepresented. Therefore  Croatia firmly supports theexpansion of the Council to 25 members in bothcategories of membership. Greater transparency in thework of the Council is also essential  and should beachieved through the adoption of new rules of procedure.The Organization will also be strengthened by the present25discussions on changes in general procedures  that will inter alia  reduce and rationalize the costs of overlappingactivities of various United Nations institutions. Weespecially support efforts to rationalize and restructure thesocio-economic sector of the United Nations so that it cancontinue to achieve its rightly ambitious goals around theworld.In its post-war foreign policy and economic activities Croatia will firstly associate with countries on its continent but will also strive towards diversification of its relations.Croatia wishes actively to contribute to the promotion ofthe common interests of small and  especially  new States.We are pleased to note that apart from the trendtowards institutionalizing regional development andfunctional cooperation  we are entering an era in whichStates are increasing their level of cooperation  throughmultilateral diplomacy  on basic development questions such as: the environment; developing the laws of the sea;enforcing international humanitarian law; protecting humanand minority rights; protecting the rights of women andchildren; promoting disarmament and non-proliferation;and sharing knowledge and resources to help thedevelopment of the Third World. We are  therefore passing over old ideologies  religious or regionalaffiliation and loyalties. One area in which Croatia will beespecially active is the establishment of the internationalcriminal court. We will be one of the sponsors of a draftresolution calling for the timely establishment of thisinstitution.The world we live in is entering a stage of nationalindividualization but also of ever-closer functionalcooperation between States in creating a stable andinterdependent new order. Croatia  as a young State thatstill harbours painfully fresh memories of its struggle forits identity  freedom and right to economic development sincerely wishes to contribute to the establishment of thisnew order by actively helping to find solutions to othercrisis points  development problems  and disproportions incontemporary societies around the world."
"73",3065,"HTI",51,1996,"﻿Almost two years have passed since the establishment ofconstitutional order and the rule of law in Haiti. The spectreof an illegal government and the acts of violence itperpetrated has vanished. The Haitian people  with thesupport of the international community  have succeeded indemonstrating in a country that the rule of law is moreimportant than effectiveness where political shake-ups arecommon. Today  democracy and tolerance are part of theHaitian scene  breathing new life into the struggle topreserve freedom.However  for this success to be complete  it must leadthe way to security  knowledge  expertise and hope and tothe well-being of seven million Haitians  who are stillwaiting for the realization of the dreams inspired by thereturn to democracy. Thus  the thorny question of socio-economic recovery — the true prerequisite for theconsolidation of democratic gains — is more pressing thanever.The United Nations has since 1991 been a focalpoint for the Haitian people  because the Organization dideverything in its power to give full force to the rule oflaw in my country. That is why I attach great importanceto the outcome of the fifty-first session  which shouldconfirm the commitments we made last year  at thecommemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of theOrganization  to peace  international security anddevelopment. I am certain  Mr. President  that yourleadership  your experience and your personal qualitieswill ensure the success of our work.I should like to take this opportunity to pay a well-deserved tribute to His Excellency Mr. Diogo Freitas doAmaral for the work that he accomplished as President ofthe fiftieth session.I also wish to pay sincere tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  whose tireless effortsare breathing fresh life into the Organization. TheGovernment of Haiti acknowledges his active role inresolving the Haitian crisis. His latest report on thesituation in our country reveals the perceptiveness of hisanalysis and his profound understanding of Haitianaffairs.Since the international community  through theUnited Nations  has invested in Haitian renewal  we havea duty to report to the Assembly on the progress made bythe Haitian Government and the difficulties it is facing and on its commitment to national development and tointernational peace and security.The general elections held on 17 December 1995 ledto the installation on 7 February 1996 of a new Governmentand to the renewal of Parliament. The new Governmentteam is striving to ensure respect for public freedoms andhuman rights  in spite of the various constraints it is facing.It is encouraging free expression of opinion and theestablishment of organized bodies to improve thefunctioning of civil society.However  in its efforts to establish a democraticsociety and the rule of law  the Haitian Government mustlabour under two constraints: the economic problems thatworsened after the coup d’état and the shortcomings of thejudicial system  which have given rise to frustration amongthe population. Those factors have combined to create astate of affairs favourable to those forces that are againstchange  which have not yet abandoned their plans todestabilize the Government.With respect to the reform of the justice system  theGovernment is mindful of the urgent need to end theincompetence and corruption of most magistrates. To thatend  on 3 October of this year it submitted to Parliament abill outlining the substance of the reforms to be undertakento correct the discredited justice system and make it morecredible and accessible.An independent judiciary will be a crucial element inthe reform. The Government is taking every step to ensurethe elimination of any hindrance to judicial impartiality andintegrity. Similarly  it is doing its utmost to provide thesystem with the means it needs to function properly.For some time now Haiti has been experiencing anacute economic crisis. National productivity is declining.Infrastructures are seriously dilapidated. Real grossdomestic product fell an average of 5.11 per cent from1991 to 1995. The country’s balance of trade is in chronicdeficit  amounting to $440 million  or 22 per cent of grossdomestic product for fiscal year 1994-1995. Exports havedropped to less than $100 million.At the macroeconomic level  the Government iscurrently pursuing an economic policy that takes intoaccount the need to curb inflation  balance the budget reform financing  combat corruption  impose austerity onpublic administration and ensure equilibrium among themacroeconomic variables.That programme  which is supported by theinternational financial institutions with which we haveworked out clear-cut modalities for negotiation andcooperation  will enable us better to meet an economicand social future that will be more promising and thatwill better favour the integration of the Haitian economyinto the world scene.A production-oriented policy should emphasizeincreased agricultural and industrial output. However  wemust take into account that Haiti’s agriculture is in crisisbecause it is unable to meet its two main goals: foodsecurity and increased export earnings for the country.Thus  the Government is striving to establishtechnological and social conditions that can relaunchnational agricultural production.In the same spirit the Government is giving specialattention to relaunching industrial production. A strategyhas been developed to restore a climate favourable tobusiness  which is a necessary condition for promotinginvestment  which is the driving force of industrialdevelopment. There can be no question that such anobjective can be achieved only through close cooperationbetween the country’s various sectors. We believe  interalia  that a dynamic private sector open to foreigninvestment is a necessity for economic growth.The present Government recognizes that futuredevelopment can be achieved only if we protect ournatural resources. Thus  it intends to take steps to curbdeforestation and soil degradation. Safeguarding ourenvironment is one of our priorities.Equally aware of the role played by the touristindustry in the world economy  the Government hasdevised a set of directives covering the principal elementsof national tourist policy. It is encouraging to note thatactivities in that sector are beginning to pick up.On the social level  the Haitian Government believesthat there is a vital need to combat poverty  illiteracy anddeficiencies in health care. The struggle against povertyentails a demonstration of strong political resolve todistribute the country’s scanty resources on a fairer basisand to take steps to combat unemployment and encourageprivate investment.The persistence of a high rate of illiteracy is a majorhandicap when it comes to improving economic resultsand raising social standards. Over the next four years theGovernment intends to achieve a significant increase inthe number of children attending school. Here  we shouldnote that particular attention is being put on improvinghealth conditions in the country  and in that regard a2programme of action has been developed that will beimplemented by mobilizing all available resources and withthe support of certain bilateral and multilateral partners.The task before us is enormous  but we are confidentthat we can meet the challenge  thanks to the determinationof the Haitian people and the continuing support of theinternational community  which has been unstinting in itsefforts to help resolve problems that threaten internationalpeace and security.On the subject of international peace and security  theinternational community has once again this year been tornbetween fear and hope as it has confronted developments insituations in various parts of the world. Long-standingconflicts have shown encouraging positive signs  while newoutbreaks of violence have exacerbated world tensions.Thus  the Haitian Government welcomes the positivedevelopments in the situation in the former Yugoslavia marked by the holding of general elections in Bosnia andHerzegovina. It is truly heartening to see that the peaceprocess has once and for all  we hope  replaced the spiralof warfare and hatred  with its concomitant systematicviolations of human rights.The initiatives taken by the Organization  in particularthe creation of the United Nations Protection Force and theInternational Tribunal for the Prosecution of PersonsResponsible for Serious Violations of InternationalHumanitarian Law  have greatly contributed to creating aclimate favourable to peace and ethnic reconciliation in thatcountry.With regard to the Middle East  my Governmentwishes to express its satisfaction at the resumption ofdialogue there. It encourages the two parties to continuetheir efforts to achieve lasting peace in the region  inkeeping with the relevant United Nations resolutions.On our own continent we welcome the prospects ofpeace that have appeared in Guatemala  after 35 years ofarmed conflict. The Haitian Government commends theUnited Nations on the leading role it has played in thatpeace process.Our Organization should not only intervene in regionaland inter-State situations that pose a threat to internationalpeace and security but also contribute to help eradicate suchdangerous evils as international terrorism and illicit drugtrafficking or to assist in finding solutions to certainproblems that threaten mankind’s survival  such as thenuclear-arms race. In that regard  my Governmentfollowed with interest the negotiations held within theframework of the Geneva Conference on Disarmamentand decided to become a sponsor of the draft resolutionsubmitted to the General Assembly  in the conviction thatthe Treaty was already a step towards nucleardisarmament. That is why  two weeks ago  on behalf ofmy country’s Government  I signed the text of theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty  whose adoptionby 156 States Members of the Organization eloquentlyattests to the profound desire of all nations to build asafer world for future generations.Terrorism and illicit drug trafficking also representgrave threats to international peace and security.Coordinated action involving all members of theinternational community will be increasingly necessary inorder to eradicate these scourges. As far as terrorism isconcerned  the Haitian Government has always vigorouslycondemned indiscriminate acts of violence againstinnocent individuals and believes that the internationalconventions adopted on this question provide a legalframework for the prosecution of the perpetrators of suchcrimes. However  along with laws and criminalpunishment  we must also try to find a solution to theproblems at their source.Mindful of the gravity of the situation  the membercountries of the Organization of American Statesconvened a specialized conference on terrorism that metin Lima  Peru  from 23 to 26 April 1996. The Republic ofHaiti signed the Declaration adopted on that occasionwith a view to preventing  combating and eliminatingterrorism within the overall framework of the applicabilityof international law  respect for the sovereignty of States the principle of non-intervention and strict compliance byStates with their rights and duties. The HaitianGovernment also subscribes to the new actionsrecommended by the Ministerial Conference held in Parison 30 July 1996.In the area of international drug control  I would liketo note that the Republic of Haiti is aware of the effortbeing made by the international community to tackle thephenomenon of drug abuse and drug trafficking. It isincreasingly necessary for us to define  by means ofappropriate conventions  an integrated framework for therelentless struggle that we need to wage against drugs inall phases: production  consumption  abuse  money-laundering and money-recycling  extradition andinternational prosecution of traffickers and confiscation ofgoods.3Last year the commemoration of the fiftiethanniversary of the Organization allowed us not only to takestock of its record and of the activities it has undertakenbut also to reopen the question of the reform of the UnitedNations necessary to tackle the challenges of theapproaching twenty-first century.As far as the expansion of the Security Council isconcerned  the Haitian Government would like a consensusto be reached on a new configuration of that importantbody that would favour active participation for all States inthe activities of maintaining international peace andsecurity.At the same time  we need to find ways and means torevitalize the Economic and Social Council. Whilerecognizing the positive actions of the Economic and SocialCouncil in various aspects of development over half acentury  the Haitian Government believes that it is possibleto improve its operation in order to make it a moreeffective instrument to promote sustainable development.We stand at a turning point in history where we arefaced with grave dangers as well as many signs of hope. InHaiti we are striving to restore hope to our people in orderto make a complete break with a past of suffering anddeprivation. It is also the responsibility of all States tomake the reform of our Organization a reality so that it canusher in a better world for future generations."
"74",3111,"HUN",51,1996,"﻿May I  at the outset  extendthe congratulations of my delegation to you  Sir  upon yourelection as President of the General Assembly at its fifty-first session. In your endeavours  based on your richdiplomatic experience  you may count on the assistance andsupport of the Hungarian delegation.Let me also pay tribute to your predecessor Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral  for his extremely ableleadership throughout our historic fiftieth session.The diversity of challenges facing the community ofnations  the difficulties associated with finding properresponses and the importance of building up supportivenational and international constituencies are hardly likely tosend multilateralism into oblivion. Yet  in this time ofchange  and despite the forceful tendencies of globalization interdependence and integration  no single applicableapproach is at hand for political leaders. Given its uniquerole and capacities  the United Nations can be theprincipal vehicle by which the international communityselects and addresses problems requiring a universalresponse.This Organization  however  cannot and should notmicro-manage the solution to all the urgent problems ofour contemporary world. Times have changed and somust the United Nations. In several instances  theinternational community may act much more efficientlythrough regional organizations or specialized agencies.What is essential  however  is that the nations formingthis Organization stand up with one strong voice when thepurposes and principles of the Charter are put to the test.Violations of international law  human rights andfundamental freedoms should be matched with legitimateand adequate responses by the international community acting through the United Nations.The issue of multilateral disarmament and non-proliferation remains a legitimate concern for the UnitedNations. Last year  we were pleased by the indefiniteextension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation ofNuclear Weapons. This important step not onlyconstituted a major building block in the complex web ofour non-proliferation and disarmament efforts  but servedas a catalyst to forge consensus around the futuredirection and dynamics of this process. As a result ofsustained and responsible work in the Conference onDisarmament  it became possible to finalize the text ofthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT).Hungary stood fully behind this compromise text  whichcaptures the diversity of views and approaches while stillconstituting a coherent and forward-looking document.Opening the Treaty for signature was  indeed  alandmark. Hungary was among the first countries tosponsor resolution 50/245. I signed the Treaty on the dayafter it was opened for signature. This Treaty is not theend of the process. There is a need for further systematicand progressive efforts towards nuclear disarmament andnon-proliferation  and the CTBT must be given its dueplace in that process. In this context  we join those whocall for its smooth entry into force  thereby allowing thedisarmament process to proceed.Hungary also consistently seeks to contribute to thestrengthening of stability and security through cooperativeefforts at both regional and bilateral levels. Building uponour intensified relations with the European Union  welook forward to the early beginning of negotiations on our7accession to the European Union. We hold the firm viewthat the enlargement of the North Atlantic TreatyOrganization (NATO) will expand stability and security inEurope and will strengthen trans-Atlantic partnership andsolidarity. Hungary  in its bilateral relations withneighbouring countries  is striving to contribute to theestablishment of conditions enabling them all to be fullpartners in the institutions of Euro-Atlantic integration. Weremain convinced that  with an enlarged NATO and anexpanded European Union  the United Nations will haveeven more efficient and helpful regional partners.The crisis in the Balkans has proved to be a painfuland dramatic litmus test of the resolve of the internationalcommunity. The United Nations has also had to draw itsown conclusions from the tragedy. The mission of theUnited Nations Transitional Administration for EasternSlavonia  Baranja and Western Sirmium is currently makingprogress on the road to the peaceful reintegration of theregion into Croatia  while securing respect for the humanrights of all its inhabitants and the rights of nationalminorities in the region. In Bosnia and Herzegovina  therole and determination of the Implementation Force (IFOR)is indispensable for guaranteeing the implementation of theDayton Agreement. The cooperation  through IFOR between NATO  the United Nations  the Organization forSecurity and Cooperation in Europe and the Council ofEurope in responding to the different facets of this majorchallenge is an innovative paradigm for future conflictresolution and crisis-management efforts.We strongly believe that a solid international presenceis required to allow democracy and stability to take firmroot in the region. Hungary continues to provide thenecessary logistical and transit facilities to IFOR forces andUnited Nations peace-keepers and is contributing to thestrength of both IFOR and the United Nations InternationalPolice Task Force. The return and reintegration of refugeesand displaced persons — including those who found shelterin Hungary — pose a continuing challenge to theinternational community. The establishment of democracyand the rule of law should be accompanied byreconstruction and rehabilitation  thereby facilitating theconditions of safe and orderly return. Citizens should beassisted by the international community in their efforts tocreate and activate democratic institutions in which goodgovernance and accountability will force war criminals outof the political mainstream. We see the work of theTribunal in The Hague as an essential component of theDayton peace process and the cooperation extended to it asan important indicator of the willingness of the parties tofollow through on both their Dayton commitments andtheir obligations under the Charter.Experience of the recently held elections in Bosniaand Herzegovina suggests that keeping to the scheduleagreed at Dayton was a sound decision. We remainconcerned  however  at the ethnically divided votingresults. This only highlights the urgency of proceedingwithout undue delay to the building-up of a uniqueinstitutional infrastructure for the country and offacilitating the holding of municipal elections in a morestable political environment.We are now in a period of reflection with regard toUnited Nations conflict-prevention and crisis-managementcapabilities. In our view  the United Nations  as itcontinues to live up to its responsibilities under theCharter  ought to craft its response strategies morecarefully. The preventive capacity of the United Nationsshould be further strengthened. A sound early warningsystem  combining political  military  humanitarian human rights and economic areas  would broaden the baseof options and enhance the chances for success in theearly detection of conflict situations. An earlyinternational monitoring presence in itself has a majordeterrent effect. In-depth information on a given situationwould catalyse diplomatic efforts and help trigger a broadconsensus on the course of action.Specialized agencies and regional organizations  suchas the Organization for Security and Cooperation inEurope  are of primary importance in defusing sources oftension through creating appropriate and efficient responsemechanisms. The United Nations  while fully dischargingits responsibilities under the Charter for the maintenanceof international peace and security  can authorize and thusgive legitimacy to these endeavours as well as to actionsto be taken by ad hoc coalitions of the able and willing.The building-up of regional peacekeeping and peace-building capacities  as well as the increase of theoperational character of some key activities of specializedagencies  are among the avenues that have to be morefully explored.The reform agenda of the United Nations has beenput in motion against the background of these newchallenges and opportunities. Despite considerableprogress in identifying the main areas of change withinthe different negotiating structures  we are seriously8concerned that the overall reform process has lost most ofits dynamics. While we should not allow that individualconsensual elements of the reform process be held hostageto progress in unrelated issues  there seems to be an evidentneed to reach a political agreement  at least on the basicphilosophy of the major premises of the reform agenda.Hungary is aware of the difficulties that make real progressso hard to achieve. It stands ready to help reinvigorate themomentum for change and to make genuine United Nationsreform an early reality.Promotion of the international protection of humanrights is a fundamental component of my Government’sforeign policy and one of the essential tasks conferred uponthe United Nations by its founders. Despite the remarkableresults achieved in the standard establishment and building-up of implementation machinery  there is still much to doin maintaining our determination to act in defence of humanrights  wherever abuses may occur. Chronic underfunding lack of efficient coordination and the sometimes evasive oruncooperative attitude of several Governments onlyunderline this urgency  which was finally recognized whenhuman rights were made one of the programme priorities ofthe United Nations. In our view  the United Nations  despitethe important advances made  such as the establishment ofthe post of High Commissioner for Human Rights  is stillnot sufficiently equipped to deal with the latest and gravestof human-rights challenges: those emanating from ethnicconflict  civil strife  government breakdown and thecollapse of the rule of law.The importance of safeguarding and monitoring theobservance of the rights of national or ethnic minorities isstill too often disregarded and put in the context of politicalexpediency. Lack of full respect for the rights of minorities together with the absence of necessary political  legal institutional and administrative guarantees  are among theroot causes of many of the conflicts on our agenda.Today  as we witness the growing importance ofhuman-rights operational activities  the timeliness of theconcept of preventive peace-building comes to mind. Thisimplies not only an enhanced human-rights preventive andmonitoring capacity of the United Nations  but also theright combination and use of the assets at our disposal from early warning to preventive protection. The practiceof financing some United Nations human-rights fieldoperations from the peace-keeping budget and a greatercoordinating role for the High Commissioner for HumanRights may be two of the avenues which deserve our fullattention.I wish to underline the fact that the way in whichthe United Nations tackles the crucial global problemsmankind is facing will greatly determine the quality of theimminent next century. Let me refer  in this context  tothe importance of some of the problems on the agenda ofthis session. Sustained efforts to combat internationalterrorism  transnational crime or illicit drug trafficking arerequired from all of us in order to preserve theinternational legal order  the present achievements andfurther potential of democracy and development. TheUnited Nations has an important role in coordinatingefforts to ensure that those involved in terrorist activitiesfind no safe haven and expect a vigorous response fromthe international community. Transboundary criminalactivity and drug-related money-laundering require thestrict application of the law by strong  independentjudiciaries. Our task is to make use of the advantages ofmultilateral cooperation in this field.The Republic of Hungary stands ready to work inpartnership with Member States to promote efficientmultilateral action and to translate into deeds the nobleideals set forth in the Charter of the United Nations."
"75",3158,"IDN",51,1996,"﻿It is with great pleasure thatI extend my delegation’s heartfelt congratulations to you Sir  on your election to the presidency of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-first session. We are deeply gratifiedto see an eminent representative of a brotherly neighbouringcountry and fellow member of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) preside over our sessions.Your election to this high office is also a well-deservedrecognition of your personal qualities and professionalaccomplishments  as well as of the role and stature ofMalaysia in regional and global affairs.May I also extend our felicitations to yourpredecessor  Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral of Portugal  forso ably presiding over the historic fiftieth session.Let me avail myself of this opportunity to pay tributeto Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali for his manyaccomplishments  his untiring efforts in the cause of peaceand development and the sagacity with which he is steeringthe Organization during these challenging times.During the commemoration of the fiftieth anniversaryof the United Nations last year  we noted a resurgence ofhope and optimism in the international community as wereviewed the achievements of the world Organization  madein spite of the many constraints with which it has beensaddled. We renewed our determination to strengthen theUnited Nations and rededicated ourselves to the vision ofworld peace that inspired its founding  as well as to theideals and principles enshrined in its Charter. That act ofrededication was timely and necessary. For  since thedemise of the cold war  the world has been in the grip ofmassive changes that have given rise to new challengesand contradictory trends in international relations. At thesame time  new vistas have emerged and a deepeningsense of interdependence has prompted nations to devisemore realistic and more mutually beneficial patterns ofcooperation.Yet  while these developments have revivedexpectations of a more peaceful and secure world  theacute reality is that our planet is still far from being apeaceful place. Violent conflicts continue to embroil manyregions of the globe. Nation States and internationalinstitutions are frantically struggling to adjust todrastically changed and changing political and economiccircumstances. Weapons of mass destruction still pose apotent threat of worldwide catastrophe. In view of allthese  it is no wonder that  after a momentary resurgenceof hope  we are again being overtaken by a sense offrustration and common vulnerability.The primordial challenge of our time  therefore  is todevise a more effective system of global governance inorder to manage the demands and the vicissitudes ofglobalization and interdependence. As emphasized in astatement recently issued by 16 Heads of State orGovernment  including the President of Indonesia  nationsshould rise from their immediate concerns  focus on theircommon long-term interests and break new ground.Constructive initiatives are needed  and multilateralismhas to be reasserted and strengthened.Not even global cooperation  however  can meet theneeds and expectations of people without a strongerUnited Nations to give coherence to such cooperation.World governance  therefore  in order to be effective andacceptable to all  must be fashioned with the UnitedNations as its principal mechanism and source oflegitimacy. The revitalization of this internationalinstitution through a comprehensive process ofrestructuring and democratization of its major organs andfunctions has therefore become imperative.It is of pivotal importance that the GeneralAssembly  the highest deliberative and decision-makingorgan within the United Nations system  should functioneffectively. Indeed  strengthening the role of the GeneralAssembly is a basic premise of the current process ofUnited Nations reform and revitalization.9Just as crucial is the reform of the Security Council soas to allow it to reflect contemporary realities and toaccommodate the interests and concerns of developingcountries  which comprise the overwhelming majority of theOrganization. It is an anachronism and a gross anomaly thatEurope is overrepresented  Asia underrepresented andAfrica and Latin America not represented at all on theCouncil’s roster of permanent members. In our view  newpermanent members should be chosen on the basis not onlyof equitable geographic representation  but also of suchcriteria as political  economic and demographic weight their capability and proven track record of contributing tothe promotion of peace  security and development  bothregionally and globally  and their commitment to assumingresponsibilities inherent to permanent membership.The Economic and Social Council is now beingrevitalized so that it will have a more dynamic relationshipwith the General Assembly and other United Nationsbodies. Yet  regrettably  it is still unable effectively to fulfilits crucial role  notably in helping United Nations Membersadjust to the complex demands of globalization. Thereforms and adjustments that the Economic and SocialCouncil is undergoing should be further strengthened toenhance its cooperation not only with other United Nationsbodies but also with such important international agenciesas the Bretton Woods institutions.All these efforts to revitalize  reform and democratizethe United Nations  however  will come to naught if in theend the United Nations is paralysed by financial insolvency.If the current financial plight of the United Nationscontinues — and it will continue as long as certain majorMember States refuse to remit their legally-obligatedcontributions — there is a real danger that peacekeepingoperations will collapse and many endeavours to maintainpeace and security will be compromised. The veryfunctioning of the United Nations itself could be severelyundermined and the purposes of the reform processseriously jeopardized. No organization can be reformed bystarving it. Ironically  the countries that are pressing thehardest for cutbacks and reforms have themselves refusedto finance the new austerity budget. For more than fivedecades the United Nations and related institutions havebeen engaged in an immense array of activities that touchevery aspect of people’s lives all over the world. If thosevital statistics  too  must be terminated because of theOrganization’s insolvency  that would constitute anenormous human tragedy.Nuclear arsenals of enormously destructive powercontinue to pose a threat to all life on Earth. We believethat the time has come for the Conference onDisarmament to establish a special committee fornegotiations on a programme of nuclear disarmament andthe ultimate elimination of all nuclear weapons within adefinite time-frame. In this regard  it is my hope that therecent Advisory Opinion of the International Court ofJustice on the illegality of the threat or use of nuclearweapons will serve as a catalyst towards this end.The 10 countries of South-East Asia recently madea substantive contribution to the cause of nucleardisarmament. During the historic Bangkok summit of theAssociation of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)  theseven ASEAN leaders  together with the leaders of Laos Cambodia and Myanmar  signed the Treaty on the South-East Asia Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone. ASEAN is nowworking for the Treaty’s early entry into force. We hopethat the nuclear Powers will soon endorse the Treaty byacceding to its Protocol. Thus  with the conclusion ofTreaties for nuclear-weapon-free zones in South-East Asiaand Africa  in addition to the Antarctic  Rarotonga andTlatelolco Treaties  a large segment of the southernhemisphere should become free of the nuclear menace. Asfor chemical weapons  I am pleased to inform the GeneralAssembly that Indonesia is now at the final stage of theprocess of ratifying the Chemical Weapons Convention.Another positive development was the signing a fewdays ago of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty(CTBT) after two and a half years of arduous negotiationsin the Conference on Disarmament. Indeed  for the pastthree decades  the international community unceasinglystressed the need for such a treaty in an endeavour tostem the horizontal and vertical proliferation of nuclearweapons. The Treaty outlaws nuclear-test explosions byall States in all environments for all time  ensures that theban is effective and verifiable and provides new groundfor the realization of the objectives set by the 1995Review and Extension Conference of the Parties to theTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.Having become a reality through broadcompromises  however  the Treaty is still a far cry fromthe CTBT long-envisioned by the internationalcommunity. It still allows the most sophisticated form ofnuclear-weapon testing: simulation. In a strict sense therefore  it is not truly comprehensive  nor does itdirectly address the issue of nuclear disarmament. But itdoes limit the nuclear-arms race by making it moredifficult for countries to develop or improve theirarsenals. Moreover  humankind cannot afford to dispensewith the CTBT  imperfect as it may be. Our collective10experience in the disarmament endeavour has been that  ifwe pass over an existing opportunity in favour of a betterone that is yet to be  we suffer a costly delay and possiblyan irretrievable setback. Having signed the Treaty on thatbasis  Indonesia fervently hopes that it will eventually besupported by the entire membership and thereby become aneffective instrument to enable us to move towards the totalelimination of nuclear weapons.Focal points of conflict still persist in many parts ofthe globe. In the Middle East  the peace process is on theverge of collapse as a highly volatile and explosivesituation in the Israeli-occupied Arab territories threatensonce more to engulf the region in all-too-familiar violenceand bloodshed  which we had hoped had become part of thepast. Israel’s provocative action of opening a new entranceto the tunnel along the Western Wall of the Al-AqsaMosque has triggered a violent confrontation  resulting indeath and injuries to scores of civilians. Further aggravatingthe situation is the unprecedented armed clash between theIsraeli army and the Palestinian police. These are but thelatest manifestations of a rapid deterioration of the situationdue to Israel’s reneging on its previous commitments andits blatant backtracking on its obligations under the 1993Declaration of Principles and subsequent agreements.Israel must be prevailed upon to honour theDeclaration of Principles and its subsequent agreements andto resume negotiations in earnest on the remaining issuesand the final status of the occupied territories  includingJerusalem. Once again  we emphasize that progress on theIsraeli-Syrian and Israeli-Lebanese tracks of thenegotiations  attended by unconditional withdrawal of Israelfrom the Syrian Golan Heights and southern Lebanon constitutes a conditio sine qua non for comprehensive andlasting peace in the region.The recent elections in Bosnia and Herzegovina  madepossible by the cessation of hostilities as a result of theDayton and Paris peace Agreements  have brought thecountry nearer to reconciliation and paved the way for thecreation of durable national institutions.However  we are concerned that  especially in theSerb-held areas  the results of the election may lead to thelegitimizing of ethnic separation. It is therefore incumbentupon the international community to ensure the unity andterritorial integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina as amulticultural  multi-ethnic and multireligious society. Forthe peace Agreement to be implementable  obstructions tofreedom of movement must be removed and refugeesallowed freely to return to their homes. Bosnian Serbleaders must yield their illicit control over segments ofthe population and territory of the country. The parties tothe peace Agreement must ensure that those indicted bythe International Tribunal are brought to justice.In the Gulf region  we have recently witnessedunilateral military action by extraregional Powersinterfering with the internal affairs of a Member State ofthe United Nations. My delegation wishes to reiterate itsfirm commitment to the sovereignty and territorialintegrity of States  in this case Iraq. Actions that areinconsistent with these basic norms and principles ofinter-State relations  which are enshrined in the UnitedNations Charter  are clearly unacceptable. I should alsolike to seize this occasion to urge Iraq to comply fullywith all relevant Security Council resolutions.Earlier this month  almost a quarter of a century ofconflict in the southern Philippines came to a peacefulend with the signing of a peace agreement between theGovernment of the Republic of the Philippines and theMoro National Liberation Front  with Indonesia servingas facilitator on behalf of the Organization of the IslamicConference Ministerial Committee of the Six. Thispositive development  which will bring peace andprosperity to the southern Philippines  also constitutesanother important step towards the realization of apolitically stable  socially cohesive and economicallyprogressive South-East Asia that is increasingly able todeal with its own problems in its own way.We are now living in an era of globalization andinterdependence  an era replete with challenges but alsofull of promise. How it came about is no mystery. It hadbeen creeping up on us for quite some time  theconsequence of rapid advances in science and technology particularly in communications and transport. The end ofthe cold war and the dismantling of the barriers of blocpolitics and ideological contention unleashed the full forceof globalization. Since then  global trade and productionhave been boosted to new heights while goods  peopleand capital are moving from one country to another morefreely than ever. Globalization has thus raised the hopesof humankind with visions of a new world ofopportunities and more equitable prosperity.These hopes are not without foundation. In a globaleconomy that is gradually recovering from recession  thedeveloped countries  according to the 1996 Economic andSocial Survey  have shown average gross-national-productgrowth rates of two per cent. The developing countrieshave registered a significant 6 per cent growth while theeconomic dynamos of East and South-East Asia have beencredited with a stunning 8 per cent growth. These are thetrade-driven economies that have benefited most fromglobalization.Yet  the apprehensions about globalization are equallyjustified. In an external environment over which developingcountries have very little control  globalization could widenthe prosperity gap between the developed and thedeveloping countries. The fact that globalization can alsolead to disaster was demonstrated not too long ago whenthe global operations of financial markets led to instabilityand volatility that sent shock waves through the monetarysystems of developing countries. In their efforts to integratethemselves into the global economy  many developingcountries have found it necessary to make structuraladjustments that too often entail exorbitant social andhuman costs. Moreover  globalization has not mitigated andmay have  on the contrary  exacerbated the inequities andimbalances in international economic relations. Bereft of afavourable external environment for their nationaldevelopment efforts  many developing countries continue tolanguish in poverty  backwardness  stagnation and evennegative economic growth. Every year  13 to 18 millionpeople  mostly children in developing countries  die fromhunger and poverty-related causes. Meanwhile  thedeveloping countries remain marginalized from theinternational decision-making processes that would fashionglobal solutions to the global economic problems that afflictthem.The poignant experience of the past three and a halfdecades teaches us that these problems cannot be solvedthrough palliatives and piecemeal reforms. Since the majorproblems of development are global in nature  they canonly be effectively dealt with through a new globalpartnership for development involving all countries  of boththe developed North and the developing South  on the basisof mutual interest and equitable sharing of benefits andresponsibility.It has been more than two years since the successfulconclusion of the Uruguay Round of multilateral tradenegotiations  but the promise of an equitable  transparentand rule-based multilateral trading system  as embodied inthe World Trade Organization (WTO)  has yet to berealized. Moreover  we are alarmed at the tendency of somedeveloped countries to resort to a new form ofprotectionism in the guise of linking labour standards andother social and environmental concerns to trade. Suchefforts will not only harm the developing countries  but willalso ultimately debilitate the WTO itself. We therefore callupon all trading partners to refrain from overloading theagenda of the first Ministerial Meeting of the WTO inSingapore this coming December with issues extraneousto trade. Let us together nurture the WTO as the guardianof a predictable  non-discriminatory multilateral tradingsystem and the guarantor of the rights of the weakertrading partner against unilateral and arbitrary actions bythe strong.In this context  we share the concern expressed bythe international community at the practice of somecountries of promulgating national laws withextraterritorial application that adversely impact on thelegitimate interests of other countries. We cannot acceptthe imposition of the law of the strong in place ofdialogue and negotiation. No one country  no matter howpowerful  should be allowed unilaterally to regulate thelives of other sovereign countries.The biggest single deterrent to development in manyof the world’s poorest countries is the crushing effect oftheir debt burdens. Indonesia has long advocated a set ofprinciples for managing the debt problem  calling for a“once-and-for-all” settlement of the debt problems ofdeveloping countries  including multilateral debts  as wellas the cancellation of the debts of the most severelyaffected  low-income developing countries. In this context we welcome and support the joint proposal of the WorldBank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF)  whichoffers effective alternatives for reducing the overall debtburdens of heavily indebted poor countries to sustainablelevels. While this initiative could be further refined  it isIndonesia’s fervent hope that  at the forthcoming meetingsof the World Bank and the IMF  this proposal will finallyreceive the support that it needs and deserves from thedeveloped countries. In this context  I am encouraged bythe developments at the IMF meetings in Washingtontoday.Social development and social justice remain elusivedreams for millions of impoverished people throughoutthe world. Indonesia shares that dream and abides by thecommitments it assumed at the World Summit for SocialDevelopment in Copenhagen and the Fourth WorldConference on Women in Beijing  both of which wereheld last year. We have indeed dedicated ...We have  indeed  dedicated ourselves to theproposition that people should not only be the12beneficiaries of development but should also be given everyopportunity to become the authors of their owndevelopment. At the same time we should address  throughconcrete and concerted international action  the problem ofthe global trade in illicit drugs and other forms oftransnational crime. Above all  we must continue to addressthe problems of poverty and underdevelopment  and wemust commit ourselves fully to genuine partnership.This century that is about to end will perhaps beremembered for both the cruelty of its wars and thetremendous achievements that it has seen in science andtechnology — although it is not for these achievements thatwe should be proud of it. To my mind  what makes thiscentury special is the fact that during this time the humanrace truly began to nurture the idea that poverty is not aninevitable part of the human condition  but that it can beconquered and wiped off the face of the Earth. We have thenatural resources and the mental and organizational capacityto succeed at that task. The question has always beenwhether we have the political will to do it  and whether weare concerned and enlightened enough to form an equitableglobal partnership for development — for a concertedstruggle against poverty that will give a deeper and brightermeaning to globalization and interdependence. The answer I believe  is largely in the hands of the General Assembly."
"76",3205,"IND",51,1996,"﻿It gives me great pleasure tocongratulate Ambassador Razali on his election asPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-firstsession. He is not present here  but I would like to saythat he is no stranger to India. We are fully cognizant ofhis sagacity and skills and repose our confidence in hisability to successfully guide the General Assembly duringits fifty-first session. May I also express my delegation’swarm appreciation for the presidency of his predecessor His Excellency Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral  for a mostproductive tenure as President of the Assembly in itshistoric  landmark fiftieth year.Six years ago I had the privilege of addressing thehistoric forty-fifth session of this Assembly. We rejoiced12at the end of the cold war and believed that the animosities rivalries  suspicions and intrigues that had bedeviled thepast would now be overcome and the problems of theworld and their solutions could be addressed with greater perhaps pristine  clarity. We have welcomed the reductionof global tensions and the opening up of new economicpossibilities between nations.However  we cannot say that the new dawn has led toa new and genuinely cooperative web of kinship andcollaboration. Regional conflicts and tensions continue tooccupy us. Development problems remain acute  and thereis less sensitivity to the genuine needs of struggling nations.The voice of the rich and powerful nations rings louderthan ever  while the developing world feels itself moremarginalized and ignored than ever.In these circumstances  it is even more necessary tostrive for a genuine spirit of joint international endeavourin addressing the world’s problems. The United Nations isthe foremost embodiment of multilateralism. No singlenation or even group of nations today can expect to findsolutions to the world’s problems  nor are many problemsamenable to solutions in isolation. Global problems requireglobal institutions and global solutions. This role and dutycan fall only to the United Nations.We are concerned at unilateral actions and at theevident decline in the commitment to obligations under theCharter of the United Nations. International cooperation isnecessary to meet the vast development needs of thedeveloping countries  to eliminate weapons of massdestruction and to fight terrorism and crime. The UnitedNations system  under which sovereign nations have joinedtogether to achieve their common objectives  is theuniversal framework for international cooperation. TheCharter of the United Nations is the real basis for renewingmultilateralism. India recently joined 15 other Heads ofState or Government in stating that“either nations move forward to strengthen(multilateralism)  or we risk having to face moreunilateralism and perhaps conflict and overt disregardof international law and common values”.The United Nations is at a crossroads. Its financialcrisis is the result of an unwarranted unwillingness on thepart of certain countries to pay their dues in full and ontime. Such deliberate targeting of the United Nationsrepresents the most acute threat to multilateral cooperationand can do incalculable long-term damage.Beyond the financial crisis of the United Nationsitself is the critical issue of financing global cooperation.While the world remains confronted with enormousproblems of poverty  malnutrition  disease  ecologicaldegradation and waste  the will to contribute is on thedecline. Development assistance is at its lowest level indecades. Negotiated replenishments of multilateraldevelopment funds are not being honoured.It is unfortunate that voices continue to be raisedquestioning the role of the United Nations in theeconomic growth and social development of developingcountries. It is necessary to restore to the United Nations in the coming century  the important role of eradicatingpoverty and all the ills associated with it  of promotingdevelopment and achieving social progress and betterliving standards  with more freedom for all.For this purpose  the multilateral economic systemneeds to be reformed and the partnership of the UnitedNations with other relevant institutions must to bestrengthened in order to achieve greater economic growth integration and sustainable development. The UnitedNations and the Bretton Woods institutions need todevelop an effective partnership. While India welcomesthe initial  tentative steps towards such a partnership effective economic leadership requires that we work toensure a much closer relationship between globaleconomic institutions than has been the case so far.Indeed  there is no alternative if the financing of long-term global cooperation in economic and social fields isto be assured. We need larger volumes of financialassistance  greater predictability of resources andunfettered access to the markets of developed countries.It is also time that we energize our efforts to complete theAgenda for Development and launch an effective follow-up process  including in the context of the recent majorUnited Nations conferences.India is unreservedly committed to the protectionand promotion of human rights. The profoundlyhumanistic traditions of Indian civilization  with itsemphasis on tolerance  harmony  non-violence and theinviolability of the individual  have been consolidated inthe Constitution of India  which is indeed a veritable billof human rights. All human rights are sacrosanct in India guaranteed by its Constitution  an independent judiciary a free press  public opinion vigorously expressed and anindependent National Human Rights Commission. To usin India  the human rights of all segments of society aresacrosanct and an article of faith rather than a policy.13We believe that international cooperation in theprotection and promotion of human rights should proceedwithin the framework of respect for the sovereignty andintegrity of States. We deplore the selective use of humanrights issues as a form of political pressure  as an obstacleto trade or as a condition for development assistance. Suchactions detract from the moral imperatives of human rightspromotion and impede the full realization of the humanrights of all people.Human rights violations take many forms. Among themost pernicious of them is terrorism. Terrorism seeks toexploit the openness and freedom offered by democraticsocieties to pursue narrow ends through the use of violence.It must be combated by firm action at the national andinternational level. We are dismayed when we hear certainparties voice concern for the so-called rights of terroristswhile ignoring their persistent violation of the human rightsof their victims  including the right to life  freedom ofexpression and the freedom to follow religious beliefs ofone’s own choice.India took the lead in raising the issue of terrorism asa threat to human rights almost five years ago. We arepleased that despite initial and sometimes vocal oppositionby some western countries  terrorism is now accepted to bethe major threat to the enjoyment of human rights today. Anumber of international declarations have been issued onterrorism such as the Sharm el-Sheikh Declaration  and theG-7 Lyons Declaration of 27 June 1996. We areencouraged that the international community nowrecognizes terrorism as a major challenge to democracy human rights and peace. In this context  India will pursueits call to adopt a binding international convention tocombat terrorism.Fifty years after the United Nations was established the threat to humanity posed by nuclear weapons continuesunabated. We believe that India’s security  as indeed that ofall countries  lies in a nuclear-weapon-free world.The only way to achieve this ultimate security is toban the production  possession and use of nuclear weaponswithin an agreed time-frame. Partial and half-hearted armscontrol measures  such as the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) or theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT)  defeatthis objective by legitimizing the possession of nuclearweapons and permitting the non-explosive testing of nuclearweapons by nuclear-weapon countries. India  therefore cannot be a party to such flawed arrangements.Let me also emphasize that any effectivedisarmament regime needs to be universal in its approachand scope. The total elimination of all existing nuclearweapons  as an indispensable step towards general andcomplete disarmament under strict and efficientinternational control  is the demand of the entire Non-Aligned Movement  to which we fully subscribe. Partialor regional approaches  as are sometimes put forward  donot serve any useful purpose and can distract us from theaccepted goal.At the same time  India remains committed toparticipating fully and actively in any negotiations on atreaty banning nuclear weapons and all types of tests  justas it did in regard to the Chemical Weapons Convention.India signed and deposited its instrument ofratification of the Convention on the Prohibition of theDevelopment  Production  Stockpiling and Use ofChemical Weapons and on Their Destruction two weeksago. India regrets that major chemical weapon producershave been slow to ratify the Convention. We urge allthose countries which have still not done so to ratify theChemical Weapons Convention and to demonstrate theirreadiness to move towards banning all weapons of massdestruction.India will work with all like-minded countries insponsoring draft resolutions on the establishment of an adhoc committee under the Conference on Disarmament forbeginning negotiations on a treaty banning nuclearweapons in a time-bound framework. India expects allcountries  including those represented in the CanberraCommission on the Elimination of Nuclear Weapons which support time-bound elimination of nuclearweapons  to join in supporting such draft resolutions.India will once again present the draft convention onthe prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons at thissession of the General Assembly. India believes that theurgency of negotiating that convention has been greatlyenhanced by the advisory opinion of the InternationalCourt of Justice regarding the illegality of the use ofnuclear weapons.At the recent session of the Conference onDisarmament  India joined 27 non-aligned and neutralcountries to present a phased programme for theelimination of nuclear weapons by the year 2020. Indiaasks that all countries join us in propagating andpromoting this joint proposal  both at the fifty-firstsession of the General Assembly and in other forums.14India is in favour of a non-discriminatory anduniversal ban on anti-personnel mines  which cripple or killa large number of civilians.The continued credibility of the United Nationsrequires reform of the Organization to reflect present-dayrealities. While the membership of the United Nations hasincreased greatly  the voices of the newly sovereigncountries in decision-making in the United Nations remainunheard. There is an imbalance in the authority and weightof structures and organs  just as there is an imbalance in theweight of different countries or groups. The GeneralAssembly  the sole universal organ of the United Nations needs to find greater resonance in other bodies of thesystem.The Security Council must be made morerepresentative in order to enhance its legitimacy andeffectiveness. The vast increase in the membership of theUnited Nations since its founding  especially of thedeveloping countries  must find adequate representation inthe categories of permanent and non-permanentmembership. A comprehensive proposal by the Non-Aligned Movement for the reform and restructuring of theSecurity Council is already on the table. India supports theexpansion of both the permanent and the non-permanentcategories. We are against piecemeal or temporary solutionswhich discriminate against developing countries. Webelieve that the same yardstick must be applied to allcountries  developed or developing  from all regions orgroups  for induction as permanent members. We believethat under any objectively derived criteria for the expansionof permanent members  India would be an obviouscandidate.Reform and expansion must be an integral part of acommon package. The restructuring of the Security Councilmust give expression to the impulse for reform. Thereforms must address not only the failings of the past  butalso the needs of the future.Peacekeeping is a significant area of United Nationsactivities  very often the most visible symbol of theOrganization’s presence on the ground. India hasparticipated in over 25 peacekeeping operations on fourcontinents  including some of the most sensitive andprolonged  starting with Korea in 1953 and 1954  andincluding the operations in Viet Nam  Congo  the MiddleEast  Cambodia  Haiti  Somalia  El Salvador  Mozambiqueand Rwanda. Indian peacekeepers are currently in the fieldin Angola  Bosnia and Herzegovina  Liberia and Kuwait.Our participation has not been without cost. We have lost100 peacekeepers for the United Nations cause. We havealso offered a fully-equipped brigade to the UnitedNations standby arrangement. The performance of theIndian troops has won universal recognition. India is oneof the few countries which can sustain large-scale troopcommitment over prolonged periods.Our participation in United Nations peacekeepingdoes not stem from considerations of narrow gain. Wehave participated because we have been wanted andbecause we have been asked  but most of all because ofour solidarity and empathy with the affected countries andwith the international community  as well as because ofour commitment to the United Nations and to the causeof international peace and security.India has offered its candidature for the non-permanent seat on the Security Council from Asia for1997 and 1998. Our candidature is rooted in the criteriastipulated in the Charter: the principle of equity  ourunwavering commitment to the United Nations  and to thecause of multilateralism  and our 50-year-longcontribution to the maintenance of international peace andsecurity and to the other purposes and principles of theOrganization. India has a unique record of supportingUnited Nations activities against apartheid andcolonialism. We have richly contributed to the debates ondevelopment  disarmament and human rights. We seek theonerous responsibility of Council membership convincedof the support of this Assembly.I would like to take this opportunity to pay a warmtribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for his successful stewardship during a mostdifficult period. His services are a distinct asset to thisworld body.Let me briefly refer to India’s interaction with theworld. We have witnessed some remarkable changes inthe last few years. New vistas for greater cooperation arenow visible. The challenge lies in effectively seizing theopportunities. We attach the highest importance todeveloping cordial and friendly relations with ourneighbours with a view to promoting peace  stability andmutual confidence in the region. We also seek to developstronger economic and commercial relations within theregion  for all-around prosperity. As current Chairman ofthe South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation(SAARC)  it will be our endeavour to promotemultifaceted cooperation in all spheres.15The economic reforms embarked upon since 1991have provided India with a new outward orientation thatseeks greater integration of India into the globalmarketplace. Today  India is branching out and adding tothe substantive content of its relations with individualcountries of the region and beyond  developing and buildingupon regional cooperation arrangements involving SAARC the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)  theASEAN Regional Forum  the Asia-Pacific EconomicCooperation Council (APEC) and the Indian Ocean Rim  toname a few.Convinced of the need and utility of enhanced South-South cooperation  we accord the highest priority to ourrelations with Africa  the Middle East and Central Asia. Weare proud to have been associated with Africa and itscauses in the United Nations since the inception of theworld body. We appreciate the role played by theOrganization of African Unity (OAU)  which has striven tofind regional solutions to African problems. Its efforts mustbe supplemented by the United Nations. The scramble forAfrica in the nineteenth century was for African land andresources. We hope that the closing years of the presentcentury will see a scramble to redress African problems  thegenesis of which largely lies outside the region. The UnitedNations must lead international efforts to meet Africa’sneeds and aspirations.We are deeply concerned at the recent seriousincidents of violence in the West Bank and Gaza and byIsraeli authorities’ opening of a tunnel beneath HaramAl-Sharif — the Temple Mount — in East Jerusalem which resulted in the tragic loss of several innocent livesand large-scale injuries following violent clashes. Thecurrent situation underlines the need for immediate andeffective measures to end the violence and to create aclimate that would enable purposeful negotiations based ona recognition of the underlying causes of the conflict. Thesedevelopments also serve to emphasize the need to buildfurther on the agreements and understandings alreadyreached.In the wave of the recent political changes in theMiddle East  India is encouraged by the reiteration by allparties of their continued commitment to the Middle Eastpeace process based on the framework established by theMadrid Conference. However  we are concerned that thesereaffirmations do not appear to have manifested themselvesin commensurate progress in the peace process. India urgesall parties to intensify their efforts towards realizing themutually agreed objectives of the Middle East peaceprocess  keeping in view that achieving durable peace andstability in the Middle East requires solving thePalestinian issue.India has ties dating back to early history withAfghanistan  a country with which we also share bonds ofkinship  culture and religion. We are deeply saddened bythe continued violence and loss of life in that country.India stands for the unity  independence and territorialintegrity of Afghanistan. We urge all Afghan parties toresolve their differences through early peaceful dialogueand negotiations. We support the efforts of the Secretary-General and his special representative to bring about asolution in Afghanistan.The Non-Aligned Movement figures firmly inIndia’s world view and constitutes an important plank inour foreign policy. We remain firmly committed to thephilosophy and values of the Non-Aligned Movement. Forus  non-alignment means independence of thought andautonomy of choice. It also means working in cooperationwith the largest number of countries. Last year’s non-aligned summit in Colombia reinforced our faith in theability and resilience of the Movement  its responsivenessto change and its effectiveness in today’s global situation.India will be privileged to host the next ministerialconference of the non-aligned countries in New Delhi in1997.India is a progressive country charting a balancedcourse between economic growth and social justice  andscience and tradition. It is committed to the values ofpeace  non-violence  coexistence  pluralism  tolerance andconstructive cooperation. Culturally  India is a bridgebetween traditional cultures and emergent trends.Politically  India will remain anchored in a pluralistic liberal democracy that can provide space for all itsconstituents and internal interlocutors.Before I conclude  I am reminded of an ancient RigVedic hymn which reads:“O citizens of the world!Live in harmony and concordBe organized and cooperativeSpeak with one voiceAnd make your resolutions with one Mind.”May this invocation to harmony  cooperation consensus and solidarity continue to guide ourdeliberations and actions.16"
"77",3251,"IRL",51,1996,"﻿Allow me  Sir  to offer you mywarm congratulations on your election as President of thefifty-first session of the General Assembly. I am veryconfident that  with your skill and experience  you willprovide the leadership and direction we require to ensure asuccessful outcome to the work of the forthcoming session.You have the assurance of our full support.I have the honour to address this Assembly on behalfof the European Union.Last year we gathered here on the fiftieth anniversaryof the United Nations. The speeches we heard thenreflected a dual message: a conviction that the UnitedNations remained more than ever indispensable in a worldof increasing interdependence among nations; and concernthat the Organization adapt and renew itself to serve theneeds of a new century. There was a clear call that thenon-payment of dues owed to the United Nations — thispoison in the system — should cease.The Declaration on the Occasion of the FiftiethAnniversary of the United Nations rightly anticipated“a sharp increase in the level of expectations of theUnited Nations” (resolution 50/6).It called for the occasion to be seized“to redirect it to greater service to humankind especially to those who are suffering and are deeplydeprived”.We have no need at the outset of the fifty-firstsession to seek a new agenda. Cooperation through theUnited Nations continues to offer the world theirreplaceable means necessary for advancing peace economic and social progress  human rights  democracyand caring humanitarian action. To retain theOrganization’s effectiveness  we need  together withadequate resources  a continuing modernization of thestructures and working methods of the institutions of theUnited Nations. What we must do now is sharpen thefocus on common priorities to achieve this and get onwith the decisions to give them effect.Globalization is one of the defining characteristics ofour age. With it has come the realization that our peaceand prosperity cannot be assured by States  or evenregions  acting in isolation. The European Union itselfembodies the principles of cooperation  interdependence human rights and democracy. The spirit of cooperation isalso the starting point for the contribution that the Unionis making at the global level  where the enormousbenefits that can be achieved by working togetherconstitute the greatest  and potentially the most rewarding challenge that faces mankind today.The very interdependence of our peoples  nationsand regions that leads us to assemble here as the UnitedNations should serve to underscore the unique role andpotential of this Organization  the sole such universalbody of global outreach. Has it done so? Have westrengthened the potential of the United Nations  or yetsufficiently exerted the energy and imagination necessaryto use the opportunities it offers us?We were able last year to reflect with justifiablepride on 50 years of substantial success by the UnitedNations. Our celebration was tempered  however  by asobering awareness that the level of conflict  economicdisparities and humanitarian crisis in our world wasincreasing  not diminishing. We had witnessed a series ofopen and bloody intra-State conflicts and the resurgenceof old antagonisms in many regions of the world resulting in death and injury to millions of innocentcivilians  many of them women and children; an increasein the already high number of refugees; gross and flagrantviolations of human rights on a massive scale; and thewidespread incidence of hunger  disease andhomelessness. At the same time  threats to the7environment and the scourges of drugs and terrorism wereamong a new range of risks and challenges that requiredconcerted international action.The urgency and complexity of these and otherproblems facing the United Nations at a time of greatpolitical  economic and technological change led us to acommon call for a United Nations revitalized and moreeffective in dealing with these new needs. Some progresshas been made in the past year in rationalizing UnitedNations activities in the economic and social fields and inenhancing efficiency and better management. This deservesto be recognized. But we are still far from the overallresults needed. Serious new efforts are required fromMember States and the Organization. The multilateralapproach which the United Nations embodies is underthreat if we cannot respond to the challenges before us. Weneed a renewed commitment to collective action  withstrong vision and leadership sustained by the political willof each Member State. The European Union renews againtoday its commitment to the United Nations. We aredetermined to equip it for the tasks of a new century.Recent experience has taught us that we need a moreencompassing strategy for conflict prevention and crisismanagement. This strategy has to address both the causesand the consequences of conflict. The Agenda for Peacewas a well-considered and timely initiative of theSecretary-General which points the way forward.Substantial lessons from the United Nations experience ofpeacekeeping have indeed been learned. They should beapplied in developing this new strategy.To secure peace  the root causes of conflict have to betackled. Too often the United Nations is called upon toreact to the appalling aftermath of conflict. Prevention is afar better strategy. Improved early warning through moreeffective and internationally coordinated efforts which alsotake account of economic and social factors can do muchto improve the quality of the response. There needs to bean increased emphasis on preventive diplomacy and on amore informed  better-planned and rapid response to crises including improved procedures for consultation withtroop-contributing countries. Existing mechanisms formediation  conciliation and good offices could be morevigorously and imaginatively exploited. Post-conflictrehabilitation has to be more comprehensive andcoordinated to address the wider issues of humanitarianassistance  economic and social reconstruction and respectfor human rights  democracy and the rule of law.Even with an improved approach to early warningand conflict prevention  peacekeeping operations will stillbe necessary. The experience of some recent difficultoperations should not detract from the record of successesin United Nations peacekeeping. The support of theEuropean Union for the peacekeeping role of the UnitedNations is undiminished. The member States of theUnion  my own included  have consistently providedresources and personnel to United Nations peacekeeping.The Union today provides the majority of personnel forcurrent operations and contributes some 37 per cent of theUnited Nations peacekeeping budget. This has involvedsacrifices  including at times the ultimate sacrifice. Onbehalf of the European Union  I pay tribute to thememory of United Nations peacekeepers who have laiddown their lives in the cause of peace and to the over25 000 peacekeepers currently serving in 17 UnitedNations peacekeeping operations.Too often  the United Nations has been called uponto intervene in conflict situations without a clear mandate adequate resources or the consistent political supportrequired to have any prospect of success. Too often  theUnited Nations has been confined to policing indefinitelya fragile and hostile peace between parties that  even afterdecades  show no real inclination to assume responsibilityfor securing a resolution of the conflict. This wastesmuch-needed United Nations resources. But moreseriously  it undermines confidence in the United Nations.If we apply our energies to developing new strategies forconflict prevention and crisis management  we will havedone much to strengthen the capacity of the UnitedNations in this core area. The European Union  for itspart  will work to strengthen and reinforce this vital roleof the Organization.The United Nations cannot be expected to standalone in conflict prevention and the maintenance of worldpeace. The European Union welcomes the trend towardscloser cooperation and mutual support between the UnitedNations and regional organizations. In Europe  theOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe(OSCE) has been designated as a regional arrangementunder Chapter VIII of the United Nations Charter. TheUnited Nations and the OSCE are already cooperatingclosely and coordinating their efforts. Within the OSCEarea  the European Union is working with all the OSCEparticipating States to develop further the concept ofmutually reinforcing institutions so as to enhanceEuropean security and stability. The Union encouragesand supports the similar efforts being made in otherregions. It is important that the United Nations benefit8from  and build on  these initiatives. The meetings ofregional organizations that the Secretary-General hasconvened in recent years are an important innovation in thisregard. Since its inception  the United Nations has playeda central role in the longer-term strategies for conflictprevention  in particular in the fields of disarmament andarms control  human rights and equitable economic andsocial development.The European Union attaches the highest priority toprogress in the fields of arms control and disarmament. Ifwe mean to invest in peace  then we must all becomeadvocates of disarmament. Today was a particularly goodday for disarmament and for the United Nations. It was myprivilege this morning to join with other colleagues in theEuropean Union in signing  on behalf of our respectiveStates  the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. TheEuropean Union would urge all States to sign and ratify thisimportant Treaty.We must respond to the clear wish of all our peoplesto live in a world in which the threats posed by nuclearweapons and weapons of mass destruction can be reducedand ultimately removed. We have made a start withConventions banning chemical and biological weapons. Thenext step is the start of negotiations for a cut-off treaty.The European Union will also give priority at thissession to measures to deal with the menace of theindiscriminate use of anti-personnel landmines. Today  thereare over 110 million landmines in our earth  mostly indeveloping countries. They kill  indiscriminately  26 000people every year  mostly civilians  many of them womenand children. Anti-personnel landmines have disabled aquarter of a million people.It is an incredible and obscene irony that at a timewhen the United Nations  with the active support of theEuropean Union and other States  is continuing its vitalwork of mine clearance  further millions of anti-personnellandmines are still deployed annually. The European Unionhas endorsed the appeal made by the Security Council to allStates to contribute to the Voluntary Trust Fund forAssistance in Mine Clearance. We call upon all MemberStates of the United Nations to join with the EuropeanUnion  in a spirit of common humanity  to put an end toindiscriminate killing and maiming by anti-personnellandmines.Conventional arms control  at both a global andregional level  also requires our attention. We now have theopportunity to overcome the mistrust and insecurity thatpreviously predominated in arms-control negotiations andto create a climate of transparency and cooperationleading to arms reduction. This process is under way inEurope. We would hope to see it develop in other regionsof the world.Failure to respect human rights and fundamentalfreedoms is a major cause of conflict today. Manyintra-State conflicts arise from the denial of basic humanrights to minorities and in some cases to wholepopulations. The democratic right of all citizens toparticipate freely and openly in the governance of theirsocieties continues to be under threat or denied. The battlefor the economic and social emancipation andempowerment of women has begun. This is an issue ofspecial importance for the European Union.The United Nations has since its inception been inthe vanguard in the promotion and defence of humanrights and democratic freedoms. Its record is indeed aproud one. The European Union will continue its support both material and political  for the vital ongoing work ofthe United Nations in this area. The Union believes it isessential to secure adequate financing from the regularbudget for the Office of the United Nations HighCommissioner for Human Rights and the Centre forHuman Rights. The European Union fully supports theDeclaration and Plan of Action adopted by the recentWorld Congress Against Commercial Sexual Exploitationof Children. This is a timely initiative in tackling thisappalling abuse  which affects all regions in the world.Despite decades of effort and resources  the povertygap has widened  not narrowed. For many of the least-developed nations  their development is regressing ratherthan advancing. The time is long overdue to mount a newglobal offensive against poverty  a major cause ofinstability and conflict. We will give major priority to thewar against poverty and the United Nations New Agendafor the Development of Africa in the 1990s initiative.A more vigorous effort is needed to carry throughmajor programmes for the economic and socialadvancement of women  as are more emphasis and actionon the gender perspective across the whole spectrum ofdevelopment.The European Union recognizes the central rolewhich the United Nations system  through its specializedagencies and programmes  has played and will continueto play in the humanitarian  economic and social fields.We need to reform and revitalize the United Nations9system in this area to ensure a real and lasting impact onsustainable development.Our aim is reform  not the retrenchment of resources.The discussions on “An Agenda for Development” havebegun this process. A sense of urgency is required to giveimpetus to our work during this session of the GeneralAssembly and to build upon recent progress. The EuropeanUnion will pay particular attention to the follow-up toresolution 50/227 concerning the revitalization of thesystem.Effective follow-up to the conclusions of theEconomic and Social Council (ECOSOC) substantivesession on humanitarian assistance will be vital to achievea stronger and more coordinated strategy within the UnitedNations system to deliver effective programmes where theyare most needed. We must also see progress in coordinatingthe outcome of recent United Nations conferences including the Habitat II Conference in June.The European Union welcomes the renewed emphasisof ECOSOC on the global threat posed by narcotic drugs.The Union is giving high priority to measures which willimprove the coordination of efforts to fight this threat which undermines the very fabric of all our societies.The success of the United Nations Conference onTrade and Development (UNCTAD) conference in Midrandis welcome in that it underlines that reform and progress inrenewing the system are possible.The forthcoming special session on Agenda 21 and thefollow-up to the Rio Conference will allow us to give freshimpetus to action on development and environmental issuesand renewed support to the work of the Commission onSustainable Development.The European Union invites all Member States to joinin a new global partnership for development. It is in thecommon interest of the peoples we represent to forge aglobal alliance against poverty  hunger  disease  ignoranceand deprivation. This is a key challenge for the UnitedNations and its Member States.Our endeavour to revitalize and reform the UnitedNations system is taking place against the backdrop of aserious financial crisis. This continuing crisis underminesthe necessary climate of partnership and the capacity toimplement current programmes in many areas. It distractsefforts and attention from the real tasks of the moment.The European Union has repeatedly stated that allMember States have an obligation under the Charter todischarge their arrears and pay their assessedcontributions to the regular and peacekeeping budgetspromptly  in full and without conditions. The Statesmembers of the European Union  which contribute over35 per cent of the regular and over 37 per cent of thepeacekeeping budgets have consistently honoured thisobligation. They believe that to resolve this crisis  allStates Members of the United Nations must do likewise.The Union recognizes the need for financial reformto secure the long-term financial stability of the UnitedNations. It has therefore put forward a set of proposalsaimed at achieving comprehensive financial reform including adaptation of the scale of assessments to makeit more genuinely reflective of the capacity to pay.This session should see resolute efforts to negotiatesolutions.The conflicts and tensions in today’s world arereflected in the memorandum distributed as part of thisspeech  in which the European Union outlines its positionon issues facing the world community. I would like todraw attention at this point to some critical areas of majorconcern to the European Union: the former Yugoslavia Cyprus  the Middle East peace process and the GreatLakes region of Africa.Europe has not been spared the tragic ethnic conflictwitnessed in other regions. The progress we have made inbringing an end to the savage war in the formerYugoslavia has required the combined efforts of theinternational community and a variety of international andregional bodies  including the United Nations  the NorthAtlantic Treaty Organization and the European Union.However  we still need to address the massivehumanitarian and reconstruction needs left in its wake  aswell as the more difficult and long-term task of rebuildingtrust  security and peace among the peoples of the regionand ensuring full respect for the territorial integrity of thevarious sovereign States.The European Union and its member States remaincommitted to full implementation of the provisions of thepeace Agreement for Bosnia and Herzegovina and tomaking a very substantial contribution to the concertedeffort being made to assist the parties who have primaryresponsibility for this implementation in living up to theirobligations.10There are daunting tasks ahead. The immediate focusis on the follow-up to the elections in Bosnia andHerzegovina which took place on 14 September 1996 underthe supervision of the Organization for Security andCooperation in Europe. On this occasion  I wouldacknowledge in particular the very important contributionthat was made by the Implementation Force and the UnitedNations in Bosnia and Herzegovina  including theInternational Police Task Force  in ensuring that theelections were conducted peacefully.The Union fully supports the strategy of the HighRepresentative  Mr. Carl Bildt  in regard to establishing thecommon institutions of the State after the elections. He hasthe full assurance of our support for his leading role in theimplementation process. We do not underestimate theenormity of this task. If we are to succeed in maintainingpeace  it is essential that the international communityclosely coordinate its activities and that all parties cooperatefully in the process. The European Union will work closelywith the United Nations and the international community toachieve an effective long-term strategy to secure peace andself-sustaining stability in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In thiscontext  the Union notes that parties have agreed to holdfurther elections in September 1998. An important focusduring the intervening period will be assisting the Office ofthe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees infacilitating the return of the many thousands of refugeesand displaced persons who have not yet been able to goback to their homes. Ultimately  our aim must be a returnby all the former Yugoslav republics to the community ofpeaceful and democratic nations.The basic agreement for Eastern Slavonia must beimplemented in full and the return of refugees anddisplaced persons to this region completed. Such personsmust be ensured of full protection for their human rights.The Union acknowledges the important work of the UnitedNations Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia Baranja and Western Sirmium  which enjoys our fullsupport in its efforts.The Union continues to attach great importance to fullcooperation with the work of the International CriminalTribunal for the former Yugoslavia. This work reflects theresolve of the international community to bring to justicethose responsible for war crimes and crimes againsthumanity. It is vital to efforts to develop justice  confidenceand democracy in the region that all parties fulfil thecommitments they have made to hand over indicted persons.The European Union stresses once again that thecurrent status quo in Cyprus is not acceptable. It reaffirmsits strong support for the efforts of the Secretary-Generalof the United Nations aimed at a negotiated and lastingsolution to the Cyprus question which will respect thesovereignty  independence  territorial integrity and unityof the country in accordance with the relevant UnitedNations resolutions. The European Union welcomes theappointment of the Special Representative of theSecretary-General  Mr. Han Sung-Joo. The Presidency ofthe European Union has also nominated a SpecialRepresentative on Cyprus.The Middle East peace process  based on theprinciples already accepted by all parties under theMadrid and Oslo frameworks  is the only path to securityand peace for Israel  the Palestinians and the neighbouringStates. The Florence European Council of June 1996reaffirmed the approach of the European Union. It furtherstated that peace in the Middle East was a fundamentalinterest of the European Union. The Union is thereforeconcentrating its efforts on encouraging all parties tore-engage themselves in this process and to respect andimplement fully all the agreements already reached.We wish to make an active contribution to promotethis process in both the political and economic fields andto build upon the important work which has been doneover the years by the United Nations in the interests of ajust  comprehensive and lasting peace in the Middle East.We would invite all Member States to do theirutmost to nurture this process and give encouragement toall parties to move forward.The Union is deeply concerned that the current lackof progress in negotiations should not undermine theprospects for peace. The progress already achieved shouldbe advanced by further agreement on concrete issues. Wehope that the recent meeting between the Israeli PrimeMinister and the Palestinian President will have positiveresults for the peace process. We call upon the IsraeliGovernment not to pursue the extension of settlements.Continued expansion of settlements does more than anyother issue to erode Palestinian confidence in the peaceprocess. It undermines the ability of both the PalestinianAuthority and society at large to deter extremists andtrouble-makers. As the largest donor  the Union remainscommitted to providing assistance to the Palestinianpeople and urges all parties concerned to contribute to theeconomic revival of the West Bank and Gaza. Thisendeavour will hopefully be rendered more effective bythe recent relaxation of the border closures  and we hopethat this encouraging trend will continue.It is important that all tracks of the peace processmove forward. We favour an early resumption ofnegotiations between Syria and Israel  and have reaffirmedour support for the independence  territorial integrity andsovereignty of Lebanon and for early negotiations involvingthat country.The creation of the Middle East peace process hasbeen a historic breakthrough in the long-standing search tobring to the peoples of the region the lasting and just peacewhich they clearly want and  indeed  they deserve. TheEuropean Union will intensify its efforts to ensure itssuccess.The European Union shares the heightened concern ofthe international community at the grave threat to peace andstability in the Great Lakes region posed by the currentsituation in Burundi. The United Nations and the EuropeanUnion are already involved in an international effort to copewith the aftermath of the Rwanda tragedy — the majorhumanitarian crisis  the serious refugee problem  and theongoing process of regional reconstruction. But at the sametime the area is again facing the prospect of bloody civilwar and genocide  in Burundi. We cannot allow this tohappen. The European Union strongly supports the effortsof the United Nations and the Organization of AfricanUnity to restore dialogue and democracy in Burundi. Itacknowledges in particular the pivotal role being played inthis endeavour by former President Nyerere  supported byother regional leaders. Their efforts are assisted by thespecial envoys of the European Union and the UnitedNations  and other parties.The international community  through Security Councilresolution 1072 (1996)  has sent a clear message to theparties involved that there must be an end to all violenceand an early beginning of unconditional and all-inclusivenational dialogue in Burundi. This is the only constructivepath to a solution which is lasting and based on anegotiated  democratic and institutional consensus whichensures security for all. The European Union remainswilling to support the necessary recovery process inBurundi once the path of dialogue is embarked upon by allparties with the resolve necessary to ensure a solution. Ittherefore calls on all parties to forsake violence and toengage in this process of dialogue.The European Union continues to be the major donorto the humanitarian and reconstruction needs of the region.It welcomes the progress in rehabilitation in Rwanda  towhich it contributes substantially  and it pays tribute tothe work of the United Nations in various sectors inRwanda.The return of refugees and national reconciliation inRwanda will remain a priority for the Union. We willalso continue to support the International CriminalTribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible forGenocide and Other Serious Violations of InternationalHumanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of Rwandaand Rwandan Citizens Responsible for Genocide andOther Such Violations Committed in the Territory ofNeighbouring States between 1 January and 31 December1994  to underscore our belief that the internationalcommunity must pursue and bring to justice those whohave perpetrated gross crimes against humanity.We have begun this fifty-first session with a signalof hope. The signature at the United Nations today of theComprehensive Nuclear-Test Ban Treaty shows thisOrganization in its rightful place — seized of the deepestconcerns of humanity. This is the place which thefounders sought for the United Nations. This is the placewhich it is our responsibility to ensure that it firmly holdsfor today’s world and for the generations to come.Lastly  and speaking solely in my capacity asForeign Minister of Ireland  I would like to inform theAssembly of developments in the Northern Irelandsituation over the past year. The search for a lasting peaceand a comprehensive political settlement continues.Substantial advances have been recorded in the past 12months  despite serious setbacks and despite theuncertainty and suspicion which still hamper thedevelopment of true reconciliation between thecommunities in Northern Ireland and between the maintraditions which share the island of Ireland.Negotiations involving the Governments and theparties began in June and resumed earlier this month. Thestated purpose of these negotiations is to achieve a newbeginning for relationships within Northern Ireland  withinthe island of Ireland and between the peoples of theseislands  and to agree new institutions and structures totake account of the totality of relationships.The Irish Government continues to base its approachto the negotiations on the fundamental principles set outin the 1993 Joint Declaration published with the BritishGovernment. As I indicated last year  A New Frameworkfor Agreement  published in 1995  represents the shared12assessment of the two Governments of a balanced andhonourable accommodation which might be envisagedacross all the key relationships. We shall in negotiationsmake the case for a fair accommodation along these lines believing as we do in the necessity of radical and ambitiouschange on all sides. At the same time  agreement requiresthe support of the political representatives in bothcommunities  and must also command majority popularsupport in both parts of Ireland.We continue to be firmly of the view that whollyinclusive negotiations  involving the representatives of bothcommunities in their totality  offer the best prospect ofachieving a durable settlement founded on a recognition ofthe rights and aspirations of all. The Irish Republican Army(IRA)  by terminating its cease-fire last February  not onlyperpetrated renewed death and destruction and flouted thewishes of the overwhelming majority of the people in bothBritain and Ireland. It also obliged the two Governments tocease ministerial dialogue with Sinn Fein  which  becauseof the collapse of the cease-fire  is currently not aparticipant in the negotiations.This is a matter of both regret and frustration. SinnFein has a potentially valuable and constructive role to playin contributing to a stable and far-reaching settlement. Butpolitical dialogue is sustainable and productive only on thebasis of the principles of democracy and non-violence. Thatis why there must be an unequivocal restoration of the IRAcease-fire before Sinn Fein can enter the negotiations which would be enhanced by their presence  as they are bythe continuing presence of the loyalist parties.Likewise  however  all of those truly committed tofinding an accommodation must impartially rejectsectarianism and oppose disorder from whatever source ifthey wish to create an atmosphere in which reconciliationcan flourish and agreement take root. The confrontation andpolarization which occurred during the past summer in the“marching season”  the consequences of which still vibrate highlight the absolute necessity of compromise and mutualunderstanding.The instrument for progress is to hand in the Talksprocess under way  if we can persuade all the parties to usethe Talks process constructively. That requires the earliestpossible transition to substantive negotiations. The IrishGovernment is working with the British Government topersuade the representatives of the unionist community toembark on this step without delay  secure in the knowledgethat the process already contains multiple safeguards including the guarantee of popular referendum  to ensurethat the interests of their community must be respected inany agreed outcome.The continuing support of the internationalcommunity is an invaluable asset on which we can drawin the search for a settlement. Most directly  thenegotiations benefit from the independent chairmanship ofSenator Mitchell of the United States  former PrimeMinister Holkeri of Finland  and General de Chastelain ofCanada  whose skill and authority command the respectand confidence of all participants. In addition  I wouldlike to express my Government’s gratitude for thegenerosity and support of all of our many friends in thisAssembly  in particular the Governments of the UnitedStates and of our European Union partners.The wounds of conflict are still deep and unhealedin Ireland. We can be under no illusion but that theprocess of reconciliation and the crafting of an agreementwill be slow and painstaking. But we have continued tomake progress on that journey  and we are committed tocontinuing in our quest for peace."
"78",3298,"IRN",51,1996,"﻿It is asource of profound satisfaction to see a diplomat of theexperience of Mr. Razali Ismail  representing Asia and thefriendly and brotherly country of Malaysia  presiding overthe fifty-first session of the General Assembly. I wish tocongratulate him on his well deserved election. I amconfident that  with his abilities  he will be able to steerthe work of this important session in an exemplarymanner. I assure him of the full cooperation of thedelegation of the Islamic Republic of Iran in discharginghis important mandate.The developments during the last decade on theglobal scene  particularly the demise of the bipolarinternational system and the need to replace it with a new24world order  have created many hopes and expectations.Nations around the globe  irrespective of their diversecultures  customs and religions  expected that on thethreshold of the twenty-first century the process for thecreation of a new world order characterized by collectiveparticipation and human development would emerge in aclimate governed by realism and a sober grasp of theessence of the ongoing changes in international relations.The essence of these international developments wasindeed the overwhelming rejection at the national level oftotalitarianism and dictatorship  with a profound messagefor humanity at large: if we desire to construct a world ofcollective participation and human development we mustbuild international relations on the foundations of justice tolerance  the rule of law  cooperation and transparency.Human society hoped and expected that justice wouldguarantee the inalienable rights of all individuals  nationsand States through a rejection of hegemony and specialprivileges for a dominant few; they hoped that  throughrecognition of diversity of cultures and beliefs  as well asrespect for the rights of all States  tolerance would facilitateintercultural communication and mutual understanding thereby enriching common human civilization andempowering all members of the international community toparticipate fully and effectively in determining the shapeand setting the norms and standards of behaviour in afuture world. They hoped that the rule of law would ensurethe security and legitimate interests of individuals  groupsand States.Cooperation would replace confrontation  bringingabout joint human efforts to resolve common problems andto further common objectives. Transparency  by providingobjective and clear explanations and solutions to globalissues  would consolidate mutual confidence at theinternational level.In such a world  the United Nations occupies aparamount position. It embodies the hopes and aspirationsof the entire membership of the international community and as such  provides a suitable framework for collective transparent and rule-based international decision-makingand implementation geared towards the promotion of thecommon good and the resolution of common ills. Theconvening of many international conferences in the pastdecade to articulate and codify further norms of behaviourfor an orderly new system  the relative success of theUnited Nations machinery in preventing and de-escalatingmany international and regional conflicts  and theconstructive debate on reinvigorating the General Assemblyand reforming the Security Council are positive examplesproviding hopeful signals in that direction.On the other hand  amid competition and rivalriesfor the shaping of the emerging world order  a newphenomenon has surfaced. This phenomenon is so distantand alien from the universally envisaged world ofcollective participation and human development that itsconsolidation and persistence would send any hope for aglobal human society to the oblivion of more rivalries andinsecurity. Indeed  concurrent with the expansion ofparticipatory democracy in many countries  a complexmovement has emerged towards autocracy or eventotalitarianism at the international level  a trend which isfounded on hegemony and flouts justice  freedom participation  the rule of law  tolerance  human rights pluralism and democracy in a dangerous andunprecedented manner.The evident behavioural characteristics of thismenace  disguised behind appealing facades  can besummarized in the following manner: first  there isunilateralism  which means a total lack of commitment tomutual cooperation and common solutions  and completereliance on unilateral measures in various fields. Secondcomes opportunism  in which international forums areresorted to only as mechanisms for the promotion ofnational self-interest and often in pursuit of a domesticagenda. Third  there is secrecy  which takes the form ofan insistence on dogmatic  non-transparent and closedmethods and a rejection of transparency  which impedesthe abuse of multilateral arrangements. Fourth comeslawlessness  which is the evasion of the rule of lawcoupled with audacity in breaking the law and universalnorms  even in a public and official manner. Fifth wehave imposition  which means the promotion of domesticagendas and national priorities through the imposition ofpolicies on others  including through the extra-territorialapplication of domestic legislation. And sixth there iscoercion  the unbridled recourse to the threat and use offorce in international political  economic and commercialrelations.The most notable manifestation of the newinternational totalitarianism surfaces in the cultural sphere.Our world is characterized by a diversity of religions civilizations  cultures and customs. This diversity hasnaturally resulted in the emergence of many systems oflaw and values  with similarities as well as differences.Regrettably  the claimants of world leadership have eitherfailed to grasp this self-evident reality due to their ownlack of historical and cultural depth or have found it25incompatible with their interests and therefore attempt toneglect it. More regrettable is the fact that the collaborationof certain other States in this field has exacerbated suchopportunistic intolerance.In this context  the misguided propaganda waged todistort the image of Islam  and the unprecedentedintolerance exhibited against the tide of Islamic resurgenceamong Islamic nations and States indicate a futile campaignto suppress this great divine religion of justice andtolerance  and of defiance against oppression  tyranny anddomination. The claimants of world leadership have yet torealize that a people’s religious devotion is intertwined withits very existence  and will only draw more strength andresilience in the face of campaigns of external pressure andnegative propaganda. The progressive march of the Islamicworld  which benefits from the rich heritage of Islamicculture  history and civilization  cannot be halted. Thus thissignificant and important segment of humanity willcertainly occupy an increasingly prominent role in theshaping of the future world order.The irreconcilability of totalitarianism with the rule oflaw has had dangerous manifestations on the internationalscene. The passing and signing of legislation to allocatemoney for subversive and terrorist activities against theIslamic Republic of Iran is the most dangerousmanifestation of this lawlessness  which is no longerconfined to the secrecy of intelligence services but has beenrecklessly made into law by the United States Congress.This law and similar unlawful behaviour  including theinfamous decision of the United States Supreme Courtapproving kidnapping by the United States Government represent a very dangerous trend. They illustrate a growingtendency to institutionalize and even legalize illegality anddisregard for international obligations.A similar pattern of behaviour that has beenmanifested in the past several years by the United StatesGovernment is the self-arrogation of the right to legislatefor the international community by attempting to apply itsdomestic legislation beyond its borders. Recent unilateralsanctions enacted by the United States against the tradingpartners of a number of countries not only constitute agrave breach of various norms and principles ofinternational law and many resolutions of this Assemblyand other international forums as well as blatantinterference in the internal and external affairs of otherStates  but  indeed  point to a very dangerous trend  whichundermines the very foundations of contemporary inter-State relations.The rejection of such legislation by variousGovernments and international forums along withuniversal resistance against their application illustrate thefact that unilateral interference  the imposition of policiesand the self-arrogated leadership of one State over thenational priorities and external relations of others cannotand will not be tolerated by the international community.The Islamic Republic of Iran has referred these twopieces of legislation to the pertinent international tribunal.We strongly believe that unless this dangerous trend isarrested at the earlier stages of inception  it will haveirreversible implications  including the undermining of thecredibility and reliability of international undertakings. Ifoutlaws are left to trample upon the rule of law  peaceand security around the globe will be in peril.The same general tendency of domination hasdebilitated the Security Council  which has repeatedlyfallen prey to the interests of a permanent member. TheCouncil  for example  not only failed to prevent the Israeliattacks against defenceless Lebanese women and childrenin a United Nations compound  but also turned a blindeye to reports substantiating the deliberate nature of theatrocity  thus putting aside its humanitarian and Charterresponsibilities in the interests of the politicalconsiderations of supporters of Israel.Relying on such unconditional support  the Zionistregime pursues with impunity its expansionist policies ofoccupation in Palestine  southern Lebanon and the SyrianGolan Heights  as well as its routine practice of Stateterrorism and blatant violation of the most fundamentalrights of the Muslim people of Palestine. Israel hasneither regard for international law nor any commitmentto peace  its only objective being the consolidation andexpansion of its occupation of the territories of others.Considering these realities  the only logical conclusion isthat peace in the Middle East requires a just andcomprehensive resolution of the question of Palestinethrough the return of all Palestinian refugees to theirhomeland  the exercise of their inalienable right to self-determination and the liberation of all occupied territories.It is noteworthy that the mere expression of suchrealistic analyses by a sovereign State is misportrayed asopposition to peace and provides the pretext for concern anger and even illegal political pressure. In other words the new international autocracy  contrary to itsproclamations of support for freedom of expression cannot tolerate the least dissenting view regarding itsdestructive policies.26The prevalence of such attitudes in the SecurityCouncil has clearly shown that the Council needsfundamental and substantive reform and modification particularly in its rules and decision-making procedures.The realities of today’s international scene are so differentfrom those prevailing in the aftermath of the Second WorldWar that the Security Council is weakened by its presentstructure and prevented from meeting the new challenges.On the other hand  the General Assembly enjoysgreater credibility in view of its relatively universal democratic and transparent character. This supreme body ofthe Organization should not become the forum for generaland inconclusive discussions. The Assembly  in accordancewith the Charter  must assume its rightful place as theprimary decision-making body on important internationalpolitical and economic issues.In today’s world  the imperative of global participationand collective effort in the advancement of commonobjectives and the resolution of international problems isself-evident because of the mutual interdependence of themembers of the international community. One of the mostnotable areas for serious cooperation involves the challengeof combating all forms of terrorism. Regrettably  the sameGovernment that has engaged in sponsoring and aidingvarious forms of terrorism — through  inter alia appropriating a budget for subversive operations againstIran  harbouring and assisting acknowledged terrorists  andsupporting Israeli state terrorism  mass murders andabductions — has also prevented serious internationalaction in this regard by irresponsibly levellingunsubstantiated accusations against others.I reiterate in this Assembly that levelling politicallymotivated accusations against one or a few States  groupsor regions cannot and will not help in the resolution of thismajor international problem. The eradication of thisinternational menace requires serious global cooperationbased on the following criteria: condemnation and rejectionof all forms of terrorism  regardless of the identity of thevictims or perpetrators and irrespective of their politicaltendencies and objectives; refusal to provide sanctuary toterrorists or terrorist groups and prevention of operations byor on behalf of terrorists; and cessation of all baseless andunsubstantiated propaganda and allegations. We once againreiterate our commitment to participating in any serious comprehensive and rule-based universal cooperation tocombat and eradicate this inhuman phenomenon.In the field of disarmament and in its efforts to endthe nightmare of nuclear holocaust  the internationalcommunity has been plagued by unilateralism  secrecyand evasion of the rule of law. Ironically  in recent years the major arms producers and suppliers have exhibitedmore concern over their proliferation than have thoseStates that do not possess such sophisticated weaponry. Atthe same time  the former have been reluctant to acceptany scheme of general and comprehensive disarmamentunder credible international monitoring.Some nuclear Powers and their allies continue toinclude the doctrine of nuclear response against non-nuclear threats in their defence alliances. In theInternational Court of Justice  these very Powers madeevery effort to prevent the Court from rendering adecision outlawing the use or threat of use of nuclearweapons.During the negotiations in the Conference onDisarmament on the finalization of the ComprehensiveNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty  in contravention of theAdvisory Opinion of the International Court of Justice onthe legal requirement of good-faith negotiations fornuclear disarmament  any reference to nucleardisarmament within a time-bound framework faced strongopposition by a small number of nuclear Powers. In thesame negotiations  insistence on unilateral  non-transparent national technical means — as opposed to amultilateral and transparent international monitoringsystem — created a major obstacle for consensus. Eventhe commonly accepted principle of negotiations toresolve these and other problems and to attain consensuson this vital international instrument was vetoed. Thisundemocratic and dogmatic procedure resulted in theAssembly’s approval and opening for signature of adefective Treaty that does not reflect an internationalconsensus. We  along with many other non-aligned States will join the signatories of this Treaty solely because ofour commitment to be an active participant in any effortto combat the inhumane weapons of mass destruction while at the same time redoubling our efforts to achievea nuclear-weapon free world.Non-proliferation policies have also been marred bydiscrimination  shortsightedness and ambiguity. On theone hand  Israel’s nuclear-weapons programme hascontinuously received the direct and indirect political andtechnical support of one State; on the other  theinterventionist policy of coercive deprivation of othercountries in the same region of their inalienable right toacquire nuclear technology for peaceful purposes hasbecome a cornerstone of the foreign policy of the verysame State.27The dissemination of false allegations to instil fear andanxiety  the depiction of an imaginary enemy and thefanning of division and tension have often been employedas pretexts to justify an external military presence andintervention as well as mind-boggling sales of excessiveand unnecessary weapons systems. This behaviourcharacterizes the United States policy in the Persian Gulf which has only resulted in the exacerbation of insecurityand instability within and between States of the region.In spite of obstructions and misinformation campaigns the Islamic Republic of Iran has continued to articulate andpursue initiatives and measures aimed at fostering greaterregional confidence; enhancing respect for principles ofinternational law; bringing about transparency in armamentsand reduction of military spending; creating zones free fromweapons of mass destruction; strengthening peace andsecurity through persistent endeavours to encourage andfacilitate understanding and conciliation; and consolidatingeconomic cooperation.In Central Asia and the Caucasus  cognizant of thereligious  cultural  historical and commercial bonds thatexist among member States of the Economic CooperationOrganization  the Islamic Republic of Iran has tried inearnest to expand areas of cooperation among memberStates of that important regional organization. Theexpansion of transportation networks  including the revivalof the Silk Road  provides the possibility for a dramaticincrease in the volume of trade not only among memberStates but also between them and other countries of Europe East Asia and the Persian Gulf.Regarding Afghanistan  in pursuance of our mediationand in view of the fact that the return to peace and stabilitythere requires all States  particularly those in the region  touse their influence in order to convince the warring factionsto stop the vicious cycle of fratricide  we plan to convenea regional conference next month in Tehran  with theparticipation of regional foreign ministers andrepresentatives of the United Nations and the Organizationof the Islamic Conference.As regards the crisis in Tajikistan  we have used everymeans available to us to bring the positions of the partiesto the conflict closer to each other  in the strong belief thatthese differences cannot be settled through force or bymilitary means. Considering the consequences of theexpansion of the conflict  more coordination andcooperation among regional States and between them andthe United Nations are imperative.In Karabakh  we welcome the establishment andcontinuation of the ceasefire and believe that this conflictcan only be resolved through negotiations  withdrawalfrom occupied territories and the return of refugees totheir homelands. The Islamic Republic of Iran  enjoyingfriendly relations with both Armenia and Azerbaijan  isprepared to continue its efforts towards the resolution ofthis conflict in cooperation with other States in the region.In northern Iraq  the policy of the Islamic Republicof Iran has always been founded on maintaining thesecurity of our border areas and the prevention of terroristinfiltration  coupled with consistent emphasis on andrespect for Iraq’s sovereignty and territorial integrity aswell as on the prevention of tension and conflict betweenvarious Iraqi Kurdish factions. Regrettably  obstructionistand monopolistic tendencies  as well as self-servinginterventions and indifference  have resulted in a gravehumanitarian nightmare and the influx of hundreds ofthousands of innocent refugees across Iran’s borders.As a cornerstone of its foreign policy  Iran hasalways pursued the promotion and strengthening of peaceand understanding not only in the region but also in theworld at large. During the recent visit of the President ofthe Islamic Republic of Iran to Africa  our efforts to bringabout reconciliation between Sudan and Uganda led to thesignature of a memorandum of peace between the twoneighbouring States and we hope that  with everyone’scooperation and understanding  a more lasting peace canbe attained.Our world today  more than at any other time  needsand deserves morality  security  mutual respect andconfidence  the rule of law  the participation of all andcollective cooperation for human development. The newinternational totalitarianism  notwithstanding its deceptivefacade  is inherently antithetical to these values andconstitutes the very negation of the recent achievementsof human society. The progressive evolution of theinternational community can be achieved not by replacingdomestic dictators with international tyranny  but onlythrough a collective endeavour to achieve common humanideals and aspirations  including  inter alia  understanding28through respect for holy values and mutual tolerance for thecultures and beliefs of others; collective participation andcooperation in the resolution of international issues withina free  democratic and transparent decision-making process;security through the rule of law and practical commitmentto international norms and obligations; and the re-directionof energies and resources from coercion and the arms raceto universal respect for human rights and humandevelopment in all of its cultural  moral  social  politicaland economic dimensions."
"79",3345,"IRQ",51,1996,"﻿Itgives me great pleasure to begin my statement bycongratulating Mr. Razali Ismail on his election to theoffice of President of the General Assembly at its fifty-first session.I am quite confident that his extensive experienceand competence will definitely contribute to thesuccessful outcome of this session. I should like to assurehim that we are keen to cooperate with him and supporthis efforts to bring the proceedings of this session of theGeneral Assembly to a successful conclusion.In recent weeks  Iraq has been the focus ofworldwide attention and interest because of the Americanmissile attacks to which it has been subjected and theintensive American military build-up that followed inpreparation for a large-scale military aggression on thepretext that Iraq violated Security Council resolutions.I would like here to describe our views on theseevents. Iraq has acted in no way contrary to the Charteror Security Council resolutions or to justify an Americanmilitary aggression against it. What Iraq did was to moveits forces on its own territories and within itsinternationally recognized borders at the request of one ofthe main Iraqi Kurdish factions in order to repel amilitary aggression committed by another faction inalliance with a neighbouring foreign country. This actionof the Iraqi Government falls within the sovereignty ofIraq over its own territories and in the context of its dutyto defend its own people and repel any foreign aggressionagainst them. This is a right guaranteed by allinternational covenants and laws. It is also a basicresponsibility of the Government of any country.The operation was limited  swift and carried outwithout the loss of human lives. This has been attested toby all observers  including officials of United Nationsagencies who were working in northern Iraq. T h i soperation put an end to the state of civil war  in-fighting chaos and insecurity in northern Iraq and restored peaceand stability to that region. The United States  however tried to exploit these developments and to use them as apretext to carry out missile attacks against Iraq anddestroy a number of civilian installations  leaving manymartyrs and wounded civilians in its wake.20The United States Administration was not satisfiedwith its military aggression against Iraq. The United StatesPresident openly announced  on 3 September 1996  hisdecision to expand the no-fly zone in southern Iraq  whichhad been imposed by the United States in 1992  from the32nd parallel to the 33rd parallel. The imposition of no-flyzones in Iraqi airspace is a use of armed force in violationof the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq. It was aunilateral decision that had nothing to do with the UnitedNations nor with Security Council resolutions on Iraq. Thisfact was confirmed by the official spokesman of the UnitedNations on 7 January 1993  when he said that theimposition of the no-fly zone in southern Iraq was notbased on any Security Council resolution.The spokesman of the French Foreign Ministryannounced on 2 September 1996 that:“There is no United Nations or the Security Councilprovision defining the basis for a no-fly zone north ofthe 36th parallel or south of the 32nd parallel. Thedecision to establish these zones is a quadrilateraldecision by France  the United States  Britain andTurkey. There is no provision by the United Nationsdefining these zones.”As the Permanent Representative of Russia to theUnited Nations pointed out on 5 September 1996:“This no-fly zone  from its inception  was not basedon any international legal foundation.”The Arab and world reaction to the aggressive actionsof the United States has been one of rejection andcondemnation. The whole world now knows that theimposition of the no-fly zones in Iraq is neither legitimatenor legal and constitutes an ongoing aggression againstIraq. It must cease.From the beginning  Iraq has been very clear inrejecting the so-called no-fly zones unilaterally imposed byAmerica and some of its allies. America and Britaininsisted on expanding this no-fly zone and claimed that itsaim  as declared by the highest officials in the United StatesAdministration  was to protect United States strategicinterests in the region. I wonder: Is a State entitled forciblyto impose such a situation on another independent State also a United Nations Member  on the pretext of protectingits strategic interests? Such acts would cause the law of thejungle to prevail in international relations over the law ofthe Charter.We demand that the United Nations  the GeneralAssembly and the Security Council reject this logic —which is based neither on international legitimacy nor onthe authorization of the Security Council itself — andrelieve our country of this injustice. None of theallegations and pretexts put forward by the United Statesto justify its attacks and military build-up against Iraqhave any justification in law  fact or legitimacy. Theyshould be deplored and condemned.I would like here to express the gratitude of thepeople of Iraq for the Arab and world reaction to thisaggression and the acts that followed  which were aimedat violating Iraq’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.No one here is unaware of the suffering of the Iraqipeople as a result of the total blockade imposed on them which has prevented them from satisfying their basichuman needs for more than six years. Conditions in Iraqhave reached such an extreme that it has becomeimpossible for the United Nations to maintain the silenceimposed on it by one party’s will  especially whenhumanitarian organizations and United Nations agencieshave loudly warned of the serious consequences and harmof continuing the total blockade of Iraq. Infant mortalityrates have soared for lack of food and medicine. Diseaseis rampant. The health  education and environmentalsectors have deteriorated. There have also been majoreffects and regression in other humanitarian fields  in thegrowth and development of which Iraq had been apioneer among third-world countries.However  the United States of America  which hasbeen shedding crocodile tears over the humanitarianconditions of the Iraqi people and their need for food andmedicine  stands today publicly and blatantly against thelegal  balanced and proper implementation of thememorandum of understanding on the “oil for food”formula arrived at by Iraq and the United NationsSecretariat on 20 May 1995.While the professional and diplomatic dialoguebetween Iraq and the United Nations Secretariat managedto reach agreements satisfactory to both sides  the UnitedStates tried to put all kinds of hurdles in the way of thenegotiations at each phase  with a view to delaying thefinalization of the memorandum of understanding. Thenit started to set up road blocks  hindering the actualimplementation of the memorandum’s provisions in theframework of the sanctions committees and in thecompletion of the administrative arrangements needed forsuch implementation.21I would like here to provide some statistics todemonstrate the magnitude of the obstacles the UnitedStates threw up to the process of drafting the memorandumof understanding. It is well known that it took 50 workingmeetings to complete the memorandum — 50 workingmeetings — from 6 February to 20 May 1996. In thecourse of this process  the United States presented 29amendments to the provisions of the memorandum agreedupon with the United Nations Secretariat during thenegotiations. Although Security Council resolution 986(1995) provides for accelerated procedures to implementagreements  it took 80 days to establish the said procedures.During this period  28 informal meetings were held withexperts from the French and German missions; there werefive formal meetings  at which the procedures weresupposed to have been quickly completed and adopted. TheUnited States  however  delayed that adoption for threemore weeks. The United States remains to this day the onlyparty blocking the implementation of the memorandum ofunderstanding  and it does so for political reasons thatcompletely contradict its own allegations that the purposeof resolution 986 (1995) is purely humanitarian.Because of United States pressure and interference  theSecretary-General has so far been unable to implement thememorandum of understanding. This is evidenced by thefact that discussion on the implementation of a six-monthplan to provide food and medicine to the Iraqi people hastaken seven months. It is not yet complete because ofcontinuous United States interference and derailing of theprocess to implement this memorandum. We believe thatthese acts should cease and that the United NationsSecretariat and Iraq should be allowed to implement thememorandum as soon as possible and without furtherinterference.The Iraqi people want to be able to satisfy their ownneeds  using their own capabilities and financial means.They seek the lifting of restrictions whose sole aim is tostarve them and wound their honour and pride. However like the people of Iraq  a proud people more than 6 000years old that has given birth to human civilizations  willnot kneel before any threat nor surrender its sovereigntyand pride to those whose only aim is hegemony over thewealth of peoples and things sacred to them. Iraq is onlydemanding its right — guaranteed by all internationalcovenants and customs and Security Council resolutions —since all the obligations imposed on Iraq have been carriedout and all the reasons for the imposition of these unjustsanctions have been removed.Iraq has fulfilled all its obligations under SecurityCouncil resolutions in spite of the injustice they involved.While these same resolutions place correspondingobligations on the Security Council  we have seen nomovement by the Council to meet them. We feel  rather that the Council has abdicated its powers of control andmonitoring of the implementation of its resolutions. Itassigned that task to the Special Commission(UNSCOM)  which it entrusted with the implementationof section C of resolution 687 (1991) and gave soleresponsibility to decide whether Iraq has carried out all itsobligations and deserves to have the sanctions lifted.UNSCOM has been working throughout Iraq fornearly six years. It has sent 373 inspection teams comprising a total of 3 754 international inspectors  inaddition to its established staff located in Baghdad  whichis made up of more than 90 officials. The Commissionuses the most up-to-date scientific and technologicalmeans and methods  which should have enabled it toaccomplish its mission and verify the results of its work.Is it conceivable that this Commission has been unable toaccomplish its mission to date? Would anybody ask theExecutive Chairman of UNSCOM what has beenaccomplished and what remains to be done? Is itconceivable that UNSCOM has not yet been able todestroy the weapons of mass destruction once owned byIraq? What has this huge army of inspectors been doingall this time? They did not come to Iraq for a vacation. Isit true that the documents and equipment which theCommission alleges to remain but has been unable to findconstitute a threat to international peace and security andrequire the withholding of its recommendation that thesanctions against Iraq be lifted  even partially?Iraq has fulfilled all its substantive obligations withregard to the implementation of section C of resolution687 (1991) on the elimination of prohibited weapons. Iwould like to reaffirm from this rostrum  on behalf of myGovernment  that Iraq has retained no prohibitedweapons  components of such weapons or documentsrelated thereto. What UNSCOM has been saying aboutIraq’s concealment of prohibited weapons  components ofsuch weapons or documents related thereto is based onmere suspicion unsupported by material evidence. Thosesuspicions emanate from American and Britishintelligence services and their agents.Iraq has asked UNSCOM to address these suspicionsin a practical  objective and apolitical manner. UNSCOMis not a political body to be influenced by the politicalgoals of any one country. It is  rather  a technical22Commission obliged to carry out its tasks in a technical andscientific manner free from political conflicts andantagonistic positions. We have witnessed in our dealingswith UNSCOM  however  that it tends to act out of politicalconsiderations rather than on the basis of technical andscientific facts.My country demands that the permanent members ofthe Security Council — including the Arab Republic ofEgypt  the Arab representative on the Council and one ofthe largest countries of the Middle East genuinely interestedin seeing the region free from weapons of mass destruction— participate directly in the work and activities ofUNSCOM and in the evaluation of its work and finalconclusions. We are quite certain that  if this participationis carried out quickly and scrupulously  the conclusion willbe reached  supported by evidence and convincingarguments  that the substantive issues in this file have beenresolved as required by resolution 687 (1991) and that it isnow time for the implementation of paragraph 22 of thesaid resolution.We wish to point out that our most recent experiencewith work carried out under the auspices of the UnitedNations has proven that there is a problem with theOrganization’s structure. This problem is the largeimbalance that exists between rights and obligations  inaddition to the prevalence of the logic of force  which isnot in the provisions of the Charter. The machinery of theinternational Organization has been used as a tool toimplement the foreign policy of certain international super-Powers and to divert the United Nations  particularly theSecurity Council  from its natural path towards one thatclearly contradicts the letter and spirit of the Charter which as the organizing document of this Organization  forms theconstitutional and legal basis upon which the UnitedNations must rely in all its practices.The provisions of the Charter dictate that the SecurityCouncil shall act in accordance with these purposes andprinciples when discharging its duties in the maintenance ofinternational peace and security and in adopting itsresolutions  whose content and implementation shouldconform to the principles of justice and international law.There are restrictions that the Council should abide bywhen adopting its resolutions  which should accord with thepurposes and principles of the Organization  so thatMember States are able to fulfil their obligation to acceptand carry out the decisions of the Security Councilresolutions in accordance with Article 25 of the Charter.The Security Council is not a world Government endowedwith the power of legislation and detailed implementationbeyond the letter and spirit of the Charter. It is  rather  aUnited Nations organ that must abide by the legal normswhich constitute the legal basis for internationallegitimacy  embodied in every provision of the Charter ofthe United Nations.Believing in the principle of interdependence and inthe common interests of all the peoples of the Earth based on the sovereignty  independence and commonconcerns of States  Iraq has contributed and continues tocontribute to the strengthening of the relations and valuesof multilateral international action. The poor countries ofthe southern hemisphere are facing a series of attempts tomarginalize  isolate and prevent them from keeping pacewith scientific and economic developments. Theseattempts include raising trade and political barriers tohinder these countries’ acquisition of technology and theirchances of scientific progress  thereby subjecting themwilly-nilly to an economic machinery that furthers onlythe interests of the large industrial Powers or the richcountries of the North. As President Saddam Husseinpointed out in his speech on Iraq’s National Day last July the battle of the developing countries is the battle of thesouthern hemisphere for freedom  independence development  prosperity and the enjoyment of rights andjustice.President Saddam Hussein also pointed out that theUnited States of America and other international Powershave promulgated slogans publicly calling upon thecountries of the South to develop their capabilities andpotential  allegedly in order to bale themselves out fromunderdevelopment  poverty and deprivation. But whenIraq developed its capabilities and potential and used thisdevelopment and its oil wealth to further its nationaldevelopment and advancement and to enhance Iraqis’abilities and qualifications  the people responsible for thebanners and slogans mobilized  under United Statesleadership  all the forces of evil against Iraq and attackedit with the bombs  missiles and armies of the 30-nationaggression in order to destroy my country’s infrastructureand one of the new pillars of development among thecountries of the South.This places on the United Nations a large andhistoric obligation to shoulder the responsibilitiesentrusted to it by the Charter and to ensure the rights ofall peoples and countries to peace  development andeconomic prosperity. The United Nations must be  as itsfounding fathers wanted it to be  the internationalinstrument for the economic and social advancement ofall peoples  rather than an instrument in the hands of a23certain Power that uses it to impose its hegemony on theworld by force and blackmail.In conclusion  I would like to express my country’sfirm belief that the United Nations  through the strenuousefforts of its working groups on the reform of its structureand methods of work  and thanks to the good will of manyof its Members  will in the near future again approach itstrue potential and capabilities to reject hegemony over itand to accomplish the goals and purposes of its Charter inconformity with international legitimacy and in the interestof the welfare and happiness of all mankind."
"80",3392,"ISL",51,1996,"﻿May I congratulate you Sir  on your election to the presidency of the fifty-firstsession of the General Assembly and pledge to you the fullsupport of my delegation.During the past fiftieth-anniversary year  the StatesMembers of the United Nations have reaffirmed theirsupport for the fundamental purposes and principles of theOrganization. The momentum created by the anniversarymust now be used to adapt the Organization to newrealities. To this end  both structural and financial reformsmust be undertaken  setting priorities and reallocatinglimited resources. But the point of the exercise must not besimple cost-cutting. What we need above all is a stronger not a weaker  Organization  better capable of dealing withthe enormous global challenges of the twenty-first century.There is no alternative to the United Nations. Thefurther evolution of the Organization is therefore inevitable.But the Organization will not evolve in a commonlyacceptable direction under duress. Agreement on andimplementation of necessary reforms will only be achievedin a spirit of dialogue and accommodation.This applies not least to the ongoing work to adaptthe Security Council. Changes in its composition andworking methods should remain a priority. The Councilmust better reflect political and economic realities in arapidly changing world. Its continued effectivenessdepends on a constructive contribution by all its members as well as on equitable representation and manageablesize. There should be a geographically balanced expansionof seats in both the permanent and non-permanentcategories  including permanent seats for Germany andJapan. We should ensure that small and medium-sizedStates have the possibility to be represented in theCouncil.The United Nations system must be strengthenedfurther in the fields of economic and social policy anddevelopment. The revitalization of the Economic andSocial Council is important if the Council is to serve asan important venue for coordination and policy-making onissues which affect our daily existence. Iceland is acandidate for election to the Economic and Social Councilfor the next term and is prepared to contributeconstructively to the work of the Council and to thedebate on its future.The signing of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-BanTreaty (CTBT) this week will be remembered as animportant step towards limiting the nuclear-arms race andsetting us on the path of genuine nuclear disarmament. Iwould like to urge Member countries to sign and ratify theTreaty as soon as possible.The proliferation of nuclear and other weapons ofmass destruction is of continuous concern to theinternational community. Unconditional and universaladherence to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of NuclearWeapons (NPT)  the chemical weapons and biologicalweapons Conventions  and now the ComprehensiveNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty is a critical step towardseliminating weapons that threaten life on our planet.But the horrors associated with weapons of massdestruction must not blind us to the widespread sufferingcaused by increasingly destructive conventional arms.Landmines especially are a growing menace indiscriminately maiming and killing innocents no less thancombatants. Iceland strongly supports a comprehensive banon the use  production and export of anti-personnellandmines.In the aftermath of the cold war  it has becomeincreasingly clear how prolonged regional conflicts canhave serious international implications. Events in Iraq areonly the most recent example. Such conflicts need to beaddressed in a comprehensive manner by the UnitedNations. In addition to the important function of theSecurity Council  the wider United Nations system shouldbe employed more actively to prevent armed conflicts aswell as to assist in the reconstruction of societies emergingfrom war. Vigilance towards threats or acts of aggressionwhich can erode regional or international stability is anecessary part of such preventive activity. Internationalterrorism is aggression by unconventional means. Itsvictims are mainly civilians. The use or sanction ofterrorism by individual States is unacceptable. The actionof the international community should properly reflect theuniversal abhorrence of alliances between terrorists andindividual States.The sinister scheming of terrorists and organized crimeis of growing concern  not least since it is frequently basedon illicit drug trafficking. The United Nations can do muchto enhance international cooperation in crime preventionand in the suppression of drug trafficking across nationalboundaries. Iceland supports the holding of a specialsession of the General Assembly in 1998 devoted to drugcontrol.The international community must move swiftly toenhance respect for relevant human rights instruments inareas of conflict. The establishment of international warcrimes tribunals is a step in the right direction  providedthey receive the cooperation necessary to fulfil theirmandate from all parties concerned.Through a series of international conferences  theOrganization has  during the past few years  addressed themost important issues facing humankind. Theseconferences have highlighted both the enormity of ourtask and the complex interrelationship between thevarious global issues we are often called upon to dealwith  be they absolute poverty  environmental degradation overpopulation  human rights abuses or social injustice.Having concluded this unprecedented series ofconferences with the second United Nations Conferenceon Human Settlements in Istanbul last June  we owe it tofuture generations to join hands and spare no effort toimplement the decisions reached.Universal human rights are the foundation on whichwe base the work of the United Nations. This includes thesafeguarding of gender equality and the rights of the mostvulnerable groups in society: the poor and the disabled.Children are increasingly the target of atrocities in warand of human rights violations. Six years after the WorldSummit for Children we still must do a better job ofhonouring our commitments to children. In this context Iceland welcomes in particular the recommendations ofthe Stockholm World Congress against CommercialSexual Exploitation of Children and wishes to see themfollowed up as soon as possible.Hunger and malnutrition are shameful phenomena onthe eve of the twenty-first century. With the resources atits disposal  the international community should be ableto provide food security for the whole of mankind. Theforthcoming World Food Summit will hopefully secure acommitment at the highest political level to rapidlyachieve this objective.As a country owing its survival and prosperity to theharvesting of living marine resources  Iceland hasconsistently underlined the potential of the oceans as amajor source of nutrition. Icelandic fisheries havedeveloped experience and technology which could benefitothers. The Government of Iceland is prepared tofacilitate international cooperation in this field. Icelandhas contributed actively to the establishment ofinternational law governing the protection and sustainableutilization of the oceans. The United Nations Conventionon the Law of the Sea has already proven to be a historicsuccess in the field of international law and remainsamong the greatest achievements of the United Nations.2The seas and the ocean floors are the depositories ofenormous resources. The agreement of the internationalcommunity on an extensive legal framework on this subjectis therefore a major accomplishment. The Convention offersthe prospect of resolving serious conflicts on the uses of theseas which could be detrimental to internationalcooperation. The Convention has already provided the basisfor further agreements  such as the recently concludedAgreement relating to the Conservation and Management ofStraddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks.Iceland has actively participated in the adoption of theGlobal Programme of Action for the Protection of theMarine Environment from Land-based Activities. Pollutionof this sort is responsible for over 80 per cent of all marinepollution. In order to facilitate the implementation of theProgramme  a draft resolution on institutional arrangementswill be addressed by the General Assembly at this session.However  major challenges remain. Controlling the useof persistent organic pollutants needs to be addressed.Iceland welcomes the proposal put forward within theUnited Nations Environment Programme to establish aninternational committee in 1997 with the aim of reaching aglobal agreement on this question.This year  Iceland celebrates the fiftieth anniversary ofits membership in the United Nations. We have stronglyemphasized constructive participation. This reflects ourbelief in the importance of multilateral cooperation forsmaller States and  in particular  in the hopes andaspirations attached to the world Organization.The United Nations is ideally capable of achievementsin specific areas which are beyond the reach of national orregional authorities. However  it will never attain thecapacity to meet all expectations. As Member States debatereforms  I would like to emphasize the importance ofsetting priorities and making them well known. The shapingof a new United Nations suited for the twenty-first centurymust be complemented by vigorous information efforts withthe aim of ensuring continued public confidence andsupport."
"81",3439,"ISR",51,1996,"﻿Allowme first  Sir  to congratulate Mr. Razali Ismail on hisunanimous election as President of the General Assemblyat its fifty-first session and to wish him every success. Iwould also like to thank his predecessor  Mr. Diogo Freitasdo Amaral  for the outstanding manner in which he carriedout his duties.The succession of Governments  which is a definingprinciple of Israeli democracy  has recently brought topower a new Government in Israel. A section of theinternational community has deemed this democratic Israelichoice impertinent  suggesting that it would work againstregional peace. In response to this prejudice I would like tomake a simple statement: Israel is united in its quest forpeace. It is not a question of good people and peace-seekerson one side and mischief-makers and people who rejectpeace on the other. In Israel  those on the left and rightconverge in their quest for peace  their sensibilities anddifferences notwithstanding.I wish to raise the recent history of the Israeli-Arabpeace process in order to dispel any ambiguity regardingthe practice of peace in Israel and to show that the newmajority cannot be disqualified from efforts to achievepeace. The peace between Israel and Egypt is a foundinglandmark of coexistence between Israelis and Arabs. TheMadrid Conference  to which I had the honour ofcontributing  also bears the special stamp of the pioneers ofpeace  to whose achievements the new majority in Israel arethe direct heirs.The firm commitment of the Netanyahu Governmentwith respect to the Oslo accords is also closely tied to thepeace process  which our immediate neighbours  Egypt andJordan  helped to shape. However  my Government’s swiftengagement in the peace process has been minimized reduced and distorted. The meetings that the PrimeMinister and the Minister of Defence of the State of Israeland I have had with the Chairman of the PalestinianAuthority have been met with sarcasm and given onlysecondary importance. Those meetings dealt preciselywith the substance and the content of peace. Theyinitiated the ways and means necessary for theachievement of peace. They amplified the resonance ofthe Oslo accords and extended mutual Israeli-Palestinianrecognition to new sections of society and Israeli politicalclasses. It is Israel’s determination to reach peaceaccording to the policies and fundamental guidelines ofthe new Government.On its road to peace  the Government of Israel isguided by several principles  which I would like toexpound. For us  security is neither an obsession nor ablind belief. It touches upon our very existence in aregion where  unfortunately  threats and instability stillrage. Security must be the cornerstone in the architectureof peace. It cannot  under any circumstances  tag alongbehind a process in which terrorism and violence have notyet spoken their last word.Negotiations themselves  through their joint creativeenergies  allow us to control the dangers and drifts. Thebattle against terrorism and its infrastructures and itssources of financing and assistance is not only for us tofight. We solemnly call upon the United Nationsrelentlessly to pursue active cooperation in the struggleagainst terrorism and in condemning it unequivocally. Itis imperative to preserve the Israeli-Palestinian peaceprocess free from violence.I have just returned from the Washington summit held at the initiative of President Clinton. On behalf ofthe Government and the people of Israel  I wish  from thisrostrum  to thank the President and the Secretary of Stateof the United States for their exemplary contribution topeace by bringing the parties together and for theirprofound commitment to reinvigorating the peace process.In this respect the role and contribution of the UnitedStates remain of great importance.On Sunday the Israeli and Palestinian teams willconvene again in an attempt to resolve their differences inrespect of the various agreements. We are responsible toour people and to our whole region in this matter. Wemust therefore display good faith and mutualunderstanding in order to fulfil our mission  and to sendout the message of stable peace and lasting security.12The Washington summit reconfirmed the principlesand guidelines for the negotiations. I associate myselfwholeheartedly with President Clinton’s statement that face-to-face negotiations in a constructive atmosphere are thekey to resolving problems. A future free of hostility and therenunciation of violence: these represent the very basis ofmutual efforts for peace.The choice is in our hands. Will we opt forcooperation  progress  real peace and security? Or will werevert to the dark days of conflict  confrontation andviolence  thereby putting an end to all hope? For its part Israel has chosen hope.Another major principle in our search for peace is thewill of the partners to allow a tangible peace to exist.Regional cooperation is a critical factor in ensuring peaceand stability. Israel entertains no dreams of economichegemony; it wishes to play its fair role in the creation ofregional cooperation. This is a basic principle ofnormalization. Peace and normalization are one andindivisible. Consequently  if we are to follow the logic ofpeace and dialogue  we cannot risk having normalizationtaken hostage and brought to a halt.Israel makes no secret that normalization of itsrelations with the Arab world must be fully implemented.This means comprehensive political and economic relations and the broadest possible intellectual  cultural and spiritualacceptance. Some of our neighbours still view Israel as abody foreign to the region. Normalization must eraseforever the residue of this ideological negation.Normalization is the indispensable cement for keepingtogether the edifice of peace.One of our immediate goals is the resumption ofnegotiations with Syria on the basis of the Madridprinciples  which inaugurated the dialogue between the twocountries. We recognize Syria’s important role in theestablishment of lasting peace in our region. From thisrostrum  we call upon President Al-Assad to resumenegotiations.As to Lebanon  we have no territorial disputes withLebanon. We are committed to its sovereignty. Lebanoncan be fertile ground for the restoration of confidence andthe building of peace.Egypt and its President  Mr. Hosni Mubarak  are ourpartners in peace. They are the authors and actors that havealways been engaged in all stages of the peace process.Jordan is unquestionably a decisive factor in thebuilding of peace in our region. A man of peace anddialogue  His Majesty King Hussein has activelysupported the peace process and has provided a vitalguarantee of continuity. The Washington summit enjoyedhis complete support.On the long path to peace  the country of Morocco the country of my birth and family roots  has alwayswalked and illuminated the path of Israeli-Arabreconciliation. The vision displayed by His Majesty KingHassan II has left its distinctive mark on the entire Arab-Israeli dialogue. The Moroccan King will continue hisessential role and breathe into peace the remarkableinspiration of his solidarity.I would like to pay tribute also to the active supportof Tunisia. Oman  Qatar and  more recently  Mauritaniahave all helped to consolidate peace efforts.The peace process has benefitted from theconsiderable support of the co-sponsors  the United Statesand Russia  and from the active and positive contributionof the European Union and Norway and of Powers suchas Japan and Canada.Once again  I wish solemnly to reaffirm Israel’sirreversible commitment and determination to pursue thepath of peace.Since the dawn of history our region has been ameeting point of diverse civilizations and cultures  avibrant wellspring of progress for all of humanity. At thecrossroads of continents and countries  the Middle Eastmust  in times of peace  discover again the genius of thisplace and the richness of its edifying civilizations. Arabsand Jews must pool their knowledge and wisdom toregenerate their vocation as the promoters of life andhumanity.Through international cooperation  Israel is sharingwith young countries from Africa to Asia  from LatinAmerica to China  its achievements and assets in thefields of agriculture  health and science.We hope that the day will come when a regionalsecurity system will be established in the Middle East toprovide a cooperative multilateral response to all securityproblems. The advantage of this regional approach is thatit is based on direct negotiations between the States of theregion. The first stage is to build confidence  andthereafter we must put arms control and disarmament13mechanisms into place. For this reason  Israel welcomed theestablishment of the Arms Control and Regional SecurityWorking Group as part of the multilateral talks. We hopethat in the future this framework will encompass all Statesof the Middle East.Israel’s position is defined by a dual mandate: to setambitious objectives  and to pursue them pragmatically andrealistically. After peace and reconciliation have beenestablished among all the States of the region  Israel willendeavour to establish in the Middle East a zone free ofchemical  biological and nuclear weapons as well asballistic missiles. This demilitarization will be subjected torigorous verification.Negotiations to establish such a zone will commencefollowing the signing of bilateral peace accords betweenIsrael and all the countries of the region. In the meantimeIsrael will implement confidence-building measures thatwill increase openness and transparency and  thereby  makea contribution to easing tensions and preventing all armedconflict.We generally prefer regional security arrangements.However  Israel is in favour of the implementation ofcertain aspects of international mechanisms for arms controland disarmament where appropriate. Accordingly  Israelsigned the Convention on conventional weapons andadopted a moratorium on the manufacture and export ofanti-personnel landmines. It has also signed the Treatyagainst the use of chemical weapons and now theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. Israel willconsider ratification of that Treaty depending upondevelopments in the region  particularly the adoption of thatTreaty by the major countries.Israel has thus demonstrated its determination to beinvolved  whenever possible  in the efforts of theinternational community to prevent the spread ofconventional and non-conventional weapons.Israel strongly desires to be an active and fully-fledgedmember of the family of nations represented in thisOrganization. We note with regret and deep disappointmentthat the question of our membership in a regional group hasstill not been resolved. Israel is thus deprived of the rightavailable to all States Members of the United Nations toparticipate on an equal footing in all its activities. Thisimpairs the principle of equality among sovereign nationsunder the Charter of the United Nations. I hope that thisinjustice will be rectified and that Israel will finally be ableto act within this Organization on the same footing as allother Member States.It is with the subject of Jerusalem  whose very nameis invoked in so many prayers for peace  that I wish toconclude. Jerusalem is the cradle of the three greatreligions. We reaffirm this status daily by respecting andensuring total freedom of worship and spiritual expressionfor all believers. It is an entirely shared religious realityto which Israel has made a profound contribution.Jerusalem  the horizon of our dreams and prayers has throughout our exile and dispersions constituted thesummit of our collective being. Capital of Israel  both inancient and modern times  never has Jerusalem been thecapital of any country other than Israel.Rarely if ever has any sovereign State been deniedthe right to freely determine its capital. Israel  the peopleof peace restored to sovereignty after 2 000 years of exile has returned to the city of peace  Yerushalayim:Jerusalem. Thereby it demonstrates its unswervingdevotion to its ancestral capital to renew its psalm ofpeace: “Pray for the peace of Jerusalem”. We shalltirelessly dedicate all our efforts to that search for peace."
"82",3486,"ITA",51,1996,"﻿On behalf of Italy  I am pleased toexpress to you  Sir  my warmest congratulations on yourelection to the presidency of this session of the GeneralAssembly. Your extensive and widely recognizedknowledge and experience of the activities and functionsof the United Nations is the best guarantee of yoursuccess. At the same time  allow me to sincerely thankyour predecessor  Professor Diogo Freitas do Amaral ofPortugal  who so ably led the historic fiftieth session ofthe General Assembly.In addition  I should like to express our greatappreciation for the inspiring role and constructiveleadership of the United Nations provided by Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali.Italy shares and fully supports the statement madebefore the General Assembly on Tuesday by the DeputyPrime Minister and Foreign Minister of Ireland on behalfof the European Union. At the special commemorativemeeting for the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations there was a solemn reaffirmation of the need for theUnited Nations to implement significant changes to keepstep with the new global realities. Italy believes that thetime has come to translate ideas into urgently neededreforms. Let me briefly address them.The General Assembly is the most representativeexpression of the values of our Organization. Therefore we believe that the General Assembly must increasinglyreflect the opinions of our peoples and become moredemocratic through direct links to the institutional realities4of its Member States. The Italian delegation to the GeneralAssembly  for example  includes representatives of both theSenate and the Chamber of Deputies of our Parliament which helps our political forces to have a fuller appreciationfor the role and activities of the United Nations. We hopethat this practice  which is also followed by certain othercountries  becomes more widespread and consolidated.The General Assembly’s subsidiary bodies should besimplified  merging some committees while streamlining theagenda. Greater transparency is needed in relations betweenthe General Assembly  the Security Council and theSecretariat.At the same time  we believe that the Secretariatshould be restructured  so as to organize resources andfunctions around two focal points: on the one hand  peaceand security; and on the other  democracy and development.In this context  Italy proposes that the three economic andsocial departments of the United Nations Secretariat shouldbe merged into a single entity under the leadership of aDeputy Secretary-General  who would also act as theExecutive Secretary of the Economic and Social Council.Italy is actively committed to Security Council reformand has presented a detailed proposal inspired by thefundamental principles of democracy  equitablegeographical representation  efficiency and transparency.Reform should not lead to the establishment of newregimes of privilege  which would diminish rather thanincrease equitable representation on the Council. Last April in his address before the General Assembly  the Presidentof the Republic of Italy  Oscar Luigi Scalfaro  warned thatstressing the elitist nature of the Council“could widen the gap and thus reduce the interest ofthe excluded  demeaning their political commitment inthe process and perhaps marginalizing them andgiving them the dangerous feeling that they are tokenpresences  mere spectators.” (Official Records of theGeneral Assembly  Fiftieth Session  Plenary Meetings 103rd meeting  p. 3-4)Our goal instead must be to stimulate a greater involvementof all countries  large and small  through a rotationmechanism.The Italian proposal would maintain a central role forthe General Assembly. In fact  it would be up to theGeneral Assembly to decide  on the basis of objectivecriteria  which countries could rotate more frequently. Itwould be up to the General Assembly to elect thesecountries  by a two-thirds majority and by secret ballot  ina truly democratic way. And it would be up to theGeneral Assembly periodically to review the countries inquestion.The Open-ended Working Group on the Question ofEquitable Representation on and Increase in theMembership of the Security Council has found it difficultto reach a consensus. Italy considers its proposal abalanced way of reconciling the new internationalrealities  namely the emergence of countries with notablepolitical and economic capacities — and I include Italyamong them — and the rise in developing countries  afull 132 of which are Member States of the UnitedNations today. However  we are willing to discuss andadhere to a formula that is not inconsistent with thefundamental principles that govern our own proposal.A new generation of peace-keeping has begun. Fromits original role as a force of interposition  peace-keepinghas gradually taken on the broader tasks of pacification support for the process of national reconciliation  andtoday the protection of populations threatened by inter-ethnic conflicts. Italy believes that in confronting thesetasks every Member State should responsibly considermaking  and be prepared to make  larger and morequalified military contingents available to the UnitedNations. Italy is capable of doing its part  as demonstratedin Mozambique and in Bosnia.To make United Nations actions more effective inthis field  Italy proposes the following 10 concretemeasures which would be designed to: involve troop-contributing countries in the decision-making process;conduct annual reviews of the mission  mandate  andmeans of peace-keeping operations; have readilydeployable military forces available as soon as SecurityCouncil decisions are made; create a reliable and unifiedcommand structure for peace-keeping operations; expandlogistical support for peace-keeping operations; prioritizetraining programmes for peace-keeping personnel;improve the financing of peace-keeping operations; fillthe gap between peace-keeping and post-conflict peace-building; entrust certain peace-keeping operations toregional organizations; and  finally  enhance cooperationbetween the United Nations and the Organization ofAfrican Unity (OAU).To go into these points more at length  first of allwe are glad that the Security Council  as suggested byItaly and other countries  has made it a regular practice to5hold consultations with troop-contributing countries beforeadopting decisions on peace-keeping operations. The nextstep is a formal mechanism that guarantees the participationof troop-contributing countries in the decision-makingprocess. In this connection  Italy will lend its full supportto the proposal put forward by the Prime Minister ofNorway  Mrs. Brundtland  for an annual seminar to focuson the three M’s of peace-keeping: Mission  Mandate andMeans.The United Nations must be ready to deal withconflicts where and when they break out  and to this end it must be able to count on readily available military forces as provided for by Article 43 of the Charter of the UnitedNations. We would also support the establishment  assuggested by Canada  of a headquarters module for peace-keeping at the United Nations Secretariat  whosecomposition should respect the principle of equitablegeographical representation.Italy intends to promote specific proposals to expandlogistical support  on the strength of its experience with theUnited Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) and theImplementation Force (IFOR). Already  we have madeavailable the first United Nations logistic base in Brindisi which should be further expanded to ensure efficientresource management for peace-keeping operations and wesuggest a separate allocation in peace-keeping budgets forthe creation of logistic bases.The training of peace-keeping personnel is the duty ofthe United Nations Staff College in Turin  which wascreated on the Secretary-General’s initiative. The Collegeis receiving the maximum support of the ItalianGovernment and will hopefully receive the support of otherMember States as well. Financing of peace-keepingoperations could be improved through a peace-keepingsurcharge for new  frequently rotating Security Councilmembers  as Italy has proposed. This would distribute theburden of the surcharge to a larger number of countries.Another essential component of peace-keeping ishumanitarian assistance during and immediately after aconflict. Between the management of a conflict and post-conflict peace-building there is a gap. To fill just such agap in Central America  Italy designed and funded theDevelopment Progress for Displaced Persons  Refugees andReturnees (PRODERE) programme  which contributedsubstantially to the process of reconciliation. A model effortof the same type is now under way in Mozambique.Closer coordination with regional organizations couldhelp provide the United Nations with the human andmaterial resources it needs. Without detracting from theUnited Nations central role  certain peace-keeping andpeace-enforcement operations should be entrusted toregional organizations or coalitions. A good example ofthis is the success of the North Atlantic TreatyOrganization (NATO) in fulfilling the mandate it wasgiven by the United Nations in the former Yugoslavia where the Organization for Security and Cooperation inEurope has also played an increasing and important role.Italy hopes for growing dialogue between theOrganization of African Unity and the United Nations and a strengthening of the peace-keeping capabilities ofAfrican countries. The OAU must be concretely helped toenhance its mechanism for conflict prevention and crisismanagement. In line with Italy’s traditional support fordemocratic development  we are planning a broad seriesof initiatives in Africa aimed at supporting parliamentaryactivities and strengthening judicial structures andtraining.The United Nations is a global system  and itpursues global objectives. Conflict prevention and thepromotion of peaceful solutions to controversies cannot bepursued solely at the political and military level. Theconditions for peace are found  perhaps primarily  in theeconomic  social and cultural development of peoples.Poverty  underdevelopment  and cultural isolation disruptrelations between countries and thus constitute threats tointernational peace.Through its funds  programmes  and specializedagencies  the United Nations plays a vital role inpreventing these obstacles from jeopardizing peacefulcoexistence. It helps restore the conditions for orderlyglobal development after disruptions caused by internaland international conflicts. Italy appreciates theimportance of both prevention and post-conflictreconstruction  and is determined to strengthen itscollaboration with the United Nations specializedagencies.With this in mind Italy has chosen the UnitedNations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization(UNESCO) as one of the main points of reference for thereconstruction of the city of Mostar. Collaboration withthe cultural agency of the United Nations will also provevaluable in other areas of the former Yugoslavia onprojects to reconstruct prestigious landmarks such as theSarajevo library and historic buildings in Ragusa/6Dubrovnik.The reform process also concerns the economic andsocial fields of the United Nations. The adoption ofresolution 50/227 is a significant step forward  especiallywhere it refers to strengthening the role of the Economicand Social Council. Special attention should be paid to theoperative follow-up to this resolution.The identification of priorities by the United Nations in accordance with changes in international reality  isessential to achieving greater efficiency to serve the bestinterests of the beneficiary countries  as well as those of theUnited Nations itself.During the last five years the United Nations hassponsored a series of global conferences to addresssystematically the key issues facing humanity today. Theupcoming World Food Summit  which will take place inRome from November 13-17 of this year  will close thisimportant cycle. This summit will provide an opportunityto define new strategic objectives for international action inthe field of food security in order to overcome structuralshortages  especially in the nutrition sector  in many regionsof our planet. In preparation  Italy is promoting a jointdevelopment initiative for Angola with the three agriculturalagencies whose headquarters are in Rome.The process of economic globalization and thegrowing interdependence of markets offer enormouseconomic and social growth possibilities. From thisperspective  the concept of global partnership provides foran equitable sharing of responsibilities. The MinisterialMeeting in Singapore is an excellent opportunity to focuson these issues  consolidating the process of tradeliberalization sanctioned by the Uruguay Round andstrengthening the regulatory role of the World TradeOrganization (WTO).Italy is actively participating in the preparation of the1997 special session of the United Nations GeneralAssembly dedicated to the environment. While keeping inmind the results of the Rio Conference and foreseeablefuture scenarios for sustainable development  that sessionshould update the instruments for action and continue tostrive for implementation of Agenda 21. In 1996 significantachievements have been made in the field of disarmament.A major step on the road to nuclear disarmament has ofcourse been taken with the signing of the ComprehensiveNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. In the field of conventionalweapons  an important agreement was reached in Florencelast June on arms control in the former Yugoslavia. Ournext goal should be a cut-off in the production of fissilematerial for military purposes.The Italian Government pledges to renounce onceand for all the production and export of anti-personnelland-mines. We will also initiate the destruction ofexisting devices and promote further restrictions in thehope that such measures will contribute to reaching asolid international understanding and a definitive ban. Tothis end  we propose the prompt opening of internationalnegotiations at the Conference on Disarmament inGeneva.The fundamental role of law in the creation of a newworld order must be upheld. National sovereignty hasnothing to fear from the consolidation of internationallaw. We believe that the cause of peace can only profitfrom the establishment of an international criminal courton violations of international humanitarian law and crimesagainst humanity. Italy is committed to this goal and isready to host a diplomatic conference in 1998 to sanctionthe birth of such a court. Italy is also promoting acampaign for a worldwide moratorium on the applicationof the death penalty.The European Union has constantly emphasized thatfinancial reform is essential to any modernizing of theUnited Nations structure  and we share the ideasexpressed on this subject by the Irish presidency. We areconvinced that financial reform is a prerequisite to theUnited Nations maintaining its crucial function ininternational relations. The role that United NationsMember States intend to play in pursuing the objectivesof the Charter cannot be independent of their specificresponsibility to honour their financial obligations. Wefirmly reiterate the validity of the specific proposal forfinancial reform presented by the European Union underItaly’s presidency during the first half of this year.A formidable task awaits us: to adapt ourOrganization to the needs and the challenges of thetwenty-first century. Italy is prepared to spare no effort inthe pursuit of our common goals."
"83",3532,"JAM",51,1996,"﻿May I  on behalf of thedelegation of Jamaica  convey to Mr. Razali Ismail ourwarmest congratulations on his election as President ofthe fifty-first session of the General Assembly. In sodoing we pay tribute to his country  Malaysia  which islinked to Jamaica by close ties of friendship andcollaboration and which continues to play a prominentrole in international affairs. I would assure him of the fullsupport and cooperation of the Jamaican delegation in thedeliberations on the many important issues before us.I should like to congratulate your predecessor  HisExcellency Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral  for the ablemanner in which he guided the work of the fiftiethsession. Let me also express appreciation to the Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for his untiringefforts to promote peace and development.There are many who  with good reason  approachthis fifty-first session with a sense of despair and deepconcern about the future of the United Nations and thevital mission that it must undertake on behalf of thepeoples of the world. They look back at the promises andthe pledges made during the fiftieth anniversarycelebrations and try to reconcile these lofty messages withthe continuing crisis being faced by this body and thedifficulties confronting the multilateral system.Rather than dwelling on the missed opportunities andthe difficulties that have confronted us  my delegationwould wish for this Assembly to recognize the imperative15need for effective global action in the pursuit of the goalsof international peace and security  economic and socialwell-being  and justice for all. In so doing  we must allreaffirm our commitment to the principles on which theUnited Nations is based. Our Prime Minister  P. J.Patterson  and other world leaders joined in renewing thecollective commitment to these principles at last year’sSpecial Commemorative Meeting.The fundamental goal of the United Nations is theachievement and preservation of international peace andsecurity. We have witnessed in recent times the end of thecold war and the dramatic reduction in East-West tensions.At the same time  we have witnessed the tragic emergenceof horrific levels of ethnic tension  regional instability andintra-State upheavals  which have threatened internationalpeace and security. These have severely tested the mettle ofthe United Nations system and the community of nations asa whole.The challenges to peacemakers and peacekeepers inthis period have been many. We must  today  recognize thesuccesses that have been achieved through combinedmultilateral and regional action in the spirit of the Charter.A functioning multilateral system should work effectivelyto restrain aggression and the exercise of military power.We must resist tendencies towards unilateralism which areunhealthy and negative signs for the international system.We must insist that the established mechanisms for conflictresolution and decision-making in relation to issues ofmultilateral security are upheld.Jamaica and sister nations of the Caribbean joined theinternational community in mounting a United NationsMission in Haiti that brought an end to the wanton violenceand the tragedies at sea that characterized the period ofmilitary dictatorship in that country.The return of democracy has brought renewed hope opportunity and optimism to the people of Haiti. Thesesentiments can be sustained only if we continue to help theGovernment and people of Haiti to overcome the obstaclesthat still confront them in this quest. It is important that theUnited Nations Support Mission in Haiti be given themeans necessary to enable it to meet its objectives. It iseven more critical that the international community commititself to providing the technical and financial resourcesnecessary to assist Haiti to achieve economic and socialdevelopment.The nations of the Caribbean seek to maintain aclimate free of tension and confrontation. We seek thenormalization of relations  which will reduce theatmosphere of uncertainty and the dangers ofconfrontation in the region. We seek this in anatmosphere of respect for sovereign rights and acommitment to the peaceful settlement of disputes. Wereject the extra-territorial application of nationallegislation  which is inconsistent with international law.Within the wider Caribbean  we continue to pursuethe goal of regional integration through the CaribbeanCommunity (CARICOM) and the Association ofCaribbean States. It is our objective to achieve thecreation of a Caribbean zone of peace and cooperation.We are united by a common determination to remove thebarriers that divide us and to protect the precious naturalheritage that we share. For this we have to engage theactive participation of all countries in the region.We wish to commend the efforts of AfricanGovernments and the Organization of African Unity toovercome the grave difficulties that Africa has beenexperiencing. We particularly welcome the initiative fora conference on peace  security and stability in theAfrican Great Lakes region. We can only hope that through a comprehensive approach  lasting solutions canbe found to the situations in Burundi and Rwanda. Wereiterate our strong support for the efforts of theinternational community to implement the United NationsNew Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990sand the United Nations System-wide Special Initiative onAfrica.We are encouraged by recent events in Bosnia andHerzegovina  which have paved the way for elections inthat country  and look forward to the restoration ofstability and a harmonious relationship among its people.We support the position that the Middle East peaceprocess should be consolidated and proceed on the basisof the principles already agreed and accepted by allparties. There should be no turning back. Peace isattainable if the parties approach negotiations in a spiritof accommodation and compromise  and recognize theircommon interest in ensuring stability and mutual respectfor each other’s rights. We hope that the talks  whichbegin today at the invitation of President Clinton  willlead to a speedy agreement among the parties.While the United Nations must focus criticalattention on the crises caused by conflict and violentconfrontation  it must never lose sight of the root cause ofinstability and tension — poverty  deprivation  hunger16and disease. It is in the depth of human misery that theswords of anger and division are most quickly unsheathed.A commitment to the goals of peace and security ismeaningless without a commitment to fostering sustainedeconomic growth and sustainable development  and towaging war on poverty and human misery.The emerging global economic environment gives uscause for both optimism and grave anxiety. Phenomenaleconomic growth in a few countries is contrasted withdecline and stagnation in the majority. An increasinglyaffluent world coexists with a huge and marginalizedunderclass. This polarization is reflected both internally andexternally.A failure to address inequities can and will inevitablylead to what the 1996 Human Development Report sographically describes on page 8 as“a world gargantuan in its excesses and grotesque inits human and economic inequalities.”For many low-income countries that lack adequateaccess to development capital and other resources  officialdevelopment assistance remains a critical but diminishingsource of support. Moreover  the problem of external debtis also a burden for many of these countries. Agreedarrangements have proved inadequate in alleviating debtburdens  and alternate strategies still have to be found.It is against this background that Jamaica continues toinsist that achieving sustained economic growth andsustainable development must remain a priority objective ofthe global agenda. In the series of global conferencesending recently with the Second United Nations Conferenceon Human Settlements (Habitat II)  Governmentsdemonstrated their ability to collaborate in analyzing socio-economic and environmental problems.Taken together  these conferences represent deliberateefforts to define a framework for development cooperationand multilateral commitments. These global forums haveraised the level of awareness of development issues. Weshould now not allow inertia to take over. It is essential therefore  that we honour the commitments and meet theinternationally agreed targets emanating from theseconferences. Their success depends on political will and theprovision of adequate resources to ensure follow-up andimplementation.The 1997 special session devoted to the assessmentand review of the implementation of Agenda 21 and theresults of the 1992 United Nations Conference onEnvironment and Development in Rio will provide anideal opportunity for the international community toassess progress in carrying out the agreed commitments.For small island developing countries  the reviewprocess is of great significance  and we hope it willprovide the momentum fully to implement the BarbadosProgramme of Action.Governments  including my own  have created theirown framework for implementation at the national level.Jamaica has embraced the concept of sustainabledevelopment  and our policies have been oriented towardsachieving these goals.The main challenge faced by small island developingStates is to find the resources to develop a programmethat is designed to reduce the vulnerability of theireconomies and generate economic growth anddevelopment. This envisages a systematic approach to thecategorization of island developing countries byspecialization or socio-economic performance.The Uruguay Round agreements  on which theWorld Trade Organization is founded  provide theframework for a liberalized multilateral trading system.Many developing countries are unlikely to benefit inthe short term from the Uruguay Round agreements.Structurally weak and vulnerable developing countriesrequire favourable arrangements and equitable terms andconditions to enable them to make the necessaryadjustments to participate successfully in world trade.Free trade must never be viewed as an end in itself;it must be a vehicle for development. It is for this reasonthat the World Trade Organization recognizes the need forspecial and differential treatment for developing countriesand waivers for special trading regimes. This must berespected in both letter and spirit.We are of the firm view that no action should betaken to erode our vital interests or remove equitable andlong-standing arrangements that affect the very economicsurvival of some developing countries. In this context  Irefer to the current action by a coalition of powerfulspecial interests with respect to the special terms enjoyedby a number of developing countries through theirarrangements with the European Union. It has been madeabundantly clear that the removal of preferences would17have a serious negative impact on the economies ofJamaica and other Caribbean countries.My delegation therefore calls upon those who wouldseek to use the World Trade Organization as an instrumentto attack the very foundation of the economies of smalldeveloping States to desist from this course of action. Thethoughtless assault upon the Lomé Banana Protocol is ofgreat concern to my country and to sister Caribbean bananaproducers  which stand to suffer economic devastation if theselfish acts of these powerful interests are allowed tosucceed.The trend towards globalization is irreversible  but notall of us are capable of making the adjustments necessaryin the short term to cope with its consequences. The UnitedNations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)has an important role to play in assisting developingcountries to meet the challenges brought about byglobalization and liberalization and to facilitate theirintegration in the world trading system. In this regard  wewelcome the renewed vigour of this body  as exemplifiedat the ninth session of UNCTAD  where Governmentsreaffirmed the relevance of UNCTAD’s mandate as thefocal point for dealing with trade and related developmentissues.It is necessary to examine and assess the UnitedNations system and its capacity to respond to political andhumanitarian emergencies. The United Nations must beginto link peace-keeping and peacemaking in a more coherentand consistent manner. We note the work in this regardtaking place in the Assembly’s Informal Open-endedWorking Group on an Agenda for Peace. We recognize theneed for a rapidly deployable unit and support the efforts toput this in place.An important step was taken in the field ofdisarmament recently with the adoption of theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). Jamaicaregards the CTBT as an incremental step and looks forwardto the next stage  which is the adoption of a programme toachieve the ultimate goal of complete nuclear disarmament.Those States with nuclear capabilities have a responsibilityto carry out their obligations in good faith not only inregard to nuclear testing  but also with respect to non-proliferation.The problem of drug abuse and illicit traffic innarcotics continues to pose a serious threat to society. Theextent of drug abuse and drug trafficking shows that ittranscends national and geographic boundaries. Nationalcommitment and international cooperation are thereforerequired to address this problem. It is against thisbackground that Jamaica strongly supports the conveningof a special session of the General Assembly in 1998 toaddress the illicit trafficking in and use of drugs. At thesame time  we must recognize the impact of relatedcriminal activity  which is spawned by the illicit drugtrade. Of particular concern is the nexus between drugtrafficking and trafficking in arms and high-poweredweapons. We urge those States that are producers of thesearms to be more vigilant in enforcing control over theirdistribution and illegal export.Since we met last year  significant developmentshave occurred with regard to the implementation of theConvention on the Law of the Sea. With the completionof elections to the various institutions of the authority  theInternational Seabed Authority is now operational. Wecongratulate Secretary-General Mr. Satya Nandan on hiselection and express our confidence that his leadershipand guidance will enable the Authority to discharge itsmandate. It is vital that adequate resources be provided inorder to ensure that the Authority becomes firmlyestablished.We also take this opportunity to welcome thehistoric election on 1 August of the members of theInternational Tribunal for the Law of the Sea. We lookforward to the inauguration of the Tribunal in its host cityof Hamburg later this month. This will be anotherlandmark in the process of the implementation of theConvention on the Law of the Sea.We should note the tremendous achievements of theUnited Nations in the progressive development ofinternational law. A significant number of instrumentshave been concluded that provide the legal underpinningsof the multilateral system. It is a dynamic process whichis helping to bring more order to international relations.The creation of an international criminal court is amongthe latest initiatives on which substantive work has beendone. Jamaican experts have participated actively in theprogressive development of international law. We areready to contribute further to the machinery of theinternational legal system.To respond to a multitude of challenges  the UnitedNations needs to be renewed and revitalized. There is astrongly shared perception that we must proceedexpeditiously with the task of bringing about the much-needed reform of the United Nations system in thecollective interest. The initiative to restructure and18improve performance  productivity and the cost-effectiveness of the United Nations system is an importantone. The adoption of resolution 50/227 — which containsfurther measures for the restructuring and revitalization ofthe United Nations system in the economic  social andrelated fields — is evidence of the efforts to improve theoperational aspects of the work of the system. Jamaica iscommitted to working with other Member States throughoutthis session of the General Assembly to continue theprocess of strengthening the Organization.The persistence of disputes and conflicts suggests theneed for strengthening the United Nations machinery fordealing with these problems. The Security Council  whichunder the Charter of the United Nations holds the mandatefor the maintenance of international peace and security  hasan important and strategic role to play in the process. Aswe all know  aspects of its composition and role arecurrently under review. Certainly  it is acknowledged thatwe should be moving in the direction of greaterdemocratization and increased participation by MemberStates in critical decisions affecting the internationalcommunity. The expansion of the membership of theUnited Nations and the significant changes in the politicaland economic conditions in Member States must surely beimportant factors in determining changes in the compositionof the Council and the status of its members.Jamaica is not committed to any rigid formula forchange  but whatever formula is arrived at should satisfythe need for democratic participation consistent with thesovereign equality of States and with the equitabledistribution of seats. The need for reform should bematched by increased political will to use the machinery ofthe United Nations for the peaceful settlement of disputesand to cooperate with conciliation efforts under the auspicesof the Secretary-General.Reform must not be for its own sake. The purpose ofreform must be to strengthen the capacity to deliverresponsive and responsible leadership on questions of peaceand security  socio-economic development  human rightsand environmental protection.We understand and support the need for reform of theadministrative and management process in the system  butwhat we cannot accept are unilateral actions to force reformby withholding assessed contributions to the UnitedNations. This has brought the Organization to the brink ofinsolvency and is hampering the very efforts being madefor reform and restructuring. More critical are the seriousconsequences for the development programmes of theUnited Nations.The current crisis will not be resolved until MemberStates pay their arrears and assessed contributionspromptly and without conditions. At the same time  werecognize the need to examine carefully the existingformula for contributions. The establishment of any newformula must be based on the principles of equity and thecapacity of Member States to pay.The agenda of issues before us at this session showsthat there is a great deal to be done. In many areas  wehave made progress  even if it has been slow. It isessential that we continue to make the effort  throughdiscussion  debate and negotiation  to find solutions thatremove from our world the threats of war and conflictand the pain of poverty and misery. Through our jointefforts we can make progress  reach compromises andarrive at solutions that will make our world safer and giveeach and every one of us a greater stake in the future."
"84",3578,"JOR",51,1996,"﻿Permit me at the outset  Sir  to extend warm congratulationsto Mr. Razali on the confidence shown in him by theinternational community in electing him President of theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-first session. I take thisopportunity to extend my best wishes to him and to theother members of the Bureau for success in directing themeetings of this session and in all endeavours to strengthenour Organization and promote peace in our world. I alsocongratulate Mr. Razali’s friendly country  Malaysia.I also take this opportunity to express my thanks andappreciation to his predecessor  Mr. Freitas do Amaral  andthe former members of the Bureau for their effectivestewardship of the fiftieth session.I also wish to express our gratitude to the Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for the dedicatedefforts he has sincerely and honestly made to advance theOrganization and to promote its humanitarian mission ofsettling disputes between States by peaceful means. Inconformity with the decision of the League of Arab States Jordan supports the extension of the Secretary-General’smandate for another term  in order to enable him topursue his mission and efforts in the service ofinternational peace and security and the reforms he hasinitiated in the organs and Secretariat of the Organization.The role of the United Nations and its specializedagencies in the protection of international peace andsecurity and in enhancing and directing the worldeconomy towards liberalization and integration are amongthe main reasons for my country’s devotion to theOrganization and adherence to its Charter. In view of this and out of our sense of responsibility and concern for theefficiency and relevance of the Organization  we appealto all Member States to continue to support it  to fulfiltheir obligations to it consistently and to work to resolveits financial crisis.I assert my country’s firm position on the need toimplement the necessary administrative reforms andrestructure the Security Council. The structure of theCouncil no longer reflects the current balance of power.Any expansion of the permanent membership of theCouncil should take into account the increase in thenumber of developing countries and the growingeconomic power of certain industrial nations  such asGermany and Japan. We have seen many plans andproposals on this matter which the Security Councilshould carefully consider  such as the Italian plan. Areview of the veto power enjoyed by the permanentmembers should reflect the democracy and transparencywe seek.In this context  I must emphasize the need to reviewthe question of economic sanctions  which neitherdistinguish between a political entity and its innocentunarmed civilian population  nor provide compensation tothird States adversely affected by such sanctions. Wemust work together to create a durable formula. We alsocall for opening the membership of the United Nations toall peace-loving States  as stipulated in Article 4.1 of theCharter.This international Organization has made worthypeacekeeping efforts in many countries. It has madehuman sacrifices that would be unfair and unwise toignore. Jordan is very proud to have been among the firstcountries participating in the peacekeeping forces in theformer Yugoslavia and elsewhere. In this regard  mycountry’s effective participation in the ImplementationForce’s peacekeeping and peacemaking operation inBosnia is noteworthy.8In this regard  the fraternal people of Bosnia must becongratulated on the Dayton Agreement and on theelections it has held. A special tribute should be paid toPresident Alija Izetbegovic´ for winning the presidentialelection. We are ready  along with other peace-lovingcountries  to help the people of Bosnia make the newdemocratic experiment a success  consolidate and rebuildthe federal State and promote its reconstruction development  sovereignty and stability.Before I move on to another international issue  Iwould like to congratulate the United Nations on openingthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty for signature.My country is proud to have been among the first countriesto sponsor the draft resolution under which this Treaty wasadopted and to have signed it. We hope that steps towardsnuclear disarmament will continue and will encompass theMiddle East region. We hope that negotiations will beginfor the conclusion of a treaty in the very near futurebanning the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction nuclear and otherwise  so that a nuclear-weapon-free zonemay be established in the Middle East.The peoples of our region have suffered the agonies ofdevastating wars over the past five decades  wars whichhave caused the deaths of tens of thousands  destroyedbasic infrastructures and brought the people of our countriesbloodshed  pain  deprivation  poverty and instability. Due tothe allocation of resources to the war machine and theterrible arms race  their economies have gone intorecession.Signs of hope  however  emerged for these people fiveyears ago with the Madrid Peace Conference in October1991 and the subsequent bilateral and multilateralnegotiations between Arabs and Israelis. Palestinian hopeswere revived with the 1993 Oslo agreement. TheDeclaration of Principles on Interim Self-GovernmentArrangements that followed restored happiness and hope tomillions of Palestinians  who saw in that agreement thebeginning of the end of their pain  bloodshed and destroyedeconomy. They were newly optimistic about securing theirright to self-determination within their own State  rebuildingtheir national economy  industry and infrastructure  whichhad been destroyed by wars  and the onset of peaceful traderelations with their neighbours in Jordan  Israel and othercountries of the region. Hope was also rekindled by thepeace treaty concluded between Jordan and Israel inOctober 1994 and the resulting bilateral agreements on theestablishment of diplomatic and economic relations bilateral and regional cooperation  the reconstruction of theregion and the establishment of strong trade and economicrelations between the two countries  to the benefit of theirpeoples and other peoples in the region  opening the wayto comprehensive regional cooperation.Concrete progress was also made on the Syrian-Israeli and Lebanese-Israeli peace tracks. There wereprospects for a Syrian-Israeli agreement based on the“land-for-peace” principle  providing for full Israeliwithdrawal from the Golan in return for a peaceagreement ending the state of war and paving the way forpeaceful relations based on strong foundations ofunderstanding and normal  peaceful coexistence.Current events and negative factors and measures inthe occupied Arab territories — a return to the settlement-building policy; the violation of the sanctity of the holyplaces; the closure of the territories; the denial of workopportunities; the refusal to implement the agreementssigned on the Palestinian-Israeli track; the postponementand impediment of self-government negotiations; theunilateral determination of the status of Jerusalem and ofthe self-government negotiations; the refusal to resumenegotiations  suspended seven months ago  with Syria andLebanon; and the refusal to return to the terms ofreference and framework of the Madrid PeaceConference — have given rise to frustration among thepeoples of the region  who are beginning to lose therekindled hope to which I have referred.Despite the excessively negative slogans againstpeace used by the new Israeli Government during theelectoral campaign  we in Jordan — the King  theleadership and the people — welcomed the newAdministration and the newly-elected Prime Minister outof respect for the free will of the Israeli people and non-interference in their internal affairs. We called for thecontinuation of the comprehensive peace process in theregion and pledged to utilize the peace treaty with Israelto establish such a comprehensive peace. We urged ourneighbours  Syria and Lebanon  to deal with the newrealities and the new Israeli Government positively andrealistically. Our motto and position at the Arab SummitConference held at Cairo last June was a call to extendmore time and opportunity to the new Israeli Governmentto return to the peace process on the bases agreed upon atthe Madrid Peace Conference: the “land-for-peace”formula and the implementation of Security Councilresolutions 242 (1967)  338 (1973) and 425 (1978).All the participants in the Madrid Peace Conferencehad believed that the success achieved on the Palestinian-Israeli track and the Jordanian-Israeli track had opened to9the peoples of the region  including the Israeli people  thedoor to a new life and a better future based on theprinciples of justice  peace for all  peaceful relations andtrade. They had also believed that this success proved onceagain how misguided and wrong are obsolete principlessuch as that of achieving security through force and thusthrough the imposition of forced solutions. It also debunkedthe principle of occupying other people’s land by force toensure one’s own security. Indeed  it has become clear thatsecurity can be ensured only through dialogue  peacefulcoexistence  negotiations  mutual respect among peoplesand free economic and trade relations  rather than throughpower politics and the imposition of forced solutions. Yetonce again we are hearing certain nervous calls to revivethe obsolete theory of security and the imposition ofsolutions by force.Amid the gloom that has begun to enshroud the peaceprocess  there is still a ray of hope. It is up to us  bothArabs and Israelis  to keep it shining with a view tosecuring a better future for our children and ourgrandchildren. For if  God forbid  we allowed this hope tobecome lost  a renewed cycle of violence  instability tension  terrorism and extremism would prevail in theregion  as shown by the recent bloody violence.At the Cairo summit  all Arab Governments expressedfor the first time their collective support and blessings forthe peace process and proclaimed that peace is anirreversible strategic option. We have heard similar pledgesfrom the new Israeli Government. It is our sincere hope thatthe United States and Russian co-sponsors of the peaceprocess will intervene  and that international efforts will bemade to put the peace process back on track  restore itsprevious vigour and impetus and put an end to all theobstacles that might impede or disrupt it.The war and destruction in the region and the peaceprocess that followed it have been described as a series ofmissed opportunities; for in the past all of us have missedinvaluable opportunities for peace. Now here we are again about to return to that insane policy. By challenging theopponents of peace  President Arafat and the Palestinianleadership have demonstrated a serious and unambiguousdesire to achieve a just  comprehensive and lasting peace.It is not wise to reward him by embarrassing him beforethe Palestinian people and placing him in an unenviablesituation vis-à-vis the opponents of peace  who are bettingon the failure of his policies and the failure of the peaceprocess.Nor is it prudent to stipulate that Syria and Lebanonmust return to the negotiating table without preconditions as though the Madrid Conference and the painstaking andtough negotiations that followed had never taken place.Does this condition itself not constitute a precondition forthe peace process? We all declared our intention tonurture the magnificent baby born at the MadridConference  whom we named “the peace process”. Butthen  we disagreed on the method to be followed in thebaby’s upbringing. Let us return to working together  soas not to kill the baby in its cradle and along with it ourpeoples’ chances for the better life which shone on thehorizon after decades of death and destruction.One of the most important factors for the credibilityof the Middle East peace process is the improvement inthe living conditions of the population through increasedinvestment which has resulted in lowering the highunemployment rate. We in Jordan have taken numerousmeasures  enacted legislation and concluded agreementswith a view to protecting and promoting investment. Iregret that despite these reassuring measures andguarantees and the convening of two internationaleconomic summit conferences — in Casablanca in 1994and in Amman in 1995 — the real outcome in terms ofinvestment in the region has been disappointing. Apartfrom the increase in tourism that we noticed following thesigning of the peace treaty  foreign industrial investmentremains very low notwithstanding the many profitableprojects put forward at the recent Amman economicconference.While private foreign companies may have anexcuse for reluctance to invest  because of fears related tothe regime’s history and political situation  theGovernments of developed industrial countries have noexcuse for their failure to provide their insurancecompanies with sufficient guarantees against investmentrisks to encourage companies to increase theirinvestments. This is particularly true since the increasedprofitability of these companies’ investment projects andthe resulting higher incomes in the recipient developingcountries would benefit the economies of the developedindustrial countries as well. In this regard  we have highhopes for the successful conclusion of the fourtheconomic summit  to be held in Cairo next November.This will provide another opportunity for foreign investorsto contribute to the region’s development and to theconsolidation of peace — quite apart from the benefitsthey and the economies of countries are bound to reap.10One of the region’s biggest and most complexproblems is that of Palestinian refugees; its settlement hasbeen deferred to the final status negotiations. It isregrettable that the international community has not yetgiven this important political and humanitarian problem theattention  understanding and assistance it deserves. Everyyear we receive the report of the Commissioner-General ofthe United Nations Relief and Works Agency for PalestineRefugees in the Near East  in which he describes theAgency’s budget deficit and the consequent need to reducethe level of services provided to the refugees.We urge the wealthy industrial States to give thismatter their fullest attention and to increase theircontribution in order to ensure the survival of thistemporary solution to the major humanitarian problems thataffect over 3.5 million Palestinian refugees  including some1.5 million who live in Jordan. The Government of Jordan despite its limited resources  is compelled to provideassistance and relief worth approximately $300 millionannually. It is necessary to provide support for theAgency’s budget to enable it to continue its workeffectively  pending a final solution of the refugee problemon the basis of United Nations resolutions providing fortheir repatriation or compensation. As long as it remainswithout a substantive and effective solution  this problemwill continue to constitute a time bomb — forgive me forusing this term to indicate the magnitude of this problem —for the peace process  in view of its significanthumanitarian and political dimensions.The subject of peace in the Middle East leads us todemand speedy implementation of the recent agreementbetween Iraq and the United Nations for a partial lifting ofthe embargo on the sale of Iraqi oil in order to providefood and medicine to the brotherly people of Iraq  whohave suffered  and continue to suffer  from the economicsanctions imposed on Iraq. These sanctions have punishedthem but have not affected their leaders. We call upon theGovernment of Iraq to implement United Nationsresolutions; respect the sovereignty  independence andfreedom of neighbouring States; cooperate with the UnitedNations Special Commission; cooperate in the release ofKuwaiti prisoners of war held in Iraq; respect human rights;and establish a democratic system in which the rights of allits communities are respected. At the same time  we call forthe lifting of the economic sanctions that are punishing thepeople of Iraq. We also call for respect for Iraq’ssovereignty and territorial integrity and non-interference inits internal affairs. We reject any attempts aimed at dividingIraq  such as the recently proposed “safe areas” scheme.It is also our hope that the United Arab Emirateswill be able to arrive at a peaceful solution enabling it toregain its three Gulf islands occupied by Iran. We call fornon-interference in the internal affairs of Bahrain andextend our support to that sister country  at a time whenit is the target of terrorism. We call upon Eritrea to finda peaceful solution to the question of its withdrawal fromthe Yemeni Huneish islands in response to Yemen’speaceful efforts  in order to maintain good-neighbourlyrelations and in gratitude for Yemen’s assistance toEritrea in attaining its independence and sovereignty.We call for a just and speedy solution to theLockerbie problem  and for a positive response to theinitiatives and efforts of the League of Arab States  theOrganization of African Unity  the Non-AlignedMovement and the Organization of the IslamicConference  which would ensure the trial and punishmentof the perpetrators of that heinous terrorist act withoutpunishing all the people of Libya.My country supports international efforts to combatinternational terrorism. Hence our active participation atthe Sharm el-Sheikh summit  held earlier this year at theinvitation of our sister country  the Arab Republic ofEgypt  to explore the most effective means ofinternational cooperation in this regard. We also supportthe decisions of the latest summit meeting of the Groupof Seven industrial Powers aimed at fighting terrorismand punishing its perpetrators  as terrorism has become adangerous international phenomenon that has taken thelives of many innocent people  destroyed theinfrastructure of many countries  disrupted tourism andthe free movement of innocent people and defamednational liberation and independence movements. Wetherefore support bilateral  regional and internationalcooperation to combat this ugly and destructivephenomenon.Today the world stands on the threshold of a newcentury  only three years away. That historic occasionmust not pass without our pondering and studying theevents of the twentieth century in preparation for thecoming twenty-first century. We should benefit from thelessons we have learned and the events we havewitnessed in order to make the next century a safer  moresecure  stable and developed one for future generations.An idea worthy of exploration and careful examination inthis regard is that of holding  at the outset of the newcentury  a special session of the General Assembly at theHeads of State level  to prepare for a new world order inwhose shaping all States  large and small  developed anddeveloping  would participate. This is only an idea whichcould be further elaborated and considered.As the representative of a developing country  itconcerns me that despite the great progress achieved in theareas of disarmament and the resolution of global securityproblems  there has been no resolution of the problem ofthe economic security of the developing States. The gapbetween the developed and developing countries in theareas of income and technology is growing. Smalldeveloping countries will not be able to find solutions inthe foreseeable future to their heavy burden of persistentindebtedness. It is both disastrous and painful that manydeveloping countries  such as my country  Jordan  give theirfull efforts to consolidate and develop their democraticsystems  orient their economies towards privatization reform their economic systems  redress their budgetary andbalance-of-payment deficits  fully cooperate with the WorldBank and the International Monetary Fund and makeconcrete strides in this respect  and yet find themselves after their people have devoted all their resources capabilities and productivity to servicing and repaying theirburdensome debts  still striving breathlessly to catch upwith the developed countries  without hope of soon riddingthemselves of this burden. Therefore  the shaping of andpreparation for any new world order to be developed mustconsider the important question of the economic security ofthe developing countries.We now live in a world where distances between itsvarious places and economic markets have been reduceddue to tremendous technological strides in the areas oftransport and communications. This means that thedevelopment and well-being of the developing countries isan important part of the solution to the recession in thedeveloped countries. The idea of holding a special sessionof the General Assembly to prepare for a new worldeconomic order could be the subject of a draft resolutionwhich I hope will be brought before this Assembly forconsideration."
"85",3625,"JPN",51,1996,"﻿I should like  first of all to extend my warmest compliments to His Excellency Mr.Razali Ismail  Permanent Representative of Malaysia to theUnited Nations  on his assumption of the presidency of theGeneral Assembly last week. I also pay tribute to theefforts of His Excellency Mr. Diego Freitas do Amaral who demonstrated great skill in presiding over the historicfiftieth-anniversary session.Last year commemorated the fiftieth anniversary of theUnited Nations. This year marks the fortieth anniversary ofJapan’s admission to the United Nations. Over the past fourdecades  Japan has consistently made its commitment to theUnited Nations one of the main pillars of its foreign policyand has steadfastly supported the United Nations.At the same time  Japan has benefited immensely fromthe international system  including the United Nations. Ishould like to take this opportunity to express my sinceregratitude for the support Japan has received from theinternational community in building the stability andprosperity it enjoys today. In addition  as the role of theUnited Nations grows in importance in the new post-cold-war environment  I hereby affirm that Japan is resolved toplay a more active role by further strengthening thecooperation it extends to the Organization for the sake ofworld peace and prosperity.My ultimate foreign policy goal is the creation of abetter world for future generations  a world free of povertyand conflict. I intend to achieve this goal through changeand creation  which is the mission of my Cabinet. Childrenwho can talk vividly about their dreams of the future arethe world’s treasure. Is it not our grave responsibility  asleaders of the international community  to build anenvironment in which the children of the next generationcan flourish?Efforts towards the creation of a better world forfuture generations must be based on the following threepillars: first  securing world peace and stability; secondly promoting development so as to bring growth and stabilityto developing countries; and thirdly  ensuring the well-beingof each and every citizen throughout global society. Thesethree pillars are interrelated  and we will be unable toachieve a world free of poverty and conflict if any one ofthe three is missing  or if only one of them is in place.Since taking office  I have pursued foreign policiesbased on the strong belief that Japan should be a nationthat works for world peace and stability on its owninitiative. In accordance with this position  Japan intendsto play a leading role in the building of each of thesethree pillars  as I shall subsequently explain. These areprecisely the areas which the United Nations of thetwenty-first century will be expected to address.The first pillar is securing world peace and stability.This is surely of the utmost importance  because unlessthis is achieved  future generations will be left withnothing but confusion and destruction. At this time ofever greater interdependence  world peace is indivisible.Instability in one region can readily lead to the instabilityof other regions and  in turn  to the instability of theworld as a whole. It is Japan’s intention not simply tosecure its own peace and stability but  consonant with thephilosophy embodied in the Constitution of Japan  it willstrive to secure global peace and stability and makegreater efforts  commensurate with its political andeconomic status  for the prevention and resolution ofconflicts in various regions of the world.It goes without saying that  as a nation in Asia Japan will spare no effort in securing peace and stabilityin the region. The recent incident of infiltration by aNorth Korean submarine makes us all the more aware ofthe importance of easing tensions on the Koreanpeninsula. Realization of the four-party meeting  whichwas proposed by the leaders of the United States and theRepublic of Korea last April  is very important  and Ishould like on this occasion to reiterate Japan’s supportfor that proposal. In an effort to further strengthen theachievements of the Cambodian peace process  which hasproved to be a successful example of the internationalcommunity’s peace-building efforts  and looking ahead tothe elections that Cambodia will hold on its own for thefirst time beginning next year  Japan intends to continueto extend assistance to that country. Japan welcomes thefact that Russia  also located in the Asian region  iscontinuing its reform process in the light of the results ofthe recent presidential election. Moreover  by activelyparticipating in political and security dialogue  forexample in the context of the ASEAN Regional Forum Japan is endeavouring to further promote confidence-building in the region.8At the same time  Japan is actively engaged inaddressing issues in other regions  for example bycooperating with United Nations activities to foster globalpeace. During the latter part of August I visited fivecountries in Latin America where I witnessed at first handthe success of the democratization process and steadyprogress in economic reform. Japan intends to strengthen itsassistance for the stable development of this region.In the former Yugoslavia  Japan has contributed bothpersonnel and financing to the local and national electionsrecently held in Bosnia in view of their importance in theformation of a democratic political system. As a member ofthe Steering Board of the Peace Implementation Council Japan will continue to participate actively in the civilianaspects of international efforts towards the implementationof the peace process.On the occasion of Foreign Minister Ikeda’s visit tothe Middle East in August  and Chairman Arafat’s visit toTokyo in mid-September  Japan called for continuednegotiations among the parties to the Middle East peaceprocess. Japan is determined to continue to contribute to thecreation of an environment conducive to the advancementof the peace process by extending assistance to the partiesconcerned  including assistance to the Palestinian people and by participating in multilateral talks.Japan is gravely concerned about the current situationin Iraq. It strongly hopes that Iraq will listen to the opinionof the international community and comply in good faithwith the relevant Security Council resolutions so that thesituation will be settled as soon as possible.In order to resolve the Afghanistan issue it isimportant that foreign interference cease and that thesuccess of the peace and reconciliation efforts of the UnitedNations is ensured. Toward that end  Japan is providing anexpert on that region to serve as a political counsellor at theUnited Nations Special Mission to Afghanistan.The ongoing regional conflicts in Africa  including thesituations in Burundi  Liberia and Angola  are of graveconcern. The international community must actively supportthe conflict-prevention and conflict-resolution efforts ofAfrican countries as well as the strengthening of theircapabilities in this regard. In addition to extending financialcontributions to the Organization of African Unity and theStanding Advisory Committee on Security Questions inCentral Africa  Japan is extending assistance topeacekeeping operations  refugee assistance  rehabilitationassistance  and assistance for democratization in the formof personnel and intellectual input.Peacekeeping operations are an effective complementto the collective security function as originally envisagedin the United Nations Charter  and they supplement theconflict-resolution efforts of the parties themselves. It isimportant that the international community shouldcontinue to support peacekeeping operations but also thatit should seek their further reform. Experiences in recentyears have reaffirmed the effectiveness of traditionalpeacekeeping operations. Their role in preventingconflicts  as exemplified by the success of the UnitedNations Preventive Deployment Force (UNPREDEP)  islikely to become increasingly important. Japan willcontinue to participate in the discussions that are nowunder way among interested Member States on measuresto improve the rapid reaction capabilities of thepeacekeeping operations. Japan is participating in theUnited Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF)in the Golan Heights and intends hereafter to cooperateactively and as much as possible in peacekeepingoperations.I believe that  as it responds to regional conflicts  theUnited Nations has the potential to fulfil  in a practicalmanner  an extremely effective function throughpreventive diplomacy. I should like to propose that ameeting of eminent persons be convened to exploremeans of enhancing the Organization’s preventivediplomacy capability.In order to maintain international peace and stability it is essential to further promote disarmament efforts andto strengthen the regime for the non-proliferation ofweapons of mass destruction. In particular  Japan wouldvigorously emphasize the importance for the internationalcommunity of promoting realistic and steady efforts fornuclear disarmament with the aim of realizing a worldfree of nuclear weapons. As the only country to havesuffered nuclear devastation  Japan has been makingprecisely this appeal to the international community as atop priority in accordance with its own philosophy.Thus I am deeply gratified by the adoption of theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty by the GeneralAssembly with the support of many Member States; thisindeed marks a historic step towards a world free ofnuclear weapons. Having the opportunity just thismorning to sign the Treaty gave me great personalsatisfaction. In order to realize the early entry into forceof the Treaty  Japan would like to call upon those9countries which have expressed opposition to the Treaty toaccede to it at the earliest possible date from the broaderperspective of promoting nuclear disarmament. For its part Japan will continue to make contributions in the field ofverification of nuclear testing  by such means as expandingthe technical cooperation on seismic technologies that itextends to concerned developing countries. As a next steptowards the elimination of nuclear weapons  I should liketo call for the early commencement of negotiations on acut-off treaty which would prohibit the production of fissilematerials for nuclear weapons.Japan takes the problems posed by landmines veryseriously. Japan supports international efforts toward a total worldwide ban on anti-personnel landmines. Furthermore in order to reinforce international support for measures todeal with anti-personnel landmines  Japan is preparing tohost a meeting at the senior official level in Tokyo earlynext year.The promotion of development to bring about thegrowth and stability of developing countries is the secondpillar required for the creation of a better world for futuregenerations. Development is a prerequisite for peace; at thesame time  the maintenance of peace is a precondition fordevelopment. As a leading donor  Japan will work tofurther enhance its official development assistance; at thesame time  it is keenly aware of its responsibility to leadthe discussion on issues relating to the proper form andprovision of such assistance.Based on this recognition  Japan has been calling fora new development strategy. The central ideas in thisstrategy are an emphasis on the ownership by developingcountries of the development process and on theestablishment of a new global partnership in whichdeveloped and developing countries  released from theNorth-South confrontational mind-set  cooperate with eachother. Moreover  it is important to address development notsimply with official development assistance  but also byorganically combining various elements including trade investment  economic policy  debt relief  technologytransfer  and the development of social infrastructure. It isalso important to extend assistance that is most appropriateto the circumstances of the particular country while payingadequate attention to the efforts made by developingcountries in the promotion of democratization and theintroduction of market-oriented economies. Furthermore Japan attaches importance to the setting of developmenttargets and the reinvestment in development activities ofsavings resulting from reforms  as well as to promotingcoordination between the United Nations and the BrettonWoods institutions.We have witnessed the development of variousforms of regional cooperation  such as the SouthernAfrican Development Community  MERCOSUR  and theSouth Pacific Forum; such regional cooperation is animportant element for development. Emphasizing thesignificance of South-South cooperation  Japan is utilizingthe Japanese Human Resources Development Fund in theUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP) inorder to support South-South cooperation.In the context of developing countries  Japanattaches particular importance to the development ofAfrica  where poverty and conflict are particularly acute.Japan will actively promote its initiatives on assistance toAfrican countries  which Foreign Minister Ikeda presentedduring the general debate of the Ninth United NationsConference on Trade and Development  convened inSouth Africa this past spring. In order to give newmomentum to African development  Japan is hoping toconvene the second meeting of the Tokyo InternationalConference on African Development in 1998  whichwould follow a preparatory meeting that will take place also in Tokyo  in 1997.The third pillar to which I would like to refer is theguarantee of the well-being of every citizen of the globalcommunity. It is important to embrace the globalcommunity as a whole  and to give heed to theimportance of each and every one of its members. Indeed the peace of mind of individuals contributes to the peaceand stability of the world.Japan intends to address more actively various socialproblems such as the environment  population  AIDS drugs  terrorism  organized crime  refugees and the statusof women  as well as problems relating to food andenergy  which may become more acute in the years tocome. Concerned about environmental issues  Japan willhost the third conference of the parties to the UnitedNations Framework Convention on Climate Change inKyoto in December next year. Japan will make everyeffort toward the adoption at that conference of aneffective and practical document prescribing aninternational framework to prevent global warming afterthe year 2000. I should like to call for the valuablecooperation of every Member State and internationalorganization concerned for the success of that conference.10Recognizing that it is important that each and everyhuman being be cared for  throughout more than 30 yearsof political activity  I have focused my attention on theprotection of the most vulnerable among us and to theelimination of poverty. The Initiative for a Caring Worldwhich I proposed on the occasion of the Lyons summit ofthe Group of Seven is an extension of this endeavour.Under this initiative  Japan intends  first of all  to sharewith developing countries its experiences in the field ofsocial security  including health care  hygiene and socialwelfare services so that they can develop more effectiveservices in these areas  and secondly  to exchangeexperiences and knowledge with other developed countrieswith respect to issues that they commonly confront.As I stated at the outset  I should like to urge worldleaders to join hands and strengthen their effortsparticularly on behalf of the well-being of children. Eversince the Japan Committee for the United NationsChildren’s Fund (UNICEF) was established in 1955  mymother has been dedicating herself to promoting itsactivities. This has had a profound influence on me  and Itoo have been actively engaged in its activities. Japan hasbeen contributing approximately $30 million to UNICEFannually and it intends hereafter to strengthen itscooperation. As part of its initiatives on assistance to Africawhich I mentioned earlier  Japan announced that it wouldprovide assistance for the expansion of education and theeradication of polio on that continent. It also intends toenhance its assistance for the protection of the health ofvery young children in developing countries.The protection and promotion of human rights is thefoundation of world peace and prosperity. Japan isdetermined to support the democratic development ofdeveloping countries and at the same time hopes that theUnited Nations will further enhance its activities in the fieldof human rights.As we approach the twenty-first century  it is essentialthat the United Nations itself play a role that respondsadequately to the growing expectations of the internationalcommunity based on the three pillars to which I have beenreferring. Towards that end  reforms that strengthen thefunctions of the Organization are necessary. There is aconsensus among the United Nations membership regardingthe importance of the new role envisaged for theOrganization as well as the urgent need for comprehensiveUnited Nations reform. However  when it comes toconcrete measures for reform  a convergence of viewsamong Member States is yet to emerge.With the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations we witnessed an increase in the momentum for reform. Itshould be the aim of this fifty-first session of the GeneralAssembly to maintain this momentum so that a generalagreement on the major elements of reform can bereached before the session ends. The entire UnitedNations membership should then make every effort toreach an agreement on concrete measures to realizeUnited Nations reform in the near future. If the UnitedNations simply engages in repetitious debate and provesincapable of reforming itself to adapt to the changingtimes  its very credibility could be severely undermined.It is thus incumbent upon the membership as a whole tobe tenacious in its efforts to achieve reform.Security Council reform  and reforms inadministrative and financial areas and in economic andsocial areas comprise the threefold centrepiece of UnitedNations reform. I should like to point out the importance above all  of carrying out these reforms as a whole in abalanced manner. For example  even though there may bea financial crisis  if we were to carry out reforms in thatarea alone  separately from reforms in the other twoareas  it would not correspond to the original basicconcept of United Nations reform  which was to seek tostrengthen the functions of the Organization as a whole.Permit me to present the views of Japan regardingreforms in these three areas. I should like first of all todiscuss the reform of the Security Council. Inasmuch asthe Security Council bears the primary responsibility forcarrying out the major purpose of the United Nations namely  the achievement and maintenance of world peaceand stability  its importance is obvious. As it hasindicated on previous occasions  Japan  with theendorsement of many other countries  is prepared todischarge its responsibilities as a permanent member ofthe Security Council in accordance with its basicphilosophy of the non-resort to the use of force prohibitedby its Constitution.Until the reform of the Security Council is realized Japan is determined to contribute to the work of theSecurity Council for the sake of international peace andsecurity  and has presented its candidature for non-permanent membership on the Council in this session ofthe General Assembly. Responding to the strong supportand confidence that have already been expressed withrespect to its candidature  Japan will continue to makeevery effort so that it can play an active role on theSecurity Council.As I stated earlier  Japan attaches great importance todevelopment. More than two thirds of United NationsMember States are developing countries. If the UnitedNations is to aim at achieving a world free of poverty andconflicts  it is crucial that discussions on development befurther promoted within the Organization. In this  thefunctions and role of the Economic and Social Councilshould be strengthened and the integration of the variousdevelopment issues with which the United Nations isengaged should be ensured.Japan is the second largest financial contributor to theUnited Nations; its assessment for the regular budget hasincreased to 15.65 per cent for next year  and is likely toincrease further. Japan will not shirk the tremendousresponsibility it bears in financially supporting the UnitedNations. However  with respect to the scale of assessment I wish to reiterate that Japan attaches importance not onlyto the concept of capacity to pay but also to theresponsibility to pay. Japan also welcomes the endeavoursof the Secretariat towards administrative streamlining andrationalizing.Throughout the four decades since it joined the UnitedNations Japan has faithfully upheld the purposes andprinciples enshrined in the United Nations Charter. It hasconsistently attached importance to the United Nations  andit is proud to be among the countries that have made thegreatest contributions to its overall activities. Disarmament initiatives in the area of nuclear non-proliferation  an appealfor a new strategy on development issues  an activeaddressing of global issues  as well as considerablefinancial contributions to the United Nations — these arethe issues to which Japan has attached profound importancein recent years.I wish to conclude my statement in this general debateby reemphasizing Japan’s readiness to participate in theSecurity Council  which is at the centre of United Nationsactivity  as well as to engage more actively and moreconstructively in the aforementioned areas of endeavour inorder to discharge its responsibility with regard to worldpeace and prosperity."
"86",3650,"KAZ",51,1996,"﻿I wish to congratulate thePresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-first sessionon his election to his high office. I would like to expressmy confidence that he will accomplish his importantmission honourably.There is no doubt that the fifty-first session of theGeneral Assembly will go down in the history of mankindas an important milestone on the world community’s roadto global peace and security. One of the most importantdiplomatic documents of our century  the ComprehensiveNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty  has been opened for signing.On that occasion the President of Kazakstan Mr. Nursultan Nazarbaev  made a special statement which has been circulated as an official United Nationsdocument. The people of Kazakstan  having fullyexperienced the destructive power of nuclear weapons resolutely voted to end the testing of these lethalweapons. In 1991 the President of Kazakstan  expressingthe wish of his people  made a decision to shut down theSemipalatinsk nuclear test site. Thus  Kazakstan hadalready taken decisive measures to ban nuclear testingfive years ago.20Kazakstan is consistent in its policy of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. Recently  we completedthe dismantling of the nuclear infrastructure on the territoryof Kazakstan  thereby eliminating the capability that was until recently  the fourth largest in the world.That is why  when giving their due to all the countrieswhich have trod the thorny path of preparing this Treaty  Ibelieve it is necessary to recognize my country’s significantcontribution to this extremely important cause.However  considerable progress in disarmament doesnot  regrettably  guarantee the stability of the present worldorder. We still witness some negative impulses destroyingthe basis of the relationship between the States whichunited more than half a century ago. We have to admit thatwith the disappearance of a bipolar world  our planet hasnot become safer. On the contrary  the potential for globalconflict has increased considerably increased. That is whythe issue of reforming the United Nations  so that ourcommon Organization can adequately respond to conflictingrealities of international relations at this juncture  isbecoming ever so urgent.Reforms are an indispensable element of any system’sdevelopment. They are even more important in the case ofsuch a universal forum as the United Nations. In his speechat the Special Commemorative Meeting of the GeneralAssembly  the President of Kazakstan underscored theimportant need to increase the world community’s effortsto elaborate a conceptual model of a renewed UnitedNations. It involves new objectives  tasks and functions ofthe United Nations of the next century.The United Nations  being a genuinely universalOrganization  requires a special approach. It is important tokeep in mind that the United Nations is our common home.We cannot count on hotels in case of emergency. That iswhy United Nations reforms should be approached fromrational positions. We want the United Nations to keep upwith the times and to tap the potential for self-improvementand elimination of the vestiges of the past. We want theUnited Nations structure to be more effective and flexiblein dealing with the problems threatening peace and security.Supporting the desire of Japan and Germany to becomepermanent members of the Security Council  Kazakstan isin favour of an expansion of the Council’s non-permanentmembership on the basis of an equitable and balancedrepresentation of all regions. All other proposals should alsobe taken into consideration.Criticism of the United Nations can hardly be areason for doubting its ability to function and for shiftingall the blame onto the Secretary-General. I am sure thatwe have not yet fully mobilized the creative potential ofthe United Nations. This applies first of all to the Charter.We should carefully reread it  taking into considerationtoday’s world order  not to drastically revise  it but to findadditional opportunities hidden in this trulycomprehensive document. It is our opinion that despitethe piles of studies on the legal framework of the UnitedNations  the Charter itself contains enormous unexploredpotential for the renewal of the United Nations. Until theUnited Nations mobilizes these dormant capabilities itwill create the impression of a dormant Organizationunable to respond to the challenges of today.We have to take a closer look at those provisions ofthe Charter that deal with cooperation between the UnitedNations and regional organizations  or  speaking thelanguage of the Charter  with regional arrangements andagencies. This kind of interaction would be extremelyeffective for the development of an early warning systemand preventive diplomacy. Besides  active cooperationwith regional organizations would be beneficial whendealing with economic problems.I would like to recall President NursultanNazarbaev’s proposal to include in the agenda of a futuresession of the General Assembly an item entitled “UnitedNations reforms — an adequate response to thechallenges of the twenty-first century”.One does not have to elaborate on the need to ensurestability and security in the Central Asia region.Kazakstan  as a strategically important State in thisregion  makes every effort to guarantee tranquillity inCentral Asia.However  the situation in the region defiesstraightforward assessment. There are zones oftranquillity  including Kazakstan  but there are also zonesof conflict. One matter of great concern is the situation inAfghanistan. Further escalation of the conflict inAfghanistan could have negative effects on the situationin Central Asia. We are grateful to the Security Councilfor paying attention to the situation in that country. Thereis no doubt that the Security Council statement of 28September 1996 is important for the resolution of thesituation there. At the same time  we urge the SecurityCouncil to take up this item again in order to elaboratemeasures to stop the conflict.21The situation in Central Asia underscores the need forgreater interaction between the region and the UnitedNations. Such interaction would cause Central Asia tobecome more involved in international cooperation. CentralAsia could undoubtedly contribute to the establishment ofa safer world order.In this regard  we pin great hopes on the establishmentby the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and thePacific (ESCAP) and the United Nations EconomicCommission for Europe (ECE) of a joint commission forCentral Asia. We appreciate the positive United Nationsreaction to this initiative of our Head of State.Kazakstan wants to join the World Trade Organizationas soon as possible and is taking concrete steps in thisdirection.We are grateful to the United Nations for its supportof Kazakstan’s proposal concerning the resolution on transitenvironment in the landlocked States of Central Asia.We are also pleased at the positive reaction of theUnited Nations to the initiative of the leaders of the threeCentral Asian States concerning the formation of a CentralAsian peacekeeping battalion. I would like to take thisopportunity to state that the Central Asian peacekeepingbattalion will be committed to the United Nations Charterand will serve the ideals and purposes of our Organization.Four years ago  speaking at the United Nations  thePresident of Kazakstan pointed out the necessity ofconvening a conference on interaction and confidence-building measures in Asia. It is with deep satisfaction thatwe can report that our quest for peace and security on theAsian continent is being supported by an ever increasingnumber of States. Experts are at work on a permanentbasis. A conference on Asian security took place at thelevel of Deputy Foreign Ministers. We are especiallygrateful to the United Nations for its assistance in theimplementation of the initiative of our Head of State.Kazakstan regards the convocation of this conference oninteraction and confidence-building measures in Asia as itscontribution to United Nations global peacekeeping efforts.Kazakstan fully supports the peace-making activitiesof the United Nations in different parts of the world. Wehave no doubt that the United Nations should play apriority role in the maintenance of international peace andsecurity. Our common task is to prevent United Nationspeace-making functions from being delegated to any otherorganizations. The diminished peace-making potential ofthe United Nations is not its fault  but its misfortune.Kazakstan believes that United Nations peace-making activities could be rendered more effectivethrough a more precise formulation and strengthening ofthe missions’ mandates. They could thereby make asignificant contribution to the resolution of crisissituations.When we talk about international issues we cannotignore a trend as alarming as the growth of secessionism.This phenomenon has become one of the major causes ofcrisis situations in the world  particularly in the post-Soviet context. We think that the United Nations mustpay close attention to the destructive consequences ofaggressive secessionism. The time has come to put an endto the absolute right of nations to self-determination.Basically  the world has already realized the right to self-determination; further continuation of this process willcreate new trouble spots and lead to more bloodshed. Thecurrent world order should rest on the principles of thesovereignty and territorial integrity of States. If we reallycare about the stability of the current world order wemust firmly reject any manifestation of secessionism. Ourhighest values should be the peace  well-being andhappiness of peoples  and we can achieve these goals notby instigating peoples to self-determination but bycreating appropriate conditions for the sustainableeconomic development of all nations.From this lofty rostrum it is impossible to ignoreanother problem that brings great pain to humankind  apain which our country feels especially acutely. I amreferring to environmental disasters. There may be noother place in the world where such vast territories areaffected by the consequences of these disasters. Indeed more than half of Kazakstan’s territory could be declaredan environmental disaster area. However  it is not only amatter of territories  but people who are still suffering.The Semipalatinsk nuclear test site and the Aral Sea havebecome disaster areas of global dimensions. Furthermore we should not forget that Kazakstan has been the site ofchemical and biological weapons tests.All these problems require priority attention from theUnited Nations. During economic transition  even largeStates cannot cope alone with environmental problems ofsuch magnitude. It is also important to remember that itis innocent people who suffer  not the ones who createdor tested these lethal weapons. They are the victims of thearms race between the two opposing systems  victims of22the totalitarian thinking of the cold war period. They haveevery right to demand the attention of internationalorganizations and donor countries.We cannot say that the United Nations has beenindifferent to the consequences of the environmentaldisasters in Kazakstan. But  at the same time  we cannotclaim that the victims of these environmental disasters havefelt practical results of the activities of internationalmissions. We are grateful to the United NationsDevelopment Programme (UNDP)  the United NationsChildren’s Fund (UNICEF) and the World Bank for theelaboration of large-scale programmes for the rehabilitationof the Aral Sea zone. At the same time  we are lookingforward to a more active execution of these programmes.Meanwhile  the situation in this region  as well as in otherenvironmental disaster areas  remains extremely serious.Kazakstan welcomes and supports the resolution of theUnited Nations General Assembly to convene a specialsession on environment and sustainable development in themiddle of next year. We hope that this forum will adoptmeaningful decisions on environmental problems that alsoaffect our country.This century  which has witnessed two world wars  thecollapse of the colonial system and the disintegration of thesocialist system  has begun a new phase. This phase hasnew dimensions  both geo-political and geo-economic.In politics  a trend towards the globalization ofinternational problems has been apparent. With the end ofthe cold war  the problems of nuclear non-proliferation havenot been solved. The problem of environmental security hasacquired global dimensions. The globalization ofcommunications has triggered illegal trafficking in weapons drugs and money of giant proportions. A new informationrealm has been formed in which national borders havebecome merely symbolic.Previously unknown methods of production haveemerged  increasingly referred to as “computer civilization”.Scientific research and technological factors have grown inimportance as never before. New technologies have becomethe hottest items in world markets. The role of a State inworld economic ties is changing; it is no longer thedominant institute. International institutes function asindependent international economic entities.It is with this list of problems  which is far from beingcomplete  that we are entering the next century. We haveyet to sort them out and find optimal ways to adapt to newrealities which will be facing us in the twenty-firstcentury. We have to admit that humankind  creating theseproblems through its activities  still cannot find adequateways to solve them.That is why we turn to the United Nations. Ourcommon home is becoming a quintessence of the humanmind. We have to help the United Nations reach a newlevel in dealing with global trends. A renewedOrganization  promptly reacting to the challenges oftoday  will not only enrich itself but will also give us asense of confidence on the eve of the next century."
"87",3697,"KEN",51,1996,"﻿On behalf of the Governmentof Kenya  I should like to convey to you  Sir  my sincerecongratulations and best wishes on your unanimous electionas President of this session of the Assembly. Your electionto this high office is a fitting testimony to Malaysia’scommitment to  and support for  the United Nations. Yourcountry has been an ardent champion of the cause ofdeveloping countries. I am confident that your sterlingqualities and versatile diplomatic capabilities will steer thisOrganization to greater heights.I also wish to pay tribute to your predecessor Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral  who presided over the lastsession with great skill and dedication.In the same vein  allow me to reiterate mydelegation’s appreciation to the Secretary-General for theable manner in which he has borne the mantle of thisOrganization. We wish to commend him for hisachievements during the last five years  despite the manyobstacles that the Organization has faced.Since its inception  the General Assembly hasprovided Member States with the opportunity to exchangeviews on issues of common concern to the internationalcommunity  with a view to securing a stable and peacefulworld. To this end  I wish to assure you  Sir  of Kenya’scommitment and determination to work together withother Member States in order to realize the Organization’sideals and objectives. We believe that the success of theUnited Nations depends on the collective resolve of itsMembers.The international community still faces a number ofconflicts that are of great concern  as they continue toundermine international peace and security. We arepainfully reminded by history that good and evil coexist and that without societal restraints  humanity is in eternaldanger. As we approach the twenty-first century  and withthe cold war behind us  the international community nowfaces numerous new and complex challenges posed byglobalization  fragmentation  democratization andmarginalization. There is a need to redesign theinternational order to meet these challenges. In thisregard  we welcome the recent initiatives by theOrganization to strengthen its conflict-preventionmechanisms and to promote preventive diplomacy andconfidence-building measures.The scourge of armed conflicts in certain parts ofAfrica constitutes one of the most urgent socio-politicalproblems facing the continent  resulting in a serious threatto security  social cohesion and economic progress. Theseconflicts have posed serious challenges primarily due tothe complexities associated with their internal character.Inter- and intra-State conflicts have led to a multitude ofproblems  including loss of life  destruction of property poverty  ethnic tensions and underdevelopment in thecountries where they occur.5These conflicts have been compounded by naturalcalamities resulting in a large number of refugees anddisplaced persons. We wish to reiterate our call to theinternational community to increase its support inalleviating the suffering of these people.Since the inception of the Organization of AfricanUnity (OAU) in 1963  we have witnessed no less than 20full-fledged civil wars on the African continent. Over theyears  some of these wars have been resolved  while othershave intensified. We are pleased that peace has beenachieved in most parts of Africa. Sadly  however  there arestill some intractable conflicts going on  notably in Burundi the Sudan  Somalia and Liberia.The conflict in Burundi  with its accompanying ethniccharacter  is of great concern to Kenya and the countries ofthe subregion. The recent coup d’etat in that country  whichoverthrew a constitutionally established Government  hascompounded the political crisis. It negates the efforts of theOAU to bring to an end the era of military coups whichhave bedeviled the continent and remains an obstacle toAfrica’s quest for peace and stability.In their efforts to find a lasting political settlement  thecountries of the subregion — Ethiopia  Rwanda  Tanzania Uganda  Zaire and Kenya — held a series of meetingsculminating in the imposition of sanctions against thatsisterly country. These sanctions are aimed at puttingpressure on the new regime to restore a democraticallyelected Assembly  unban political parties and enter intounconditional negotiations with all parties to the conflict.While we welcome the recent Security Councilresolution on Burundi  we appeal to the Council to takemore decisive steps to ensure that the leaders in Burundicomply with the peace initiative of the second regionalsummit on Burundi held in Arusha. In this regard  mydelegation wishes to take this opportunity to commend theefforts of Julius Nyerere  former President of the UnitedRepublic of Tanzania  who continues to facilitate the peaceprocess in Burundi. We take this opportunity to urge theinternational community to render support to thesemeasures and initiatives.The situation in Somalia continues to be worrisome.The prolonged nature of this conflict  with itsaccompanying negative effects on the neighbouringcountries  remains a matter of great concern to my country.It is now time for the international community to bringpressure to bear on the Somali faction leaders to come tothe negotiating table and reach agreement that will  onceand for all  relieve the agony and suffering of the Somalipeople. Kenya will continue to provide its cooperationand support.With respect to the search for a durable peace in theSudan  Kenya  as the Chairman of the IntergovernmentalAuthority on Drought and Development (IGADD)subcommittee on the peace initiative on Sudan  is workingtogether with the other member States to find appropriateremedies to the conflict. While there are no easy solutionsto this conflict  the countries of the region  which remainseized of the matter  are hopeful that  through preventivediplomacy  there will soon be an end to the atrocities andthat peace will be restored in the Sudan as well.I wish to take this opportunity to express theappreciation of my Government for the confidence theOAU has bestowed upon my country by endorsing Kenyaas the sole candidate for the non-permanent seat in theSecurity Council allocated to Africa for the period1997-1998 at the elections to be held later this year. Theelection of Kenya to the Council will provide us with theopportunity to contribute even further to the continuedsearch for international peace and security.The maintenance of international peace and securityis a collective responsibility of us all. It was with this inmind that the General Assembly at its fiftieth sessionurged the Conference on Disarmament to conclude thenegotiations for a comprehensive and truly verifiabletreaty banning all nuclear testing. It was also with thisunderstanding and expectation that Kenya and otherAfrican countries affirmed their commitment to outlawingnuclear testing and the possession of nuclear weapons onthe African continent. Towards this end  the PelindabaTreaty was signed in Cairo on 11 April 1996  declaringAfrica a Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone. We commendsimilar efforts that have been undertaken to declare otherregions nuclear-free zones.Kenya reaffirms its commitment to total nucleardisarmament. There is no longer any justification for thepossession of nuclear weapons nor for their testing. Wemust work towards the achievement of the goal ofcomplete elimination of all nuclear weapons within agiven time-frame. Kenya therefore welcomes the recentconclusion of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-BanTreaty as an important step in this direction.The United Nations has a critical role to play inconsensus- building in international economic cooperation.Kenya is confident that the Organization will continue to6uphold its principles of universality  sovereignty andmultilateralism in its decisions and operational activities.We are of the view that the United Nations should bestrengthened in order effectively to carry out its mandateand follow-up on the programmes of action that have beenagreed upon at the various international conferences. Thecontinuum of global conferences in recent years hasenabled us to create a new vision of cooperation towardsglobal development needs. Indeed  the most recent of these the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements(Habitat II)  which took place in Istanbul  Turkey  endorsedthe need for quick action in addressing the dual objectivesof adequate shelter for all and sustainable humansettlements. To realize these objectives  the Conferencecalled for new and additional resources and for thestrengthening of the United Nations Centre for HumanSettlements in order for it effectively to carry out itsmandate. In this context  Kenya believes that  for this tobecome a reality  international commitment is imperative.We also view the World Food Summit to be held inRome this year as a major United Nations conference thatwill address itself to the primary needs of mankind byensuring food security and sustainable development. Weexpect the international community to render appropriatesupport in order to realize these objectives.While most developing countries continue in theirstrenuous economic reform efforts  the question of the debtburden and debt servicing remains a major obstacle. Kenyacalls for an early consensus on debt relief  reduction andpossible cancellation. It is expected that the Bretton Woodsinstitutions will quickly conclude their consultations on thesteps to be taken to address the debt problem of developingcountries. These should include additional innovativemeasures that would provide social safety nets to vulnerablegroups  particularly children  women and the poor.My own country  Kenya  under the leadership ofPresident Daniel arap Moi  has undertaken far-reachingpolitical and economic reforms. These reforms have beenundertaken at painful costs and with adverse effects on thepopulation. However  after suffering a decline in economicgrowth as a result of the stringent reform measures  oureconomy is now on the path of recovery and has registereda growth rate of between 5 and 6 per cent this year. TheKenyan economy is now totally liberalized. All foreignexchange restrictions have been abolished  making Kenyaone of the most attractive investment destinations anywherein the world. In order to achieve higher growth and tomaintain the development momentum  Kenya appeals forthe continued commitment  understanding and support ofour development partners.We are also committed to regional integration andthe widening of economic space  designed to integratenational economies into formal groupings  centring ontrading blocs. The inauguration of the East AfricanCooperation in Arusha early this year by the three Headsof State of Kenya  Uganda and Tanzania  marks animportant milestone in our efforts towards political andsocio-economic integration. This arrangement  whichbrings together a population of over 70 million people has created vast opportunities for investment in oursubregion. It also constitutes an important building blocktowards the realization of the African economiccommunity.We have also recently revitalized IGADD andexpanded its mandate to focus on issues of developmentand conflict prevention  management and resolution. Therevitalized IGADD will require full support from ourdevelopment partners for a speedy implementation of theregional initiatives. In the wider subregion  the CommonMarket for Eastern and Southern Africa continues to bethe main vehicle for regional integration in eastern andsouthern Africa.Kenya’s greatest asset is its environment. The herdsof wildlife which migrate through the plains  themysterious forests  the snow-peaked mountains  theancient lakes and the extraordinary landscapes of theGreat Rift Valley have attracted generations of visitorsand have become to many a symbol of the beauty andpurity of the African continent. Throughout the world space is being taken up for development purposes byexpanding populations. Inappropriate land practices runcounter to the conservation of natural resources. Preciousspecies are becoming either endangered or indeed extinct.In Kenya  our policies have been designed topreserve the environment as a common heritage formankind. We have resisted all pressures againstconservation and have created a sanctuary for a greatvariety of biodiversity in all its grandeur. Furthermore  theGovernment of Kenya has recently initiated majorinnovative steps that will ensure the protection of theecosystem for the enjoyment of future generations. Theseinclude public awareness  environmental education  and most importantly  the Great Rift Valley ConservancyProgramme  which will ensure integrated utilization ofland. We wish to appeal to the international communityto make available the necessary resources to augment7such efforts  in order to realize the objective of sustainabledevelopment as called for in Agenda 21.In the face of the complex nature of emergingproblems in the world today  the demands on the UnitedNations continue to increase as Member States expect moreand more from it. The pressures of facilitating conflictresolution and peacekeeping  promoting sustainabledevelopment and combating social problems associated withpoverty  disease and famine  have made the demands evenmore urgent.We therefore welcome efforts to reform the UnitedNations so that it can serve the interests of Member Statesmore effectively. However  as the United Nations continuesin its reform endeavours  the General Assembly must begiven greater visibility and authority. The Security Councilmust be reformed to reflect the principles of democracy transparency and equitable representation. My delegationwishes to urge Member States to exercise greater flexibilityon the various innovative positions with regard to reform ofthe Security Council in order to reach an early consensus.Similarly  in undertaking financial reforms  bold andpractical measures are necessary to ensure adequate andpredictable resources. The obligation of Member States topay their assessed contributions for the regular andpeacekeeping budgets  in full  on time and withoutconditions  cannot be overemphasized.We wish to underscore that reform cannot be an endin itself but must be seen as a necessary tool for enablingthe Organization to achieve its objectives in a moreefficient and cost-effective manner.We welcome the recent arrangements to establishNairobi as the location of one of the four United NationsCentres — the only one in the whole of the developingworld. We regret  however  that the two United Nationsprogrammes with their Headquarters in Nairobi continue tosuffer from lack of adequate funding and capacityunderutilization  despite their enormous potential.The recent tendency to locate environment-relatedsecretariats away from Nairobi has had a negative effect onthe strengthening of the Centre and should be discouraged.We are convinced that institutional linkage is a vitalcomponent for the enhancement of efficiency and capacity-utilization of the limited resources. In this respect  Kenyawishes to record its appreciation to the Secretary-Generalfor holding the meeting of the Administrative Committee onCoordination in Nairobi in April 1996 — a first for thedeveloping world. We in Africa were particularly proud tohost that high-level meeting  which took placeimmediately after the Secretary-General launched theUnited Nations System-wide Special Initiative on Africa.Finally  we wish to take this opportunity tocommend the Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for initiating far-reaching reforms within theUnited Nations system since his assumption of the highoffice of chief executive of the Organization. Mydelegation wishes to express its satisfaction at his untiringefforts to steer the Organization to greater heights as wemove into the next century."
"88",3721,"KGZ",51,1996,"﻿Guided by feelings of great respect for Malaysia which plays an increasingly significant role in regional andworld affairs  I welcome the election to the presidency ofthis session of the General Assembly the experienced andwell-known representative of that country  Mr. RazaliIsmail.We  the newly independent States of the former SovietUnion  are celebrating this year the fifth anniversary of ourindependence and national statehood. My country issuccessfully concluding a stage in its structural reforms andhas achieved macroeconomic stabilization. We havemanaged to halt the decline in production and this year weexpect an increase in production of 3 to 4 per cent. Theannual rate of inflation is not expected to exceed 26 percent. We are finalizing the legal basis for a marketeconomy and for building new institutions. The goal nowis to join the World Trade Organization.Regional cooperation is gaining in strength. In thecontext of the Central Asian Union  the EconomicCooperation Organization and the Commonwealth ofIndependent States  we are creating conditions conduciveto the free movement of goods  capital  services andlabour. Entirely new areas are now linked bytransportation lines  and the groundwork is being laid forlong-term  comprehensive efforts to ensure the sustainabledevelopment of the Central Asian region.We  the newly independent States  are rapidlybecoming involved in the globalization process of theworld economy; we are deriving clear benefits from thisas well as significant damage and losses. Alongside theliberalization of trade and the opening of State borders our fragile economies are being affected by transnationalorganized crime  including drug trafficking. Drug dealersare corrupting State institutions and are eroding the basisof our young statehood.Drug trafficking and arms trade are flourishing inconflict areas. It is evident that powerful internationalcriminal forces  which are reaping profits from this  areinterested in the continuation and exacerbation of conflictsin Tajikistan and Afghanistan. Drugs have a destructiveeffect on weak and powerful countries alike. Localcapacities and international assistance from donorcountries to fight drug trafficking pale in comparison tothe scale and geo-economic destructive effect of the drugtrade.Five Central Asian countries were the second group following Eastern European nations  to sign amemorandum of understanding with the United NationsInternational Drug Control Programme. We continue tofight this evil through regional cooperation. A subregionalprogramme for Central Asia provides an opportunity todevelop projects that provide legitimate alternatives topeople engaged in the cultivation and transport of illegalcrops. My country welcomes consideration of this issueat a special session of the General Assembly to be held in1998  and is convinced that the world community willtriple its support to programmes to stop the flow of drugsto the countries of the North.Sustainable development formed the basis of thenational human development strategy prepared on theinitiative of the President of the Republic of Kyrgyzstan Mr. Askar Akayev. During the past decade  from Viennato Istanbul  the international community  under the aegisof the United Nations  has defined goals  tasks andpriorities for world social development. Kyrgyzstan10intends creatively and fully to implement the decisionstaken. We look forward with great interest to thediscussions on Agenda 21 that are due to take place at thespecial session of the General Assembly to be convened in1997.Countries with economies in transition are goingthrough a difficult period of economic rehabilitation. Theproblems of attracting direct foreign investment areparticularly acute. We are inspired by the experience of thecountries of Central and Eastern Europe that havesuccessfully managed the transition to a market economy.Many of them have joined the Organization for EconomicCooperation and Development  and established nationalexport and import banks and State insurance facilities forprivate enterprises abroad. Today it is becomingincreasingly clear that timely and adequate assistance andcredits from the international community  combined withenormous efforts by the countries themselves  are enablingcountries in transition to emerge rapidly from their crisesand thus join the group of development donors. The effectof such a multi-layered approach to resolving commondevelopment problems is clear  and there is no doubt thatseveral post-Soviet independent countries could shortly bein the vanguard of this progress.For a long time much has been said about the need forcooperation between the United Nations and the BrettonWoods institutions in strengthening peace and resolvingeconomic development problems. In recent years a hugenumber of regional alliances have come into being inresponse to contemporary challenges  and they are activelycooperating with one another. Today  it would be difficultto overestimate the importance of their role in resolvinginter-ethnic disputes and conflicts and developing trade transport  communications and sociocultural relationships inthese regions. The United Nations could systematize andsummarize the successful work of these unions andalliances  which are like blood vessels in the way they linkthe United Nations system with the World Bank  regionalbanks and the International Monetary Fund  offering aneffective regional approach to dealing with the entire rangeof complex issues on today’s world agenda.Geo-economic regions such as the Fergana valley arefacing a great number of acute problems  includingunemployment  environmental deterioration  poverty inequality of women and all types of crime. They can  andshould  be a focal point for the attention and effort of allcountries concerned in Central Asia  for the United Nationssystem  and for donor countries. Consistent and vigorousefforts to resolve the urgent development problems of thisdensely populated valley will also act as necessarypreventive actions to strengthen security  stability andpeace between the States of the region.My country wholly supports the efforts of the UnitedNations  the Organization for Security and Cooperation inEurope and the Commonwealth of Independent States  tobring about a peaceful settlement in the inter-Tajikconflict. We commend the contributions made by Russiaand Iran  and welcome the mediating role ofTurkmenistan  which has opened a goodwill office forconducting the inter-Tajik talks.Every conflict has a recognizable identity. It is timefor the United Nations to synthesize and develop the legalbasis  procedures  and methods of work for each partyinvolved  whether they are representatives of internationalorganizations  the parties to the conflict or variousworking groups. The United Nations should have regularconsultations with the countries in the region and with theregional alliances.Because of the protracted nature of the crisis  whichhas caused enormous suffering to innocent civilians  andgiven the widespread consequences of the hostilities forneighbouring countries  we believe that a solution to theinter-Tajik conflict should be the basis for the long-termsustainable development of that country and for the wholeof Central Asia.The exodus of refugees from Tajikistan iscontinuing. This is a painful subject for the people ofTajikistan  and we feel for them in their suffering. Theratification by Kyrgyzstan this year of the 1951Convention relating to the Status of Refugees of and its1967 Protocol was not merely a demonstration of ourrespect for human rights but reflected our willingness toshare the international community’s burden ofresponsibility for providing assistance to people who areforced to leave their homes to seek protection forthemselves and their children. The conference on theproblem of refugees and displaced persons in theCommonwealth of Independent States  which wasorganized by the Office of the United Nations HighCommissioner for Refugees in Geneva in May 1996 demonstrated the international community’s full supportfor refugees from Tajikistan.The humanitarian situation remains critical particularly in mountainous areas  which are very hard toreach  and especially now  with winter approaching. Weare convinced that not only the United Nations and itsspecialized agencies but the World Bank  the InternationalMonetary Fund  the European Union and the Organizationfor Economic Cooperation and Development will worktogether successfully to promote a peaceful settlement ofthe conflict and alleviate the hardship and pain of the long-suffering Tajik people.With regard to recent events in Afghanistan  webelieve that a comprehensive political settlement must befound to the Afghan conflict  that territorial integrity cannotbe ensured and that non-interference in the internal affairsof this sovereign country must be respected. We call on theSecurity Council to work for national reconciliation amongthe warring factions and to seek an end to the long debilitating war that has destabilized the Asian continent asa whole.Half a century of experience of world politicaldevelopment under the aegis of the United Nations leads usto conclude that there should be more non-conflict sustainably developing nuclear-weapon-free zones. Thiswould guarantee peace and security. The long-awaited hourhas come: the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty hasbeen signed by an overwhelming majority of StatesMembers of the United Nations. When I signed the Treatyon behalf of my people  as the representative of a countrythat until recently had been squeezed from both sides bytwo of the world’s largest nuclear-weapon-testing areas  Iexperienced a special feeling of satisfaction and hope forthe future of my country and for the whole world.The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of NuclearWeapons and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treatyare major milestones on the road to a future nuclear-weapon-free world. We are resolved to make Central Asiaa nuclear-weapon-free zone. Support and appropriateguarantees from the nuclear States would constitute animportant prerequisite for that achievement.The Kyrgyz Republic is in favour of reforming theUnited Nations. The permanent membership of the SecurityCouncil should be enlarged to include Germany  Japan andrepresentatives of Africa  Asia and Latin America.Equitable geographical representation would also mean anincrease the number of non-permanent members of theCouncil. The nature of the interaction between the SecurityCouncil and the General Assembly should also change  andbecome more transparent.Since becoming Members of the United Nations lessthan five years ago  the newly independent States havebecome full-fledged members of the United Nations family.We  like others  were pleased about the establishment ofpeace in Haiti and Bosnia  and paid tribute to the manypeople who lost their lives  in whatever part of the world.With regard to regional alliances  we are developing ourrelations equally with West and East  South and North.Three countries of our group — Kyrgyzstan  Kazakstanand Uzbekistan — are creating a Central Asianpeacekeeping battalion to act as a future reserve force ofBlue Helmets. On a basis of mutual respect  Russia Kazakstan  Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan this year concludeda treaty on confidence-building measures in the militarysphere on the border with the People’s Republic of China.We are determined to learn every step of the way. We together with the other Member States  are on the road tothe twenty-first century. By combining our efforts weshall be worthy to meet its new challenges."
"89",3766,"KHM",51,1996,"﻿Allow me  at the outset  to warmly congratulateHis Excellency Mr. Razali Ismail  on behalf of theCambodian delegation  on his election to the post ofPresident of this Assembly. His election is a tribute to hisprofessionalism  as well as to his country  Malaysia  withwhich Cambodia has traditionally entertained close andcordial relations. My delegation is convinced that with hiscompetence and experience  Ambassador Ismail will guideour session with wisdom and perspicacity to a successfulconclusion.My delegation would also like to congratulate andthank His Excellency Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral ofPortugal for his successful presidency of the GeneralAssembly’s fiftieth session.I wish also to take this opportunity to express our deepappreciation to an individual to whom the Royal Kingdomof Cambodia owes profound gratitude for the role he hasplayed in the peace process in our country — the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali — for his performance and sincere dedication inaccomplishing this lofty mission.(spoke in English)The forthcoming 23 October will be the fifthanniversary of the signing of the Agreement on aComprehensive Political Settlement of the CambodiaConflict. The Royal Government and people of Cambodiawill mark this historic event with a nationwide celebration.The Agreement was forged“to maintain  preserve and defend the sovereignty independence  territorial integrity and inviolability neutrality and national unity of Cambodia” (Agreementon a Comprehensive Political Settlement of theCambodia Conflict  DPI/1180-92077  p. 8  para. 3)through the restoration of peace and the promotion ofnational reconciliation in the country. The Cambodianpeople will always remember the sacrifices made by theinternational community on their behalf  especially thoseeminent persons who dedicated themselves to the cause ofpeace and democracy in our country. We are indeedindebted to them all and remain deeply grateful for theircontinued contribution to the reconstruction anddevelopment of Cambodia  allowing it once more to takeits proper place in the concert of nations.The Royal Government of Cambodia  presided overby His Royal Highness Samdech Krom Preah NorodomRanariddh and His Excellency Samdech Hun Sen  wasborn of a free and fair election organized and supervisedby the United Nations in May 1993. It is now barely threeyears old  but thanks to the determination of theCambodian people and the invaluable assistance andsupport given by this world body and its agencies  otherinternational organizations and friendly countries  therebuilding of Cambodia has proceeded apace.In “An Agenda for Peace”  His Excellency theSecretary-General Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali spoke of theneed for the United Nations to give careful considerationto the requirements of post-conflict peace-building. Ascan be seen from the Cambodian experience  this is acomplex and multifaceted process. The Secretary-General’s Representative in Cambodia The HonourableBenny Widyono commented in a recent article that“post-conflict peace-building is not just a collectionof disjointed activities. It requires a holistic conceptencompassing political  institutional  legal  economicand social objectives.”This holistic approach has also been very rapidlyrecognized by the Royal Government. Nine months afterthe general elections  it launched the National Programmefor the Rehabilitation and the Development of Cambodia in February 1994. At the same time  it was able to ensurepolitical stability  improve security and engineer a rapideconomic recovery  as reflected by a strong grossdomestic product growth of 7.6 per cent  an inflation ratekept at 3.5 per cent and a stable exchange rate of thenational currency throughout 1995. These figures combined with a liberal investment law and a low grossdomestic product of $287 per capita  are providing strongincentives for foreign direct investment  in particular now13that Cambodia enjoys most-favoured-nation status with theUnited States  the European Union and other importantcountries in the world. Soon Cambodia hopes to obtainGeneralized System of Preferences status.In pursuing its aims of structural reforms anddevelopment while seeking to improve the quality of life ofits citizens  the Royal Government is conscious of the needfor environmental protection. Cambodia has become asignatory of the United Nations Convention on BiologicalDiversity and the Convention to Combat Desertification inThose Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/orDesertification. The Government is ever mindful of itsresponsibility to protect Cambodia’s rich natural heritage in the interests both of its people and of the world at large.Therefore  as stated by the First Prime Minister at the FirstConsultative Group Meeting  held last July in Tokyo  theRoyal Government is committed to implementing asustainable and transparent forest policy in line with therecommendations put forward in a joint study made by theWorld Bank  the United Nations Development Programme(UNDP) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of theUnited Nations (FAO).Being profoundly conscious that development requiressecurity  problems linked with the Khmer Rouge have to beaddressed through their reintegration into the national fold and through the long-term policy of development of ruralareas. Military operations near the northwestern border aredesigned to gradually reduce the nuisance they pose and toconvince them to join the national community. Nationalunity remains the target of the Cambodian Government.The recent massive breakaway of the core groups of theKhmer Rouge testifies to the correctness of the RoyalGovernment’s approach.Recognizing that Cambodia’s tragic recent historyrequires special measures to assure the protection of humanrights and the non-return to the policies and practices of thepast  the Royal Government has pursued an active policy toensure respect for human rights and fundamental freedomsfor all in Cambodia without discrimination as to race  sexor religion. In these efforts  it has received the technicalassistance of the United Nations Centre for Human Rights for which the Royal Government is greatly appreciative. Inparticular  Cambodia acknowledges the valued contributionof the Special Representative of the Secretary-General forHuman Rights  Ambassador Thomas Hammarberg.Mindful that human rights encompass political rights the Kingdom of Cambodia adopted a policy of liberaldemocracy and pluralism  as stated in article 51 of theConstitution of the Kingdom  in 1993. This includes thefree exercise of political choice. In respect of its solemncommitment to the Constitution  the Royal Governmentis making preparations for the holding of local electionsin 1997 and national elections in 1998. To this end  itwelcomes international technical and financial assistance as well as international observers.The achievements of the Royal Government in ashort period of time have given it the confidence topursue efforts towards the declared aims of building aState governed by the rule of law  a market system thatsecures social benefits and ensuring the long term andsustainable development of the national economy withinthe framework of regional integration. Hence  last April Cambodia submitted its official request for fullmembership in the Association of South-East AsianNations (ASEAN) by July 1997  in the recognition thatASEAN is the vehicle for peace  security  stability  sharedopportunities and common prosperity in the region ofSouth-East Asia and the Asia-Pacific region at large.Cambodia also takes note that the ASEAN RegionalForum is an invaluable setting to discuss in a frank andfriendly manner security issues of common concern andinterest to all participants in the Forum  whether large orsmall countries around the world. The ASEAN RegionalForum has in fact already provided a sense of mutualconfidence  as reflected in the comfort felt by all thesenior officials and high representatives of theparticipating countries. It can be viewed as a first step inpreventive  quiet diplomacy  thereby paving the way foragreements on substantive issues in the coming yearsbased on the traditional consensus principle  whichcharacterizes ASEAN.Cambodia is particularly proud to be able toassociate itself with all the countries in the region and tosubstantially contribute to regional and world peacethrough the signing of the South-East Asia Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty on 15 December 1995. Thismarks real progress towards the creation of a zone ofpeace  freedom and neutrality in South-East Asia.Through the review of the Protocol to the Treaty  it is ourearnest hope that all nuclear-weapon States will accede tothe Treaty  in line with the aspirations of the peoples ofSouth-East Asia for a nuclear-weapon-free zone in thispart of the world.Cambodia’s position on the question of nuclearweapons has been and remains that a complete prohibitionof nuclear weapons and their destruction are basic to14world peace. Thus  a complete test ban will lead towardsthe ultimate objective of complete nuclear disarmament.The Kingdom of Cambodia is proud to have been able toco-sponsor and sign the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-BanTreaty  considered a significant step towards promotingnuclear disarmament. This will be the greatest service thatour generation can perform to free future generations fromthe terrible prospect of a world holocaust.While we are addressing the issue of the CTBT andthe ban on weapons of mass destruction  we should notoverlook the issue of landmines in various parts of theworld. Cambodia is the hardest hit nation in the world. TheRoyal Government and the people of Cambodia pay greattribute to all the generous donor countries that have assistedus in our efforts to rid the country of the scourge oflandmines. But how many millions of these cold  cruel andsilent enemies still await our unsuspecting and innocentcivilian population in remote areas of the country near thewestern border? Banning them is an easy job. We needinternational support to fully eradicate them.In his message to the Review Conference of the StatesParties to the 1980 Convention on Certain ConventionalWeapons last April  His Majesty Preah Bat Samdech PreahNorodom Sihanouk Varman  King of Cambodia  appealedto all countries and peoples  international organizations States and Governments to take  in a universal consensus concrete measures towards definitively outlawing  as soonas possible  the production  export  utilization and sale ofmines.The Kingdom of Cambodia is therefore gratified bythe recent Chairman’s statement for the Third ASEANRegional Forum held last July in Jakarta. On the issue ofthe global elimination of anti-personnel mines  the Forumwelcomed the decisions of several States to imposemoratoria and bans on the production  export andoperational use of these weapons. It recognized the need following conflict  for reinforcing international support forefforts to detect and remove landmines and to assistvictims. Cambodia welcomes the initiatives of the FederalRepublic of Germany and of Canada in this GeneralAssembly and gives its full support to the proposedresolutions.Permit me to inform you  Sir  and all distinguisheddelegates that my country is presently facing severe floodsaffecting 1.3 million people  or one tenth of our population.On behalf of the Royal Government of Cambodia and onmy own behalf  I would like to sincerely and deeply thankthe friendly Governments that have immediately givengenerous humanitarian assistance to our afflicted people.I would also like to take this opportunity to appeal to ourother friends to help relieve this blight.The Kingdom of Cambodia recognizes the need tofocus attention on such issues as the trafficking innarcotics and other criminal behaviour  which transcendnational borders and which can so intimately affect thelives of each one of our citizens and undermine our socialstructures. Such transnational issues do not appearamenable to resolution other than by immediate ongoingmanagement through shared information and coordination.Of particularly urgent concern is the issue of drugtrafficking.The Kingdom of Cambodia is a victim of a rapidescalation in the traffic of drugs transiting through itsterritory. Unfortunately  Cambodia at present lacks theappropriate legal  technical and financial means to dealeffectively with this problem. It nevertheless affirms itsstrong commitment to drug control through effectiveinternational cooperation. The Royal Government wishessincerely to thank the United States of America for itsstrong support under the United States-CambodiaAgreement to Counter Narcotics.Cambodia is pleased with the decision taken by theThird ASEAN Regional Forum to consider at the nextmeeting the question of drug trafficking and other relatedtransnational issues such as economic crimes  includingmoney laundering  which could constitute threats to thesecurity of the countries of the region.Through the good offices of the United Nations multilateral approaches to problems have provided usefulsources of information and highlighted issues close to thehearts of many of our citizens. The past summitconferences in Cairo  Copenhagen  Beijing and Istanbulhave contributed to the promotion of gender equality  andhave given recognition to the role of women and children the improvement of the quality of life through health careand adequate housing  respect for human rights  andprotection of the environment.A further vital  and perhaps fundamental  issue forthe attention of every member of the internationalcommunity must be that of the widening gap between richand poor nations. This gap and its effects on the qualityof life of the citizens of the developing world is directlyrelated to the nature  organization and health of the worldeconomy. Vital decisions determining the shape andnature of the world economy are  however  well outside15the control of a vast majority of nations  particularly thosein the third world.Since the Non-Aligned Summit in Jakarta in 1992  noindications have been observed of a rapid and solidrecovery in the world economy. Instabilities spread morequickly from one country to another  particularly todeveloping countries  which are now more vulnerable andsensitive to external factors. The continuing trend towardsa global economy  with the increasingly free flow of capitalthroughout the world without reference to national borders means that the ebbs and flows of the world economy havean almost immediate effect around the world. For manypoorer nations  this has resulted in an increased nationaldebt burden with the consequence of greater instability inthe daily lives of their citizens.Notions of competition are not realistic for countriesthat from the outset have a mammoth burden of debt limited access to technology  and populations ill-equippedto meet the challenges of the global economy. It isCambodia’s strong hope that through the United Nations wecan go a long way towards ameliorating this situation which is already at a crisis point for many nations in theworld community.Therefore  the democratization of internationaleconomic relations is essential to ensure that thedevelopment interests of developing countries will be takenfully into account. In this regard  it is also essential to placedevelopment cooperation at the centre of the United Nationsmandate  role and functions. To do this  the United Nationsitself needs to begin the process of reform so that it isbetter able to deal with the conditions of the new globaleconomy. The United Nations Conference on Trade andDevelopment (UNCTAD) and the United Nations IndustrialDevelopment Organization should play a key role as focalpoints of the United Nations system in the areas of tradeand development of developing countries. UNCTAD  inparticular  needs to study trends and issues in the worldeconomy  especially those that have an impact ondeveloping countries  and propose policies and measuresthat can address projected problems. For instance Generalized Special Preference (GSP) donors shouldsimplify and harmonize the rules of origin. By the sametoken  all political conditions attached to international trade development assistance and investment should cease. Theyrepresent  in fact  a new wave of protectionism.(spoke in French)The delegation of Cambodia is deeply concerned atthe financial crisis in the United Nations today. With itsmodest resources  Cambodia intends to meet itsresponsibilities to do what it can to ease the financialcrisis. But if this Organization is to continue to exist trueto the spirit of its Charter  an equitable and fair solutionmust be found  taking into account the need for sweepingreform in United Nations structures which must reflect therapid changes in various parts of the world that havetaken place since the end of the cold war.The broad reforms and restructuring of the UnitedNations must also extend to the Security Council toensure that its work is both democratic and moreeffective. In particular  Cambodia supports closer relationsbetween the Security Council and the General Assemblythrough greater accountability of the Council to theAssembly. Priority must be given to reform in economic social and other areas so as better to meet the challengesand take account of the economic priorities of developingcountries against the backdrop of globalization.As one of the founding members of the Non-AlignedMovement in 1956 in Brioni  Yugoslavia  Cambodia hasconsistently worked to promote solidarity amongMembers and cooperate in the search for lasting peace inthe world and economic development that goes hand inhand with social justice for all humankind.As His Majesty the King emphasized in his messageon the thirty-fifth anniversary of its creation  the Non-Aligned Movement is currently meeting challenges unlikethose that existed when it was established. Many loftyaspirations for national independence and freedom havebecome fact  but as His Majesty said:“The majority of our members still have to deal withhuge problems caused by unemployment  poverty famine  drought  landmines  illiteracy  deforestation racial discrimination and terrorism. We musttherefore try to reduce military expenditure and theproduction of landmines in order to devote ournational resources to the economic and socialdevelopment of our peoples.”In recent years  the world has seen severaldevelopments regarding the strengthening of regionalsecurity and political stability. First of all  the Kingdomof Cambodia wishes sincerely to welcome theestablishment of the Southern Philippines Council forPeace and Development and the peace process inMindanao. It fully supports the peace agreements16concluded between the Government of the Philippines andthe Moro National Liberation Front on 2 September 1996.These agreements will undoubtedly contribute to an end tothe conflict in the southern Philippines  bringing bothlasting peace to Mindanao and prosperity and nationalharmony to the fraternal people of the Philippines.Cambodia welcomes the Dayton Peace Agreement andthe signing on 14 December 1995 in Paris of the GeneralFramework for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina (theFramework Agreement) between the Republic of Bosniaand Herzegovina  the Republic of Croatia  the FederalRepublic of Yugoslavia and other concerned parties.Cambodia welcomes the announcement of the end ofthe war in Chechnya  thereby ending the suffering of thewarring parties  and particularly the innocent civilianpopulation.Cambodia welcomes progress made since August 1995in the Middle East peace process  particularly theimplementation of the Declaration of Principles on InterimSelf-Government Arrangements between the PalestineLiberation Organization and Israel  the Israeli-PalestinianInterim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip of28 September 1995  the first Palestinian elections on 20January 1996  as well as the beginning of negotiations onthe final status between the Palestinians and Israelis in Tabain May 1996. Cambodia calls for the continuation of thepeace talks  bearing in mind the inalienable right of thePalestinian people to self-determination and to anindependent State on its national territory with the supportof the international community.My country is deeply concerned at the recent situationin Afghanistan where war continues to bring death anddevastation. We hope that our Afghan brothers will be ableto overcome their differences and will soon find the path todialogue.With regard to the situation on the Korean peninsula Cambodia supports the reunification efforts of the Koreanpeoples on the basis of the principles set forth in the JointDeclaration on Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula of4 July 1972 and the accord of February 1992. We alsowelcome initiatives to formulate a definitive peaceagreement promoting solid peace and security on thepeninsula.In respect of Africa  the Royal Government ofCambodia welcomes the adoption by the General Assemblyof resolution 49/142. We are aware of the tremendousdifficulties facing African States in bringing developmentand prosperity to their respective peoples. Cambodia callsfor the speedy implementation of the United Nations NewAgenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s andthe consolidation of efforts to diversify the Africaneconomy. We hope that with the helping hand of theinternational community  particularly the donor countries this great continent will profit from the opportunitiesavailable to it and join in the efforts to achievesustainable development  a major challenge facing all thecountries of the world."
"90",3809,"KNA",51,1996,"﻿I should like tobegin my presentation by congratulating Mr. Razali Ismailon his election to the presidency of this session of theGeneral Assembly. It bears testimony to this Organization’sconfidence in and high regard for his skills and abilities.Also  I wish to express my gratitude to Mr. Freitas doAmaral for the efficient manner in which he presided overthe fiftieth anniversary session of the United Nations.At last year’s session  I spoke of the faith of theGovernment of Saint Kitts and Nevis in the United Nationsas the only global Organization able to balance the interestsof the weak against those of the strong. I spoke also of theneed for individual countries to work to develop approachesto collective problem-solving and partnership. Saint Kittsand Nevis reiterates this faith  which  I believe  is amplyjustified.Very recently the United Nations came to theassistance of my country and made available support andresources to aid the process of constitutional reform  which hopefully  will avert further fragmentation and preserve theintegrity of Saint Kitts and Nevis. I should like sincerely torecord my thanks to the Secretary-General for this kindgesture.I said previously that my Government does not ask forhand-outs. We do not expect charity. Our participation inthis forum is the result of our commitment tomultilateralism. All we ask for is genuine partnership opportunity and an environment in which we all canprosper.My party  while in opposition  developed an actionplan for the progressive growth of the people of SaintKitts and Nevis. Today  as the duly elected Government we have readily realized that the problems facing smalldeveloping States keep increasing. But this has notdiminished our resolve. One year ago  my Governmentbegan the difficult and trying task of implementing ourpolicies and devising new strategies to address thestubborn problems facing my country. We recognize thatthe coexistence in any society of the threat of narco-trafficking  youth unemployment and poverty is a recipefor social chaos. We in Saint Kitts and Nevis aretherefore committed to ensuring that the young peopleinherit a legacy of hope and live in an environment inwhich dreams are not only kept alive but are realized.We fully appreciate that the challenges ahead aregreat  but we also see great possibilities  and we aredetermined to embrace the opportunities. However  tomove our people forward we will require partnership; wecannot do it alone.To this end  I welcome with enthusiasm thestatement last week by the Secretary of State for Foreignand Commonwealth Affairs of the United Kingdom. I amencouraged by his intervention because it speaks to thefundamental issues that we in small States have for solong worked to bring to the top of the internationalagenda.Last year I appealed to Member States to commit toa genuine partnership between the developed and thedeveloping worlds. The developing world — small Statesin particular — have for far too long been languishing onthe periphery of international affairs and are oftencorralled into the mainstream only when issues of votesor candidatures are at the centre of debates and individualnational policies.The Secretary of State for Foreign andCommonwealth Affairs of the United Kingdom spoke ofthe need for the developed world to pursue policies thatwill allow the economies of developing countries toexpand through export-led growth and the abolition ofbarriers to trade in the developed world. I fully supportthis call. My delegation would like to see the BrettonWoods institutions come to the aid of small States bycreating adequate structures to allow these States todevelop economically and participate better in the world17system. There must be a period of transition to encouragesmall States to integrate into the mainstream ofinternational interaction.We all share a common responsibility to ensure thatdeveloping countries are more equitably integrated into theworld economic system. We must break the insidious cycleof dependency and replace it with bonds of partnership andcooperation. We are our brothers’ keepers. This must begiven priority in our national and international policies.The developed world must avoid outmodedperceptions that suggest that it is best qualified to prescribestrategies for growth in developing countries. Attention willalso have to be paid to indigenous priorities in developingcountries. I say to the Assembly that there can be noprescription without consultation. Attempts at developmentwithout recognizing the peculiar problems of small Statesand the responsibilities of the developed world will notpromote sustainable growth.We speak repeatedly of hope  and the promise of thenew millennium  yet sometimes overlook many of theproblems plaguing us today. My Government looks to thisnew era with great optimism and unbridled hope that wecan achieve sustainable development  that sustainablehuman growth can be realized  and that our people canafford to dream of a life beyond the expectations of theirforebears.However  I fear for our children’s dreams in a worldwhere the products of developing countries arediscriminated against and dubious tariffs make our goodsseem uncompetitive. I see definite cause for concern whenfriendly countries that are fully cognizant of the need forthe limited preferential access our region enjoys  pursuepolicies inimical to the development and growth of ourcountries. This strategy is not free trade. I fear for theprogress of my people when development is measured incold statistical terms that ignore social transformation andsustainable development.I fear for the future of my children if small  vulnerableStates such as my own are continuously graduated out ofaid-recipient-country status simply because the grossnational product per capita is considered high. This policydoes not take into account our high per capita cost ofinfrastructure development; it does not take into account thefrequency of hurricanes and other natural disasters  or thediseconomy of scale faced by our small enterprises.I fear for my brothers and sisters in the WindwardIslands  whose very livelihood is threatened and could beseriously undermined by the disputes over WindwardIsland banana exports. If the economies of the WindwardIslands are affected  my country  too  will suffer. Oureconomies are very closely linked. We share a commoncurrency  a common central bank and  of course  acommon future.It seems that the international community wouldreadily punish growth. Whenever small States experiencerelative growth  instead of lending further assistance toensure that they emerge from the quagmire of deepeningpoverty  necessary resources and support systems aretaken away  and these countries find themselves beinggraduated out of concessional assistance programmes.This is wrong. This is inhumane. When we rob a man ofthe means to feed and educate himself and his family how can we expect him to contribute productively to civilsociety? This is a world of people  and its organizationmust be about people. Their needs should not becomesecondary to systems  policies and experiments. Structuresshould be used to further the goals and aspirations of ourpeoples despite differences in economies  populations andsize. Our peoples all share a common dream: the dreamof freedom to chart their own destinies; the dream of self-reliance; the dream of a better standard of living.On the question of the environment  it isinconceivable that the very countries that agree tocontribute to coastal erosion management and fund studieson environmental protection would wish to trans-shiphazardous toxic waste through our waterways. Thefragility of my region’s ecosystems  the openness of theeconomies  the overwhelming reliance on food imports and the susceptibility of the tourism product put usprecariously  and  perhaps  uniquely  at the mercy ofexternal forces.Saint Kitts and Nevis intends to preserve thestandard of living we have achieved and to ensure aprosperous future for all of our peoples. My Governmentstrongly urges the international community to respect ourdetermination to make the Caribbean a nuclear-free zoneand to keep it free from toxic pollutants. The regionalready suffers from the consequences of rising sea levels coastal erosion and the destructive effects of naturaldisasters. The catalogue is very long; we cannot addfurther problems to it.Small island developing States require committed long-term assistance in environmental protection. I am18convinced that sustainable development and environmentalpreservation are inexorably linked. We cannot make tokengestures of support on one level only to undermine supporton another. We need to enforce existing internationalinstruments  promote cooperation and allow the UnitedNations to play a more central and coordinating role indeveloping appropriate machinery for bringing togetherpolitical will and financial and technological resources toguarantee results.I call on the United Nations to devise a comprehensiveand integrated approach to addressing sustainabledevelopment. Additionally  I urge developing countries towork more closely together to develop indigenous strategiesand innovative approaches in order to solve the problems ofdevelopment.The plethora of issues which come before the UnitedNations are critical. Therefore  it is necessary that theUnited Nations undergo substantive reform that will addressresource distribution and the implementation ofrecommendations. We must be careful not to addressreform in a superficial way. We have to commit ourselvesto reforms which allow the Organization to respond moreeffectively to the problems which face Member States.It is our collective responsibility to restore andstrengthen the international agenda of the United Nationsand support its role and performance in the social institutional and economic fields. I believe that theOrganization can help to fuse our individual and collectivegoals. However  Member countries must believe in theinternational relevance of this Organization.It is important for us to promote consensus inaddressing the important questions of budgetary andadministrative reform of this  our Organization.Irrespective of national ambitions  irrespective of sizeor resources  the United Nations is the only globalinstitution whose membership gives it the mandate toexamine the vast array of problems that affect the entirecommunity of nations.The work being undertaken to reform the UnitedNations should be structured in such a way as to eliminateunnecessary wastage and bureaucratic inefficiency. At thesame time  we should not use the problems as an excuse todiminish our commitment to the strengthening and re-energizing of the United Nations.When we look at international affairs  democracy isstill one of our most sacred aspirations. But it needstangible institutional and infrastructural support. MyGovernment welcomes the extension of the UnitedNations mission in Haiti which we believe is crucial toconsolidating and furthering the cause of democracy andhuman resource development in Haiti. We should notexpect to strengthen democracy in Haiti withoutaddressing the systemic causes of poverty  illiteracy andviolence and the absence of democratic institutions. Thepeople of Haiti will eventually inherit the rewards ofpeace when commitment to long-term social  political andeconomic development is assured. It is unwise for Statesto use politics and partisanship to impede progress inHaiti. Its people long for an opportunity to becomemasters of their own fate  and they should be given thatchance to pursue their national aspirations.My delegation welcomes the prospects for peace inBosnia and Herzegovina and the progress towardsimplementing the recommendations of the DaytonAccords. We welcome the willingness of the parties todevelop democratic institutions  enhance human rights andsee to the return and settlement of displaced persons. Thesituation in this region is still quite fragile. We mustcontinue to struggle for peace  and people must be madeto believe that such atrocities will never  ever happenagain.The situation in the Middle East has regrettablytaken a turn for the worse. I appeal to the region’sGovernments to recommit themselves to peace  the onlyviable option for attaining coexistence  security  stabilityand genuine progress for all parties concerned. We furtherurge the Governments to continue to respect theagreements reached and to commit to theirimplementation. The successes of past years should neverbe squandered.The Government of Saint Kitts and Nevis lends itssupport to the work of the International Criminal Tribunalfor Rwanda and commends the work of the UnitedNations and the Organization of African Unity inattempting to resolve these challenging and often thornyissues. We also urge all factions in Burundi to givenegotiations a fighting chance. Violence breeds violence but peace gives birth to partnership. Peace gives birth togrowth and to economic development.We have circulated a document which reflects ourpolicy regarding Taiwan. Our policy is to respect theterritorial integrity of all countries and to refrain from19interference in the internal affairs of all Member States.Because of our traditional relationship with the 21.3 millionpeople on Taiwan  we have come to respect their economicstability and progress. Their growing democracy and theircontribution to the developing world have not goneunnoticed.We believe they have an important and continuing roleto play in international development strategies. We areconfident that whatever difficulties exist between theChinese people separated by the Taiwan Strait can beresolved by the Chinese people themselves and in a spiritof fraternity and good will. We urge the internationalcommunity to be ready  if necessary  to provide themechanisms to facilitate dialogue and cooperation.Resolution of the stalemate would significantly contributeto the cause of development worldwide and to peace andsecurity in the region.We look forward to the implementation of thePlatform for Action adopted at the Fourth WorldConference on Women in Beijing. My Government believesthat this is a significant step and a triumph for all womenworldwide. It will allow them to achieve full equality ofopportunity and equitable integration into the mainstream ofdecision-making and the development process.We should bear in mind when discussing the questionof human rights that we commit a fundamental error byselectively disregarding the right to economic survival andsocial well-being. When we single out human rights andfreedom we do grave injustice to those people languishingbelow the poverty line  unable to determine the course oftheir own lives.Fundamental to achieving tangible results is thenecessity of adopting a comprehensive and wholesomeapproach to human rights. It is not nearly enough to ensurepolitical suffrage and freedom of expression  although theseare extremely important  without establishing mechanismsto foster social self-reliance and economic independence.To promote human rights in the wider sense is tocomplement and consolidate a democratic culture withinany given society.Human rights protection also means protecting therights of children against hunger  against mental andphysical abuse  against prostitution  against trafficking inchildren and against pornography. Therefore  we mustattack the ills of poverty  illiteracy and deprivation andenact punitive legislation. We support the first internationalconference on the sexual exploitation of minors  held inStockholm  as a significant step and an importantinitiative to raise awareness and develop strategies.In conclusion  I challenge the internationalcommunity to give effect to promises with solutions andtangible results. If we fail to design appropriate strategiestoday to address present problems  we are doomed torepeat past mistakes.The time for action is overdue. Please  we can waitno longer and we must delay no longer."
"91",3835,"KOR",51,1996,"﻿On behalf of theGovernment and the people of the Republic of Korea  Sir I would like to express my sincere congratulations on yourassumption of the presidency of the fifty-first session of theGeneral Assembly. We are confident that under your ableleadership the Assembly will take action to revitalize theworld Organization  building on the foundation laid by yourpredecessor  Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral of Portugal. Mygratitude goes also to the Secretary-General  Mr. BoutrosBoutros-Ghali  and the staff of the Secretariat for theirexcellent work for this session.The most pressing business of this Assembly is tocreate the architecture for United Nations renewal. TheMember States  with vision and determination  need toconstruct step by step a consensus on reform that will notonly bring the Organization out of its present crisis  but willalso prepare the world community to meet the challenges ofthe twenty-first century. We welcome the ongoing effortsto strengthen and revitalize the United Nations. But at thesame time we must admit that unless progress is acceleratedin the months ahead  there is a real danger that themomentum and sense of purpose spawned by the fiftiethanniversary could well be lost.My Government actively supports the various workinggroups of the General Assembly as they seek ways to makethe United Nations more effective  efficient and democratic.As a member of the Group of Sixteen States in support ofrenewing multilateralism  we are also pleased to activelyparticipate in the efforts to enhance the principle ofmultilateralism. The Group’s joint statement embodying thisprinciple was reported to the General Assembly lastWednesday by Prime Minister Persson of Sweden  onbehalf of the 16 Heads of State or Government.All these efforts  however  will be of no use ifMember States fail either to meet their financialobligations or to make the political compromisesnecessary to produce a durable package of reforms. Let usnot forget that the very principles of multilateralism onwhich the United Nations was founded are at risk. As wasso aptly put by the President of the General Assembly inhis 17 September inaugural speech  “the syndrome ofbusiness as usual'” (Official Records of the GeneralAssembly  Fifty-first Session  Plenary Meetings  1stmeeting  p. 3) must be discarded.Our Organization is in serious financial trouble dueto the arrears and outstanding contributions of MemberStates. The Security Council needs to be modernized toreflect the expansion in United Nations membership  to bemore equitably balanced geographically and to workefficiently  transparently and democratically. To betterserve the needs of economic development and to reduceduplication  we should undertake a sweeping reassessmentof the scores of subsidiary bodies of the Economic andSocial Council and of the Assembly itself. While wewelcome General Assembly resolution 50/227 as a step inthe right direction  much more needs to be done. Historywill not judge the United Nations on how manycommittees it forms or how many resolutions it passes but on how much it does on the ground  day in and dayout  to further peace  prosperity and justice for theworld’s peoples.Today I would like to focus my remarks on fourmajor challenges facing the United Nations and then tosay a few words about the situation on the Koreanpeninsula.In considering the architecture for United Nationsrenewal  we should shape an Organization better preparedto respond to the following four priority needs: first restraining the proliferation of dangerous and destructiveweaponry; secondly  bolstering United Nations capabilitiesfor effective peacekeeping and peace-building; thirdly assisting economic and social development whileenhancing protection of the environment; and fourthly improving mechanisms for ensuring respect forinternational law and human rights.Calls for a new international order will ring hollowwithout more reliable controls on the spread of dangerousarmaments  particularly those capable of mass destruction.As a supporter of the early conclusion of a comprehensivetest-ban treaty (CTBT)  my Government heartily welcomedthe long-awaited adoption of the Treaty earlier this month.The conclusion of the CTBT will help curb nuclearproliferation in all its forms and will contribute towardsnuclear disarmament. As an original signatory to the CTBT the Republic of Korea aims to ratify the Treaty swiftly. Inorder for the CTBT to become universal and verifiable  myGovernment urges all countries to accede to the Treaty atthe earliest possible date.While the Conference on Disarmament failed to reachconsensus on the CTBT  the Conference  through two anda half years of intense negotiations  was instrumental inarticulating the eventual Treaty. I would like to take thisopportunity to pay tribute to the Conference and to assurethe Assembly that the Republic of Korea  as a new memberof the Conference  will spare no efforts to contribute to itsvital work.Despite much progress towards a world free of nuclearweapons  the Korean peninsula still faces the threat ofnuclear proliferation. North Korea has yet to achievenuclear transparency. Once again  my delegation urgesNorth Korea to comply with its obligations under the Treatyon the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) andInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards ina comprehensive manner  and to implement fully andfaithfully the Framework Agreement between the UnitedStates and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. Wealso renew our call on North Korea to live up to itsobligations under the South-North Joint Declaration on theDenuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.Until they are eliminated from the face of the Earth chemical and biological weapons too will pose a gravethreat to humanity. Towards this end  the Republic ofKorea  as an original signatory to the chemical weaponsConvention in 1993  recently concluded the domesticprocedures to ratify the Convention. We look forward to itsswift entry into force  for universal adherence to theConvention is critical to achieving a total ban on chemicalweapons. My delegation therefore strongly urges thosecountries which have not yet joined the Convention including the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea  to doso as early as possible.Moreover  my Government  which acceded to thebiological weapons Convention supports the efforts tointroduce a strict verification system into the Convention.Both of these non-proliferation measures are essentialbuilding blocks for world peace.My Government  moreover  shares the internationalconcern over the millions of anti-personnel landminesscattered throughout the world. We are looking forwardto working closely with other Member States to minimizethe suffering and casualties among innocent civilianscaused by these indiscriminate weapons. To this end  I ampleased to announce that the Republic of Korea will againextend its moratorium on the export of anti-personnelmines for another year.The second priority for United Nations renewalshould be to adapt and bolster its uniquely valuablepeacekeeping and peace- building work to meet newchallenges. Following several years of rising expectationsand expanding mandates  Member States have developedover the past two years a more sober appreciation notonly of the limits of United Nations capabilities but  moreimportant  of their own willingness to provide therequisite material and human support for a moreambitious role for the world body. Both the scope and thenature of peacekeeping operations are being tested as thedemands for United Nations involvement remain high ina world confronted by an alarming number of intra-Stateconflicts and acts of terrorism.Today’s peacekeepers are often required to undertakediverse tasks such as monitoring violations of humanrights  staging elections  rehabilitating civic institutionsand reintegrating combatants and refugees into peacetimesociety. Thus  peacekeeping now directly contributes topeace-building and conflict prevention. Post-conflictpeace-building  by rehabilitating a country’s war-ravagedeconomic and social base  can serve to prevent therecurrence of conflict. Member States should recognize however  that the broadening of peacekeeping objectivesshould be matched by an expansion in the resources andcapabilities of the United Nations for carrying out thesetasks. Peace  too  has a price.Recently  several promising proposals have been putforward for enhancing the rapid deployment capability ofthe United Nations. We consider the United Nationssystem of standby arrangements — currently comprisingof 59 countries  including the Republic of Korea — to bean innovative and practical mechanism for coping withemergency situations. We also believe that the growinginterest and participation of Member States have boostedthe credibility of the system of standby arrangements making it easier to secure the consent of parties in a12given conflict to United Nations peacekeeping involvement.In addition  we support the establishment of a rapidlydeployable headquarters team within the Department ofPeacekeeping Operations  as proposed by the friends ofrapid deployment. The Korean Government is willing todetail personnel to the team as part of our contribution tostrengthening the United Nations rapid deploymentcapability.Since we first dispatched an engineering unit to theUnited Nations peacekeeping operation in Somalia in 1993 the Republic of Korea has contributed to manypeacekeeping operations around the world. We intend toexpand our participation in terms of human resources  andmaterial and political support for practical steps to improvethe peace-management capacity of the United Nations.In an uncertain world  terrorism poses an ever-presentthreat to international and domestic peace and security.Having been a direct victim of terrorism  the Republic ofKorea strongly condemns all acts of terrorism. We urge theinternational community to take firm action to contain andcombat terrorism. The 1994 Declaration on Measures toEliminate International Terrorism clearly states thatterrorism in all forms is not only criminal  but alsounjustifiable under any circumstances  regardless ofpolitical  ideological  ethnic or racial motivation. MyGovernment reaffirms its strong commitment to join theongoing efforts to eradicate terrorism worldwide.Economic and social development should also remaina high priority at a time when scientific progress andinformation technology are globalizing the world economyat a rapid pace. Driven by unprecedented levels of cross-border trade and investment  globalization presents newopportunities to bolster economic development and improvequality of life. Nonetheless  we must not lose sight of thedetrimental effects of this trend  which threaten to leavesome developing countries increasingly marginalized.The United Nations has an obligation to try to helpthose least developed countries  particularly in Africa  thatare truly in need. My delegation fully supports the UnitedNations System-wide Special Initiative for development inAfrica  a joint undertaking by the United Nations and theBretton Woods institutions launched last March. We lookforward to joining other Member States in a common effortto bring this worthy endeavour to fruition.Having risen from the devastation of the Korean War the Republic of Korea has achieved sustained economicgrowth and advancements in living standards over the pastthree decades. Seeking to share the lessons of our owndevelopment experience  we have worked to help otherdeveloping countries apply two key elements of our owngrowth: capacity-building and human resourcedevelopment. The Korean International CooperationAgency is implementing diverse programs to assist otherdeveloping countries in this regard. At the same time Korea will increase its voluntary contribution to theoperational activities of the United Nations by 120 percent during 1996-97. In these and many other ways  weare determined to participate in United Nations efforts tobring about economic and social progress throughout theworld.Since 1994  my Government has worked with theUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP) toestablish the International Vaccine Institute in Seoul. ThisInstitute will be dedicated to capacity-building fordeveloping countries in the development and use ofvaccines  particularly for children and the impoverished.The official launching of the International VaccineInstitute will take place in New York on 28 October. Wewould encourage as many countries as possible to showtheir support for this worthy and noble project bybecoming party to the agreement.The emergence of unprecedented globalenvironmental issues  such as climate change andbiodiversity  calls for genuine global partnership based onequitable burden-sharing. The special session onenvironmental issues of the General Assembly in 1997will provide us with a valuable opportunity to formulatea clear  sustainable development strategy for the twenty-first century. On 5 June 1997  immediately before thespecial session  my Government will co-host WorldEnvironment Day  together with the United NationsEnvironment Programme (UNEP)  as part of our effortsto contribute to the resolution of environmental issues.The fourth theme for United Nations renewal  in ourview  should be to reinforce the unique United Nationscapacity for codifying  monitoring and encouragingrespect for international law and human rights. As theCharter so eloquently attests  genuine peace and stabilitydepend upon a healthy respect for international law andhuman rights norms. The continuing United Nationscommitment to human rights and social justice wasreaffirmed by a series of international conferences duringthe 1990s. They include the Vienna World Conference onHuman Rights  in 1993  and the Fourth World Conferenceon Women  held in Beijing in 1995.13In particular  the Beijing Conference underscored thecritical principle that gender equality — through theprotection of women’s human rights and the eradication ofall forms of violence against women — forms thefoundation of a sound and prosperous society. The Republicof Korea is committed to maintaining its support forinternational efforts to advance the status of women.All of us need to do more  however  to help theUnited Nations live up to its potential for promoting humanrights. Its mechanisms for furthering respect for universalhuman rights need to be reinforced and upgraded across theboard. We need to enhance the coordinating role of theHigh Commissioner for Human Rights and of the resourcesof the Centre for Human Rights. The Korean Governmentwill do its best to make a meaningful contribution to thisend.Envisioned since the Nuremberg and Tokyo Tribunalsof a half century ago  the idea of an international court topunish crimes against humanity is now being materialized even as the Yugoslavia and Rwanda Tribunals arestruggling to bring to justice criminals who have committedgenocide and other mass crimes. A preparatory committeeis refining the draft statute of the international criminalcourt  prepared by the International Law Commission. Welook forward to the early establishment of the court  whichwe believe will deter violators of human rights. We alsowelcome the establishment of the International Tribunal forthe Law of the Sea  which should contribute significantlyto the strengthening of international law and order.The road to democracy in the Republic of Korea hasbeen long and difficult. Indeed  laying the foundation fordemocracy in a developing country is never easy. Itrequires a vigilant public conscious of democracy andhuman rights and a government willing to nurture the willof its citizens. This has been and will remain a primaryobjective of the Korean Government. We are making everyeffort to promote further human rights and democracythrough the enhancement of our legal and institutionalmechanisms.My Government has also been active in the endeavourto assist the democratic impulse throughout the world.Lending our support to the electoral assistance activities ofthe Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe we provided a dozen election monitors  as well as supplies for the international operation to ensure free and fairelections in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In the past  we alsoparticipated in the electoral observer missions inMozambique  Cambodia  South Africa and Palestine.Let me now turn to the situation on the Koreanpeninsula. Despite the easing of tensions worldwide sincethe end of the cold war  the Korean peninsula continuesto be a source of instability  posing threats to the peaceand security of north-east Asia and beyond.Unfortunately  the tides of openness and reconciliationthat swept other parts of the world have not yet reachedthe Korean peninsula  the last remaining legacy of thecold war.Last week North Korea dispatched a militarysubmarine to infiltrate armed commandos into the South.We uncovered this infiltration when the submarine ranaground on the shore of Kangrung  a city on the SouthKorean east coast  and 26 armed agents are believed tohave come ashore. Of these  21 were killed and one wascaptured. According to the captured agent  the armedinfiltrators were all military officers from the NorthKorean defence ministry. Subsequent examinations alsorevealed shocking findings. The 11 North Koreans founddead on the day of the landing were apparently killed bytheir cohorts for reasons unknown.The investigation is still under way to find out thepurpose of the infiltration and other details  but thefindings to date present a strong possibility that lastweek’s infiltration is part of a larger-scale infiltrationoperation.This brazen act of military provocation by NorthKorea constitutes not only a serious infringement of ourterritorial waters and sovereignty  but also a blatantviolation of the Armistice Agreement. It also clearlydemonstrates that North Korea still seeks Koreanreunification by any means  including the use of force.Needless to say  this act of provocation poses a directthreat to peace and stability on and around the Koreanpeninsula.We once again urge North Korea immediately torenounce its absurd goal of unifying Korea by force andto pursue peaceful coexistence with the South. The Northshould also abide by the Armistice Agreement and endany attempt to disrupt the current armistice regime.We also take this opportunity to renew our call onNorth Korea to accept our proposal for four-party talksinvolving both Koreas  China and the United States which will enable constructive negotiations for theestablishment of a lasting peace on the peninsula. In theabsence of Pyongyang’s positive response and given theseriousness of North Korea’s violation of the armistice 14my country firmly believes that the Armistice Agreementshould remain in full force.At the historic fiftieth session of the GeneralAssembly  we took a collective look at where the UnitedNations had been and where it was going. In an open andforward-looking spirit  we compared visions of the kind ofworld body that will be needed to meet the challenges ofthe twenty-first century. Now  with this fifty-first session comes the hard part: redoubling our collective commitmentto the world body so that it can become a means fortranslating our visions into realities.Together  we can fashion the architecture of UnitedNations renewal. Can we achieve harmony out of diversity?Can we refocus our energies on the four priorities ofstemming the spread of weapons of mass destruction bolstering United Nations peacekeeping and peace-buildingcapabilities  advancing sustainable economic and socialdevelopment  and reinforcing our joint commitment tointernational law and human rights? The answer to thesequestions must be a resounding collective “yes”. TheRepublic of Korea stands ready to make its share ofcontributions  through the United Nations  to meet thechallenges of the next century."
"92",3881,"KWT",51,1996,"﻿On behalf of the State of Kuwait  it gives megreat pleasure to extend to Mr. Razali our sincerecongratulations on his election as President of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-first session.Given his personal experience and wisdom  webelieve that he will be able to guide our discussionsefficiently towards a successful conclusion. Since herepresents a sister Muslim country  I am particularlypleased to take this opportunity to underscore the firmbonds of brotherhood in Islam between Malaysia andKuwait.I am pleased to use this occasion also  to pay tributeto the President of the previous session of the Assemblyfor his outstanding efforts and contributions during thathistoric session.Kuwait views with pride and acknowledgement theimpressive performance of the Secretary-General  HisExcellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  especially hisleading role in and commitment to the enhancement ofthe functioning of the world Organization in the areas ofglobal peace  security and development. Mr. Boutros-Ghali has consistently worked to restructure the UnitedNations to bring it more into line with the aspirations andexpectations attached to it. I want to make specialmention of the concrete steps the Secretary-General hastaken to curb and rationalize expenditures  to streamlinethe administrative structure  and to reorganize theSecretariat in order to reflect current realities in the globalarena. Hence  Kuwait subscribes to the position adoptedby the League of Arab States and the Organization ofAfrican Unity (OAU) in supporting the Secretary-General’s bid to remain on board in order to pursue hisreform programme for the revitalization of the UnitedNations.19Last year  the family of nations observed the fiftiethanniversary of the establishment of the United Nationsagainst a backdrop of universal recognition of thewonderful achievements of the United Nations system. Therecord includes  to cite only a few areas: assistance in theattainment of national independence by many States; theestablishment of the principles contained in the Charter including the right to self-determination; the consolidationof codes of civilized conduct among States; the upholdingof justice and equality; and the promotion of economic andsocial development. Perhaps the most shining success of theUnited Nations is the peacekeeping operations it carries outin many volatile regions of the world. Such operations haverecently assumed a new humanitarian dimension in theform of relief efforts in cases of natural disasters and civilwar  and election monitoring.We view the United Nations as a forum for debatingthe future of humankind among nations  with a view topromoting the well-being  dignity and basic freedoms of thehuman person. The ever-increasing complexity ofcontemporary life in this global village and the ever-changing set of common and pressing issues which continueto emerge require a concerted international effort throughthe United Nations. By the same token  we must admit thatthere are gargantuan challenges that continue to face theUnited Nations  most poignantly the ethnic and regionalconflicts that endanger regional stability and theinternational security system. Other pressing issues includethe population explosion  environmental degradation  thewater shortage  desertification  the food deficit  the growinggap between the North and the South  the regional armsrace  the threat posed by nuclear weapons  the proliferationof weapons of mass destruction  development concerns barriers to economic and trade cooperation  the removal ofrestrictions on free trade and  last but not least  humanrights.To rally all States members of the world communityround ways to deal with the fundamental transformationsthat face the world  we must: believe in the energy potential and mechanisms of the United nations system tobe able to address global concerns in a multilateral fashion;provide enthusiastic financial  political and moral supportfor the United Nations and identify with its principles andpurposes; fully pay assessed contributions to the UnitedNations budget; and actively pursue a genuinely peacefulpolicy that recognizes and respects the rights and legitimateconcerns of other Member States  with a view to buildingup a regional order in line with the norms of internationalbehaviour. Accordingly  regional arrangements should beanchored in the established codes of justice and rules ofinternational law and treaties. Here we must ensurerespect for human rights  and protect human dignity andthe freedom of choice. In this context  humandevelopment without discrimination is essential for theoverall economic and social development of society. Toppriority should be given to this goal rather than tosquandering national resources on weaponry. We mustface up to terrorism and muster the national will to workcollectively on a global level to stamp out the root causesof this plague which afflicts both the weak and the strong the poor and the rich  for  in the final analysis  terrorismis not susceptible to reason; it stems from bigotry traumatizes the innocent  resorts to violence and seeks nodialogue.Against this backdrop  the indisputable fact remainsthat today’s world is interdependent in its security as wellas in its general concerns. The affluent few may not beable to live in exclusive comfort while a majority ofhumankind is marginalized in deprivation and poverty.Here emerges the stark need for a collective conceptualand material effort to develop a common agenda for thebenefit of all human beings.It is from this perspective that we view thesignificance of the revitalization and refashioning ofUnited Nations organs to keep abreast of the rapiddevelopment of international relations. In this context Kuwait is following closely the ongoing discussions in theOpen-Ended Working Group on the Question of EquitableRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of theSecurity Council. We had hoped that consensus wouldhave been reached on the restructuring and reform of theSecurity Council to coincide with the celebration of thefiftieth anniversary of the United Nations last year.Failure to attain that goal so far should not dampen ourhopes. Rather  we should redouble our efforts towardsthat end. Our aim should be a Security Council whosework and procedures are more transparent. Its resolutionsshould reflect more faithfully the will of the universalmembership of the United Nations. Its composition shouldbe expanded to reflect the recent increase in membership sovereign equality among States and the equitablegeographical distribution of seats among the variousregional groups.Any reform of the Security Council must in the endensure collective efforts by both members of the Counciland other members of the international community torespect and implement its resolutions. The Council shouldbe able to demonstrate its firm resolve against any regimethat does not comply with Council resolutions.20A textbook case in point is the just position towardsthe Iraqi regime adopted by the Council and supported bythe international community as a whole. As recently as23 June 1996  leaders of Arab States  in the final statementissued at the end of the extraordinary Arab Summit inCairo  urged the Iraqi Government:“not to embark on any aggressive policies aimed atprovoking its Arab neighbours and to implement infull all the relevant Security Council resolutions andespecially those requiring it to take the necessarymeasures to release all Kuwaiti and third-countryprisoners and detainees  to return the property seizedand to comply with the compensation mechanism.They regard this as the right way to ensure that thesanctions imposed on Iraq are lifted and theappropriate conditions created for Iraq to resume itsrole in the inter-Arab regional order.” (A/50/986 appendix  p. 7)This statement shows a recognition by the Arableaders of the nature of the Iraqi regime and theirappreciation for the importance of the full implementationof all relevant Security Council resolutions. Hence  Iraqmust cooperate sincerely with the International Committeeof the Red Cross in order to account for all Kuwaiti andthird-country prisoners and detainees  so that the chapter onthis human tragedy can be closed. We must note with regrethere that the Tripartite Commission  which meets everythree months in Geneva  and its Technical Subcommittee which meets monthly on issues relating to the borderbetween Iraq and Kuwait  have so far gotten nowhere. Inpoint of fact  the Iraqi regime exploits such meetings forpropaganda purposes.I must reiterate here that this question of prisoners andhostages remains a human tragedy precipitated by the Iraqiregime. And it remains a top-priority humanitarian issue forthe people and Government of Kuwait.The Iraqi regime is legally bound to cooperate withthe United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) ineliminating its arsenal of weapons of mass destruction.UNSCOM's bitter experience shows that the Iraqi regimewill not pass up any opportunity to use it for deception misinformation and the concealment of required data. Iteven went so far as to block repeatedly the work ofUNSCOM inspectors as recently as March  June andAugust of this year  thus prompting the Security Council toadopt resolution 1060 (1996) in addition to presidentialstatements issued by way of warning to the Iraqi regime.Kuwait  keen as it is on ensuring the safety andstability of the region  supports UNSCOM efforts. Indeed we commend UNSCOM for its resolve and its insistenceon the absolute necessity of implementing all provisionsrelating to the liquidation of Iraq’s weapons of massdestruction.Given the human suffering of the brotherly people ofIraq emanating from the policies of the ruling regime Kuwait continues to provide humanitarian relief assistancein kind to the Iraqi refugees. We also welcomed theaccord reached between Iraq and the United Nations onthe implementation of Security Council resolution 986(1995) as a step forward towards alleviating the sufferingof the Iraqi people.Let me take this occasion to reiterate Kuwait’sposition that Iraq’s unity and territorial integrity must bepreserved. In the meantime  we understand — indeedappreciate — all measures taken by the Coalition Statesin order to ensure the full implementation by Iraq of allrelevant Security Council resolutions. The essence andthrust of these resolutions is the evolution of a regionalorder anchored in the established principles of justice andstability  the rule of law  observance of the norms ofinternational behaviour  and respect for internationaltreaties  at the core of which is the Charter of the UnitedNations.In view of Kuwait’s concern for peace and securityin the Arabian Gulf region  and by virtue of our closerelations with our sister State  the United Arab Emirates and with our friendly neighbour  the Islamic Republic ofIran  Kuwait associates itself with the position of the GulfCooperation Council (GCC) regarding the issue of theislands. Kuwait calls upon the two parties to continuetheir negotiations in a bid to reach a just and peacefulsettlement through dialogue.On another regional matter  Kuwait fully supportsthe sister State of Bahrain in the recent measures it tookto combat terrorism with a view to consolidating itssecurity and stability. Our position is in harmony with theprinciple that the GCC member States have a commondestiny  and their security and stability are thereforeindivisible.Kuwait has been following with grave concern thestalling of the Middle East peace process following theelection of a new Government in Israel  which adopted aseries of positions that contradict the arrangementsworked out in Madrid  primarily the land-for-peace21formula and the implementation of Security Councilresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) towards acomprehensive peace in the Middle East.The recent Cairo summit document underscored theadherence by the Arab States to the peace process  in orderto achieve the ultimate goal of a just and comprehensivepeace  as a strategic option under the umbrella ofinternational law. The Arab position requires a matchingcommitment by Israel to work in a sincere and forthrightfashion all the way through until the overall peace processis completed. This must include the restoration of rights andthe return of occupied territories  as well as ensuringsecurity and a strategic balance of all States of the region in accordance with the principles laid down in Madrid.For the record  let me recall in this context thatKuwait put the question of Palestine among its topconcerns. In point of fact  that issue has been central to ourrelations with other members of the internationalcommunity. We have channelled enormous effort andresources into this cause  since Kuwait has always believedthat Israel has not recognized the legitimate rights of thePalestinian people to self-determination and statehood — letalone the fact that it has seized Palestinian territory in totaldisregard of United Nations resolutions and by using forceas a means of imposing faits accomplis. We demand thatthe Israeli Government stop its settlement activities in thePalestinian territories  especially in the Holy City ofJerusalem  and that it cease forthwith all changes to itsArab character and legal status. The refugee problem mustalso be resolved according to United Nations resolutions.Finally  a Palestinian state must be established withJerusalem as its capital  in accordance with the will of thePalestinian people.In this context  we condemn the steps taken by Israelin commissioning and excavating a tunnel under thewestern wall of the Al-Aqsa Mosque. This constitutes adesecration of that holy site and is a provocation to thepeople of Palestine — indeed to all Arabs and Muslimsthroughout the world. The use of great force and violenceby Israel has left many people dead or wounded. Wedemand that Israel put an immediate end to these practicesand that it fulfil its obligations to preserve the Arabic andIslamic character of these holy places.Lasting and comprehensive peace requires mutualaccommodation of the parties’ rights  compliance withaccords concluded  action in good faith  avoidance ofprovocative acts  and long-term vision — all with a viewnot to inflict injury on any major party to the peaceequation.Withdrawal by Israel from the Golan is a litmus testof its good intentions to achieve a just and balancedpeace. Therefore  Kuwait supports Syria’s position thatnegotiations should resume from the point at which theyceased  in view of the fact that the peace process is acontinuum that should not stop before reaching itsultimate destination.Kuwait also supports Lebanon in its legitimateinsistence that Israel must fulfil all provisions of SecurityCouncil resolution 425 (1978)  under which Israel mustwithdraw fully and unconditionally from all Lebaneseterritory under occupation.We believe that  in the final analysis  world peace isindivisible and that consequently  the question of globalsecurity has worldwide ramifications. Hence we think thatthe issues of ethnic strife and civil war should remain onthe international agenda. Thus  we welcome the peacefulmeasures taken thus far in the Republic of Bosnia andHerzegovina with a view to bringing that tragedy to anend while ensuring that the people of that Republic areaccorded their legitimate rights. We also welcome theoutcome of the recently held elections there andcongratulate President Alija Izetbegovic´ on the well-deserved confidence placed in him.We also call upon the international community topursue its efforts towards ending the current tragedies thatafflict Somalia  Afghanistan and Burundi. In the samevein  we hope that the peoples of those countries will beresponsive to the efforts of the international community.Kuwait notes with satisfaction the success of theUnited Nations earlier this month in the adoption of theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT)  whichis the culmination of a long-standing universal effort andof hopes for a safer world. Indeed  the CTBT representsan essential step forward on the path towards theelimination of nuclear weapons.Cooperation among member States of theinternational community in the economic and tradespheres has engendered a welcome openness followingthe conclusion of the world free trade agreement. Wehope that this accord will expand the volume of thedeveloping countries’ exports to the world markets.Kuwait was in the vanguard of advocating the removal oftrade barriers simply because we believe that  in the22context of an interdependent globe  collective politicalsecurity cannot be isolated from the economic concerns ofnations. Against this background  we welcome the stepsalready taken by some developing countries to readjust theireconomic approaches towards genuine openness and theadoption of free-market policies. In our view  this type ofrestructuring will help attract foreign investments andaccelerate the transfer of technology  which  in the end  willfoster international economic relations in terms ofgenerating a freer cash flow  a better investmentenvironment and an increase in joint ventures.Kuwait believes in the need to harness human energiesto narrow the gaps that exist among nations  based on acommon understanding of the tenets that underpin worldsecurity and economic well-being. We also believe thatdialogue and the tolerant exchange of views  coupled withsincere and determined joint action  will lay a solidfoundation for improved international relations. Under thisscenario  the good forces will combine to neutralize the evilones; the “haves” and the “have-nots” might stand a betterchance of interacting beneficially; reason and prudence willreign supreme  while the outlaws  saboteurs and vicioustyrants will continue to lose ground. In the end  livingconditions will improve under a new world order based onthe principles of justice  which promote peace and securityfor all."
"93",3927,"LAO",51,1996,"﻿At the outset  I wish toexpress my pleasure at seeing you  Sir  assume thepresidency of the fifty-first session of the GeneralAssembly. Your election to this very responsible postattests to the important role of your country  Malaysia  acountry with which the Lao People’s DemocraticRepublic has excellent relations of friendship andcooperation in many areas. Aware of your outstanding4competence and your qualities as an experienced diplomat I am convinced that this session’s proceedings will becrowned with brilliant success.I also wish on this occasion to express my sincereappreciation to Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali for the outstanding work he has accomplished during hisfive years in office in the service of the nations and peoplesof the world.The strengthening of cooperation for developmentamong peoples that we have seen in recent years reflectsthe general trend throughout the world. In various regions however  we must sadly note the persistence of complexsituations and tensions arising from bloody ethnic conflictsand religious differences.Even more serious  we are witnessing interference inthe internal affairs of States. Hegemonic policies aretargeted against small States through arbitrary economicblockades  which constitute new forms of racism andslavery. This threatens and could destroy harmoniouscoexistence among States and peoples. The entireinternational community must work even harder to findways and means to solve these problems as soon aspossible. This is no easy task. We must all be patient andresolute. If we work together  keeping equity and justice inour sights as we have done many times  we believe that wecan reach our ultimate goals.In Europe  the Dayton Peace Agreement signed on 14December 1995 to address the problems of Bosnia andHerzegovina  and the recent ensuing elections  marked animportant stage in the search for a solution to thedistressing and destructive conflict in that country. Weappeal to all parties concerned to show maximum restraintand objectivity in their sincere and rigorous implementationof the commitments made  in order to restore peace stability and cooperation in that region.In South Africa  under the resolute guidance ofPresident Mandela  the South African people are trying toovercome the aftermath of apartheid and rebuild thebeloved country. We pay tribute to the new South Africanauthorities for their determination and courage  and hopethat South Africa and its courageous people will enjoyevery success in these difficult undertakings.In the countries of the Caribbean  economiccooperation and cultural and other relations have continuedto develop in accordance with the current internationalclimate  thereby enhancing peace and security in that partof the world. Given this logical course of events  we hopethat the United States of America will adopt a morereasonable position in its efforts to solve the ongoingproblem with the Republic of Cuba through sinceredialogue in order to respond to the legitimate interests ofthe two peoples and help promote understanding betweenthe two countries.In the Middle East  following the establishment ofthe Palestinian Authority in accordance with theWashington peace accord signed in 1993  the peaceprocess was a source of great hope. But recently it hasrun into difficulties. Events last week in Jerusalem furthercompound the situation. We are deeply concerned at thesituation and the Government of Laos hopes that thecoming meeting between leaders of the parties to theIsraeli-Palestinian conflict will help normalize thesituation so that the commitments they made can berespected in the interest of peace and cooperation in theregion and throughout the world.On the Korean peninsula  the Democratic People’sRepublic of Korea and the United States are rightlycontinuing to implement agreements reached  therebyhelping consolidate peace in the region. We welcome thissituation  and the Government and the people of Laosexpress their full support for the deep-seated aspirationsof the Korean people for a situation in which a new warbecomes impossible and the peaceful reunification ofKorea can take place on the basis of dialogue and new suitable mechanisms that can turn aims into reality.In South-East Asia  a movement towards peace andcooperation has gathered strength. Recently  in Malaysia representatives of the countries of the region discussed aplanned railroad from Asia to Europe  from Singaporetowards China via Laos. This project would enhancecooperation in the region. With this in mind  the countriesof the region are trying to work together to solve theirproblems by peaceful means in accordance with regionalrealities. By remaining true to their policies of peacefulcoexistence and security in the interests of development these countries  including the Lao People’s DemocraticRepublic  have signed a treaty on the establishment of anuclear-weapon-free-zone in South-East Asia. Thishistoric event is their major contribution. The Governmentof the Lao People’s Democratic Republic believes that theadoption of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treatyby the fiftieth session of the General Assembly is a signof the immeasurable success of efforts made by theinternational community to bring about the gradualelimination of nuclear weapons throughout the world.5In the Lao People’s Democratic Republic  theeconomic reform that began in 1986 has borne its firstfruits for our people. Average annual economic growth overthe past five years  from 1991 to 1995  stands atapproximately 6.4 per cent. The inflation rate is generallystable  thereby helping gradually to raise the livingstandards of the multi-ethnic Lao populations. What wehave accomplished has helped maintain political stabilityand social harmony. This was why  during its congress lastMarch  the Lao People’s Revolutionary Party gave anexhaustive account of socio-economic development anddecided to continue reform unremittingly on the basis of amarket economy. It also decided to aim for average annualnational economic growth of 8 to 8.5 per cent and a percapita income of $500 per year by the year 2000. Currently our Government is encouraging the various economicsectors to develop and is helping foreigners invest in thepotential of the country with a view to laying downmaterial and technical foundations that can help the countrysay goodbye to underdevelopment by the year 2020. Thisis a major and arduous task which the Government willwork hard to fulfil.In its foreign relations  the Government of the LaoPeople’s Democratic Republic intends to continue its policyof peace  independence  friendship and cooperation with allcountries and international and non-governmentalorganizations. For now  it will focus its efforts on preparingthe conditions necessary for us to be able to join theAssociation of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) in 1997.This will enable the country to develop along the generallines of other countries in the region and throughout theworld. We are pleased that Cambodia and Myanmar haveindicated that they too wish to join ASEAN.Positive developments are taking place in theinternational economic situation. Some countries areshowing signs of progress. However  there have been noindications that the world economy will make a speedy andlasting recovery. Increased interdependence andglobalization in the international economy have bothprovided new opportunities and caused new tensions andimbalances  and have  in particular  increased themarginalization of developing countries. The entireinternational community must act together to ensure thatthere will be a more favourable and more equitableinternational economic environment in which developingcountries can effectively wage their struggle against povertyin order to achieve progress throughout their societies.The right to decent housing for all is essential inguaranteeing stability and sound development in the socio-economic sphere. We are therefore pleased to note theaccomplishments of the United Nations Conference onHuman Settlements  held in June at Istanbul. The LaoPeople’s Democratic Republic is also pleased to note thepositive results achieved at the ninth United NationsConference on Trade and Development  which took placelast May in Midrand  South Africa.Recently  the World Congress against CommercialSexual Exploitation of Children  held in Stockholm Sweden  seriously considered the troubling situation inwhich every year  more than a million children throughoutthe world are victims of abusers of all sorts  andpresented various measures to the internationalcommunity to combat this new danger which threatens thefuture of the new generation. The Lao Governmentsupports these efforts and is determined to implementthem in every manner possible.The problem of drug abuse continues to weighheavily on the international community. Because of itsglobalization  this problem can be solved only througheffective international cooperation founded on theprinciple of shared responsibility. In recent years  theGovernment of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic hasformulated a comprehensive programme for drug controlthrough the year 2000  which consists in a gradualreduction in poppy cultivation through the implementationof integrated rural development projects. Given theseriousness of drugs in our society  we have recentlyamended our penal code and laid down more severesentences for such offenses. We have achieved a certainnumber of satisfying results in implementing thisprogramme  although a great deal remains to be done.With the cooperation and assistance of friendly countriesand international and non-governmental organizations  wehope to be able to make even greater progress in thefuture  which will contribute to the internationalcommunity’s effort to eradicate this scourge from the faceof the Earth.The environment is one of the issues to which theinternational community attaches great importance.Developed and developing countries alike have asovereign  sacred right to exploit their natural resources.In exercising this fundamental right  sustained  economicgrowth must go hand in hand with environmentprotection  and vice versa. Environmental protectionshould in no way imply a rejection of economicdevelopment out of fear of damaging the environment. Asthe two pillars of lasting development in all countries these concepts must be mutually reinforcing. It would be6unwise  in our view  to emphasize one at the expense of theother. Only equal regard for these two aspects willguarantee the success of any development effort.We live in a complex and still uncertain world. In thiscontext  nations and peoples throughout the world accordgreat importance to the United Nations  the only universalmultilateral forum for the consideration of world problems.In order to ensure that it can discharge its great duties  theinstitution needs to adapt itself to new world realities. Inthis vein  it is essential to affirm the role of the GeneralAssembly  where all States are represented  as the UnitedNations system’s principal organ for deliberation anddecision-making. As for the Security Council  the Laodelegation believes that it should be restructured and mademore democratic  and that there should be a limitedexpansion in the number of its permanent and non-permanent members according to equitable geographicdistribution and taking into account the relative importanceof the various countries. In an effort to achieve this goal certain countries  such as Japan  Germany and India inparticular  should become permanent members of theSecurity Council. The Security Council would thus be in aposition to meet the legitimate aspirations of MemberStates  and particularly of the developing countries  whichconstitute the vast majority of nations on our planet. In thisvein  the Lao People’s Democratic Republic  in cooperationwith other delegations  will spare no effort to positivelycontribute to the current efforts to strengthen our universalOrganization."
"94",3970,"LBN",51,1996,"﻿ Atthe outset  allow me to congratulate Ambassador Razali onhis election as President of this session of the GeneralAssembly and to wish him success in his noble task ofenhancing and strengthening the role of the United Nations.I would also like to express our thanks and appreciation tothe former President of the General Assembly Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral  for his efforts during hispresidency.Half a century has elapsed since the birth of theUnited Nations. Mankind wanted the United Nations to bea bastion of justice  peace and human rights. It is meant tobe an authority where problems are solved and truth upheld where mankind can find an organization to defend its rightswhen they are usurped and stand by its side when it isthreatened. In founding the United Nations  mankindwanted to put an end to wars and usher in an era of peace of respect for the principle of State sovereignty and ofsafeguarding peoples’ independence and their right to self-determination and to the fulfilment of their aspirations.With the telecommunications revolution and the fall ofpolitical  economic  demographic  cultural and securityboundaries and barriers  States and their peoples need aneffective machinery for consultation and constructivedialogue. The scientific and technological revolution hasincreased our need for a greater synergy to face thecomplex problems of our time and to bridge the gapbetween the countries and nations of the world so as toenable them to implement jointly subregional andinterregional projects that none can do alone.The world population explosion and the concomitantecological degradation have made the environmentincapable of meeting rising demand. Competition fornatural resources and for the protection of vital interestshave risen sharply.The increased number and growing sophistication oflethal nuclear  chemical and bacteriological weapons ofmass destruction and the further development of theirintercontinental delivery systems heightens the threat ofannihilation for many countries and peoples  especiallywhen some of the countries which possess them lack evenminimal credibility.Some societies are overwhelmed by the degree ofsophistication of the media  by its role and by the speedwith which political  economic  social  cultural andscientific news flows through it. These societies may notbe ready to assimilate and absorb this flow ofinformation  so they react by isolating themselves  bywithdrawing into seclusion  or by hiding behind the veilof tradition to protect their identity. This manifests itselfin the extremism and fundamentalism these societies useto shield themselves from what is often perceived as athreat to their identity.These and other problems and challenges requireinvigorating the United Nations machinery and renewingconfidence in its credibility  justice and efficiency  to freeits decisions from hegemony  eliminate its imbalances andbring consistency to the standards it uses for theimplementation of its resolutions. We must do this if wewant the United Nations to remain a valuable globalauthority and the alternative to destructive and violentconfrontation.The world has witnessed a succession of local andregional crises. Lebanon  which has suffered immensely plagued by the wars of others on its soil  follows withconcern the developments in different parts of the world.The crisis over the sovereignty of the United ArabEmirates on the Greater Tunb  Lesser Tunb and AbuMusa islands has not yet been settled. We hope referringthe case to the International Court of Justice will result ina settlement reaffirming the United Arab Emirates claimof sovereignty.We also support arbitration of the case of theGreater and Lesser Hanish islands between Yemen andEritrea; both parties have agreed to such arbitration.Support for the unity  security and stability ofLiberia and Angola remains a primary objective to put anend to the suffering of their peoples.Lebanon likewise supports the Republic of Cyprusin its efforts to build unity and sovereignty over all itsterritory to put an end to the suffering of its people andto the effects of the problem on the Government ofCyprus with respect to the reunification of the island.Lebanon has been following with grave concern therecent deterioration of the situation in Iraq and thesuffering of the Iraqi people  who still lack food and otherbasic needs. We do not believe that the recent events16represent the best way to address the Iraqi problem. We callrather for the implementation of Security Councilresolution 986 (1995)  and for a commitment to the unityand sovereignty of Iraq  which would guarantee theinviolability of the geopolitical map of the Middle East. Ifa breach were to be opened in Iraq  the consequenceswould definitely extend to other extremely sensitiveregions  which would further complicate the situation. Oursupport of the sovereignty of the State of Kuwait over allits territory prompts us to appeal for a permanent guaranteeof its sovereignty and security so that we can turn the pageon this bitter chapter of history once and for all.The credibility enjoyed by international law is basedon its ability to find just and complete solutions toimportant questions. This is the mission of the UnitedNations and it therefore should be spared from having tointervene in less important crises.The credibility of the United Nations is still called intoquestion and this  in turn  undermines the role of theOrganization in the field of the non-proliferation of nuclearweapons. The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of NuclearWeapons (NPT) has been extended despite the reservationsexpressed by some States  including Lebanon  on thecircumstances of its extension  including Israel’s refusal tobecome a party to it. Israel is allowed to maintain aformidable nuclear arsenal in one of the most sensitive andvolatile regions of the world without any safeguards orcontrols; this poses a threat to all the peoples of the region.The cessation of nuclear testing has been presented as analternative to the NPT. Despite the many promises madeprior to the extension of the NPT that Israel wouldultimately accede to it  this has yet to happen. Using doublestandards in dealing with States can only create imbalances which in turn increases the number of exceptions to therule. The effectiveness of the Organization depends on theequal treatment of all States  and the United Nationsremains the means to implement such policies.In this context  Lebanon enthusiastically supportsenhancing the functioning and management of theOrganization in all areas  particularly with regard to thescope of representation of the world’s peoples and thecountries in the Security Council. Recent changes and newrequirements demand more realistic geographic andnumerical representation in that body. We need to eliminatethe perception of hegemony that some have developedabout the role and decision-making power of the Council which they seem to believe has been seized by certainmajor Powers. Lebanon believes that all proposals in thisregard must be carefully studied  particularly those that arecompatible with the approach I have outlined and thatenjoy broad support among States. I am thinking inparticular of the proposals of the non-aligned countriesand of Italy.In recent years  and despite the many difficultcircumstances that have accompanied his years in office the Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  hasmade commendable efforts to further global peace security and stability. He has worked to solve problemsof social and economic development as well as those ofhealth in many parts of the world. Furthermore  he hasundertaken numerous reforms within the Organization.His term has been distinguished by dynamism towards theachievement of the Organization’s primary goals. Despitethe obstacles  his accomplishments are many and theworld bears witness to them. This continued course  asseen in a renewed mandate  would be a basic guaranteeof the stability of United Nations policies. Lebanonbelieves that the renewal of the Secretary-General’smandate would make it possible to complete manyprojects and measures undertaken during his first term.We therefore call upon States to support his bid for arenewed  strengthened mandate.We would have very much liked our participation inthis session  several years following the Madridconference  to be an occasion for gratitude for therestoration of peace in the Middle East. We had hoped toexpress our gratitude to the countries  peoples andorganizations which have tried to bring about this peace.Five years have passed since the Madrid peaceconference  not counting the preparatory year. At thetime  we welcomed the initiative and believed in thesponsorship and the subject matter of the conference. Thesponsors were two influential Powers  and the substancewas geared towards the achievement of a comprehensive just and lasting peace on the basis of the implementationof Security Council resolutions 242 (1967)  338 (1973) and with regard to Lebanon  Security Council resolution425 (1978)  as well as the principle of land for peace. Weaccepted the invitation and thought that the others whoaccepted it had also agreed to its substance  and that theonly pending issues would be implementation  schedulingand mechanisms.But years have passed  and instead of movingforward towards implementation  Israel has reneged on itscommitments and has tried to move away from what wasalready done. As soon as the new Israeli Government wasin power  it adopted its manifesto: “The four No’s” — noto the withdrawal from the occupied Syrian Golan; no to17the withdrawal from the occupied West Bank; no to thesettlement of the question of Jerusalem; and no torecognition of the national rights of the Palestinian peoplein a State of their own.To the contrary  the principle of land for peace hasbeen replaced by the principle of peace for security meaning refraining from waging a new war. Instead offulfilling commitments  formulas must be changed. Insteadof Madrid  there is the unknown. Instead of putting an endto settlements  settlements are being expanded. A tunnel isnow being built under the Al-Aqsa Mosque  in a clear actof provocation to the people’s sensitivities.We were asked to shake hands  to offer recognitionand to normalize relations without knowing what willhappen to our rights. We  the victims of aggression  areasked to give security guarantees to the aggressor. Thosewho do not possess weapons are asked to give assurancesto those who have one of the largest nuclear arsenals in theworld and who could not be convinced to accede to theNPT when other countries have been forced to accept itsindefinite extension.Since the new Israeli Government came to power  ithas backed away from the peace process  althoughoccasional misleading steps are made. The new Governmentof Israel has resorted to a meaningless media campaign todisguise its rejection of peace. We first heard the “Lebanonfirst” slogan  but this too was void of any meaning exceptas an attempt at isolation and to serve the purposes of themedia campaign. We then heard of the meeting between thePalestinian and Israeli presidents. Once again  the occasionwas exploited  but meaning remained absent.It has become clear that the objective of the IsraeliGovernment was to numb world public opinion and undowhat was agreed upon at the peace conference and theensuing negotiations. It is perfectly clear that Israel doesnot have a policy for peace. It only has a policy ofchanging formulas  a policy of threats and challenges  apolicy that Israel can use to further its expansionist andsettlement schemes.Just as the world was on the verge of believing thatpeace had become possible in the Middle East region  herewe are facing the unknown  facing the worst.Some States in the region wanted to precipitate theearlier optimism by moving to normalize relations. Nowthey bear the burden of Israeli logic. Now the peoples ofthe region have been thrust back into an era of inevitableconfrontation  violence  and resistance. No sooner had thedevelopment plans of the Middle East region been putinto place and the world was showing interest in a futureof peace than mistrust and pessimism returned to prevail.No sooner had the historic opportunity for the realizationof a great dream begun to crystallize than this opportunitystarted to fade  leaving the peoples of the region withonly one alternative — to confront occupation  arbitraryrule and obstinacy — since all international peace effortsare failing. Today’s violence in Palestine and in southernLebanon is a direct result of the negative positions of theIsraeli Government. It presages dire consequences shouldthe peace process collapse.Since the Madrid Conference  the United States hastried  through two successive presidencies  to push thepeace process forward towards settlement. In order to doso  the United States requested that the peace process betaken out of the context of the United Nations and theSecurity Council and be confined to the mechanismsdefined at Madrid. The United States sought to reassureIsrael by all military  material and economic meansavailable  even to the detriment of the Arabs  with theidea of reviving the confidence of the Israelis. Then theUnited States imposed concepts to increase guaranteesgiven to Israel to consolidate the peace process  whichwere provisionally accepted  despite the fact that theywere unsound. Today  these efforts are threatened by theparty that benefited from them in the first place.Today  the President of the United States will try tobring together the parties concerned  pursuing hisresponsibility to salvage the peace. Israel will continueto manoeuvre  and will exploit the occasion provided byUnited States presidential elections to undermine the stepsthat were already in place. They will foil the efforts ofthe United States  which we supported even though thesecalled for a continued and somewhat iniquitous toleranceof Israel  despite the fact that Israel’s excesses had alwaysbeen covered by assurances for the sake of peace.We must return to the foundations of peace asannounced at Madrid  resume the negotiations from wherethey were interrupted and realize that the opportunity forpeace which had started to crystallize still presents ahistoric opportunity. It must be recognized that what wasachieved at Madrid is the only foundation acceptable tothe people of the region. If peace is ever to be salvagedin the Middle East  this is the only way to achieve it.Lebanon has for many years suffered the aftermathand consequences of the Middle East crisis and has paid18a heavy toll. Today  through domestic political measures security  development and economic achievements  Lebanonis once again proving that it can confront difficulties andface challenges. Lebanon is showing that its national unity the restoration of full sovereignty over its territory andrespect for its independence are inevitably more solidlyinherent in its existence than some might believe.In the future  if peace is safeguarded  Lebanon willprove that its history is larger than its geographical bordersand that its role by far exceeds its size. When Lebanonregains its sovereignty over all of its territories now underIsraeli occupation  when the United Nations has restored itscredibility by implementing Security Councilresolution 425 (1978) on an equal footing with resolutionsrelating to other parts of the world  when Lebanese citizensare released from Israeli detention camps where they areimprisoned with only minimal human rights  then and onlythen will the bleeding stop and the wound heal.The Middle East is tired of being an active volcanothreatening world peace. We have for too long been robbedof peace to the detriment of the entire world. Opportunitieswill not forever remain for those seeking peace. The peacewhich we sought and for which we have long appealed isthreatened today. The failure of our endeavours to achievepeace will close the door to any new attempt in theforeseeable future. If reviving peace is a difficult job  theramifications of failure will be even more difficult for thewhole world.The days when problems were confined to nationalboundaries are well over  and so are the days whenboundaries were walls keeping crises contained. We hopethat peace is still possible. But it must be a just peace  nota despoiling one; a real peace  not a theatrical one; anequitable peace not an iniquitous one. It must be a peacethat calms rather than one that fans the anger of peoples.May God forever guide the steps of those who seekand work for peace  and inspire those who still oppose it."
"95",4017,"LBR",51,1996,"﻿Permit me to express on behalf of mycountry  Liberia  our sincere congratulations to you  Sir  onyour unanimous election as President of the GeneralAssembly. It is our expectation that your tenure will bemarked by the same distinction that has characterized yourservice to your country  Malaysia.I express our sincere appreciation to your predecessor His Excellency Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral of Portugal for efficiently conducting the proceedings of the historicfiftieth session of the General Assembly.I also wish to congratulate the Secretary-General Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for his continuing dedication tothe cause of world peace and social justice  which hasprovided the United Nations an opportunity to enhance thedignity of all mankind in spite of the odds that continue tofrustrate our common aspirations and our efforts to build abetter world.Liberia bears its share of responsibility for findingsolutions to the problems of our one world through thisOrganization. Regrettably  the situation in Liberia has notafforded us the opportunity to participate as actively asmight be expected.It is an honour and privilege for me to stand beforethis world body as Africa’s first female Head ofGovernment. However  it is sad to note that I have assumedthis leadership at a time when my country  Liberia  isexperiencing a tragic and senseless war.The Liberian civil war  which began more than sixyears ago  has unleashed one of the worst man-madedisasters in recent memory. It has claimed over 250 000lives — about 15 per cent of the population; forced over800 000 Liberians to seek refuge in neighbouring countries;and left several hundred thousand others internallydisplaced.Regrettably  the most vulnerable groups — women children and the elderly — continue to be victimized by theravages of disease  hunger and malnutrition  which arecommonplace under such conditions. The wanton killingof civilians and the destruction of basic infrastructure which intensified in April of this year  continue to retardeconomic activities and deprive the people of theirfundamental human rights.The painful reality of our child soldiers  childlabourers and abandoned children in the country point tothe formidable task that lies ahead as we seek torehabilitate them into productive citizens.The displacement of large segments of the ruralpopulation has curtailed agricultural production. Beforethe war  agriculture accounted for 38 per cent of the grossdomestic product and 75 per cent of total employment. Asa result of continued hostilities  other potentially higheconomic sectors such as rubber  timber  iron ore andminerals remain inaccessible.Since 1990  the Economic Community of WestAfrican States (ECOWAS) has deployed a peacekeepingforce in Liberia  in keeping with Chapter VIII of theCharter of the United Nations. It had been hoped that thisinitiative  the first by a subregion  would receive the fullsupport of the United Nations. Unfortunately  theassistance of the international community has been bothslow and inadequate  thereby imposing severe pressure onthe scarce resources of the member States of ECOWAS.While ECOWAS  in the spirit of Africanbrotherhood and solidarity  has taken the initiative inLiberia  its efforts must be complemented by theinternational community through the provision ofsubstantial material and financial support to facilitate theimplementation of the peace process in the country. It istherefore my appeal that the United Nations assume itsshare of the burden of peacekeeping in Liberia. Thesubregion is facing extreme economic hardships due toexternal factors beyond its control.After the failure of several peace agreements  themember States of ECOWAS convened a meeting inAbuja  the Federal Republic of Nigeria  in August 1995.At that meeting  a decision was taken to include for thefirst time the leaders of the three major warring factionsin a six-man Council of State. Accordingly  a ceasefirewas implemented  and Monrovia was maintained as a safehaven. The members of the Council of State wereinducted into office on 1 September 1995.7In April of this year  the resumption of fighting  withthe accompanying carnage and illegal seizure anddestruction of property  dealt another set-back to the peaceprocess. At this juncture  I extend the profound regrets ofthe Liberian Government and people to the international intergovernmental  non-governmental and otherorganizations that sustained losses as a result of the Aprilfighting. I pledge that our Administration will do all thatlies within its power to prevent the reoccurrence of suchlawlessness.The events of April enabled the leaders of thesubregion to identify deficiencies in the Agreement and totake measures to prevent the reoccurrence of suchbreakdown in the implementation of the peace accord.Although they reaffirmed the Abuja Agreement as the bestframework for finding a lasting solution to the Liberianconflict  they nevertheless resolved that a change wasnecessary in the leadership to restore confidence andenhance its performance.The parties unanimously selected me to lead Liberiafrom a devastating war to conditions of peace. Theselection of a woman is a decision that deservescommendation; for it is a major victory and a recognitionof the active involvement of Liberian women in the peaceprocess. The resolution of the Liberian conflict is thereforea challenge not only to me but also to all Liberian womenand to the women of Africa and the world  whose adviceand continuing support I deeply appreciate.Our leadership is challenged with the difficult task ofpursuing national reconciliation  national reunification repatriation and resettlement of refugees and internallydisplaced persons  and the creation of an enablingenvironment for the holding of free and fair democraticelections by May 1997. Additionally  and more demanding we must ensure the successful disarmament of combatantsand their demobilization and reintegration into civil society.This task requires us  as a matter of urgency  to firstdisarm our children and redirect their lives. We also haveto address the immense suffering that the war has inflictedon our people. We must establish an independent electionscommission to conduct free and fair elections underinternational supervision.I am confident that  with the support of the UnitedNations and the international community  the tasks aheadwill be achieved. All of the parties to the conflict havepledged to me their commitment to the implementation ofthe revised schedule. Despite some signs of retrogression our timely intervention and appeals have been heeded thus averting the derailment of the process. We are awarethat our efforts to maintain the ceasefire must besustained at every stage of the peace process by timelyintervention and insistence that the terms and conditionsof the peace agreement must be respected by the parties.There is a renewed hope for peace in Liberia as aresult of the decisions taken at the last Abuja summit.The failure over the past six years to achieve peace in thecountry made it imperative that long overdue measures betaken to ensure the final and successful implementation ofthe Abuja Agreement.First  due care and consideration was given to theselection of the Head of Government  with the view ofensuring effective leadership and a sense of purpose.Secondly  provision was made for the regular monitoringand assessment of the implementation of the peaceAgreement. This responsibility was assigned to the specialrepresentative of the Chairman of ECOWAS and theECOWAS Committee of Nine on Liberia. Thirdly ECOWAS member States agreed to impose sanctions onany person or group of persons obstructing theimplementation of the peace Agreement. These necessarymeasures will equally require the support of theinternational community.The Government and people of Liberia share theconviction of the member States of ECOWAS  as well asthe international community  that the Abuja peaceAgreement provides the best framework for the resolutionof the Liberian conflict. As Chairman of the Council ofState  I reaffirm my total commitment to the fullimplementation of the ECOWAS peace plan for Liberia.We owe a debt of gratitude to the Government and peopleof the Federal Republic of Nigeria  as well as to othermember States of ECOWAS  for their untiring efforts andsacrifices in the quest for peace in Liberia.We also extend our gratitude to the Governments ofthe United States of America  the Netherlands andGermany for their recent assistance to the ECOWASMonitoring Group (ECOMOG). We thank other friendlynations that have made  and continue to make contributions to the resolution of the Liberian conflict.The Liberian Government appeals for assistance to enablethe deployment of additional troops to sustain the newfocus on disarmament and demobilization as well asensure thereafter the rehabilitation and reconstruction ofour war-torn country.8In order to facilitate the rehabilitation of thesechildren  we appeal to friendly Governments to help usrebuild our educational institutions  especially thoseproviding vocational and technical training. As a caringmother  I urgently need to rehabilitate and grant relief tothese children. It is one of my principal concerns. In thisregard  I express appreciation to the United NationsChildren’s Fund (UNICEF) and the United NationsDevelopment Programme (UNDP) for their assistance. It ismy hope that all mothers and all humanitarian governmental and non-governmental organizations willsupport this worthy undertaking. The Liberian children indeed the children of our world  are our future.As regards the international situation  while we willcontinue to accord priority to the civil war in Liberia untilgenuine peace is restored  we have not lost sight of otherimportant issues that are of vital concern to the internationalcommunity.It is encouraging to note that since the end of the coldwar  Member States have increasingly taken measures insupport of general and complete disarmament  includingnuclear weapons. The establishment of zones of peace inmost regions of the world and the recent adoption of theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty  which myGovernment has already signed  are positive developmentsin the field of disarmament. It is hoped that further progresswill be made in the total elimination of nuclear weaponswithin a given time-frame.Liberia  which is emerging from conditions of war  isconcerned about the unrestricted use of conventionalweapons  including anti-personnel landmines. Theinternational community must also focus its attention onconventional disarmament  since these deadly weapons areusually resorted to in most conflicts.Internal strife in several countries resulting fromethnic  religious and racial differences continues to causedeath and destruction in Angola  Burundi  Rwanda Somalia  the former Yugoslavia  Afghanistan and my owncountry. In order to spare the lives of innocent civilians  weappeal to all parties to enter into dialogue and seek apolitical settlement of their differences.As we move towards the twenty-first century  we areencouraged by the growing concern about the persistentlyslow and unbalanced growth of the world economy. Wehave experienced the direct impact of the unevendistribution of resources both among and within nations.The crisis in Liberia today is an expression of thisunevenness  which has a direct relationship to poverty andinstability.It is worth mentioning that in every attempt atfinding a solution  such issues as the debt crisis and thedecline in official development assistance continue tohamper our efforts to bring about the required reform infavour of the development of our people. This situationcontinues to undermine development in many regions ofthe world  especially Africa. Today  Africa remains theonly continent where the level of poverty is causingincreasing hardship and despair  despite the courageousefforts by many countries to undertake reforms.Regrettably  programmes proposed by theinternational community have yet to receive adequatedonor assistance to move Africa’s development forward.We recall the priority programme for Africa’s economicrecovery and other measures to address the criticalsituation facing the continent.It is in this light that I commend the United NationsSystem-wide Special Initiative for Africa launched earlierthis year. The initiative requires commitments amountingto $25 billion over a period of 10 years  to be realizedthrough the reallocation of existing resources  andcomplements the United Nations New Agenda for theDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s.We therefore plead with the United Nations and itsagencies  international financial institutions and bilateraldonors to re-examine their attitudes towards Africa’sdevelopment aspirations. We hope that a solution will befound to the extreme burden that debt now imposes on allcountries  but especially on those coming out of crisis.In spite of the difficulties facing Liberia  it hascontinued to consider the role of women as crucial to thedevelopment process by advocating an improved statusfor women. Liberia has supported the decisions emanatingfrom conferences on the advancement of women particularly the Beijing Conference held in 1995. Mypresence here today as Chairman of the Council of Stateis a testimony to Liberia’s support for its women and forthe rights of women everywhere.I take this opportunity to say that it would beadvantageous to all Member States of this Organization ifwe  as world leaders  committed ourselves to a policy ofmutual respect for one another and for our respectivepeoples and their legitimate aspirations in life. I amconvinced that prospects for a peaceful world will be9made greater if we summon the courage to equitably sharewithout restraints the material and technological resourcesthat represent our common inheritance on earth.Once those considerations become our cherishedpreoccupation and the noble focus of our collectiveundertakings  the world will enjoy a better future: a futurethat will know no bounds for the collective happiness ofmankind; a future that will be devoid of terrorism and war;and a future that will not occasion famine  starvation andhuman degradation; a future without jealousy  hatred orenvy.We can make tomorrow better or worse. The questionis: which will it be? The United Nations system and theentire international community will be judged on the basisof their response to this important question."
"96",4063,"LBY",51,1996,"﻿It gives me great pleasure tocongratulate Mr. Razali Ismail on his election as Presidentof this session of the General Assembly. His assumptionof that high post is a tribute to him personally and to hiscountry  Malaysia  with which my country has goodrelations and close ties enhanced by bonds of friendshipand cooperation. My delegation is confident that hispolitical experience and diplomatic skill will help us inachieving a successful session. He has taken over thepresidency from his predecessor  His ExcellencyMr. Diego Freitas do Amaral of Portugal. I should like totake this opportunity to express our gratitude to him forthe way he conducted the affairs of the fiftieth session ofthe General Assembly.Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali has shown great skill inconducting the affairs of the Organization by virtue of hislong experience  his wide knowledge of world affairs andhis grasp of the substance of regional conflicts. That iswhy he enjoys our full support in continuing at the helmof the Organization. Since he enjoys worldwide support as expressed by several regional organizations  we areconfident that the Assembly will support his reelection tothe post of Secretary-General of the Organization so that19he may continue the process he started in the field ofrestructuring and strengthening the United Nations andenhancing its role to enable it fully to shoulder itsresponsibilities in realizing the purposes of the Charter namely  the establishment of peace  justice and equality andthe promotion of development.This session is convened in the aftermath of importantevents and in the midst of vast developments. The FourthWorld Conference on Women achieved good results.Attempts are being made to overcome economic difficulties promote development  and eliminate phenomena thatthreaten the environment.It is a good omen that this session is starting at a timewhen optimism is rising as a result of the progress achievedin settling the dispute in the Balkans. But if satisfaction atsuch happy developments has been widespread  concern hasdeepened over the persistence of chronic disturbances andthe eruption of destructive civil wars. To confront theseevents  which threaten international peace and security  theinternational community must exert greater effort to containsuch disturbances and wars.In this context  it is essential to remove the obstacleshampering the implementation of peace agreements inAngola and Liberia. A definitive solution must beimplemented for the ethnic disputes in Rwanda andBurundi. The brotherly people of Somalia continue to sufferfrom long-standing problems. They expect our support fora reconciliation that would meet the needs of all Somalisand respond to their hopes and aspirations. An end shouldbe put to the suffering of the brotherly people of Iraq bylifting the sanctions  maintaining the unity and territorialintegrity of Iraq and desisting from premeditated attemptsto impinge on its sovereignty and its freedom in decision-making.My country is extremely concerned at the latestdevelopments in Iraq. The United States aggression againstIraq is a violation of its sovereignty and an interference inits internal affairs. We have confirmed and confirm againtoday that Iraq has the right to territorial integrity and toexercise sovereignty over its entire territory. For the UnitedStates of America to consider that Iraq’s exercise of itssovereign rights constitutes aggression  at a time when Iraqis being subjected to United States aggression  is reverselogic that must be denounced and condemned by theinternational community.The conflict in the Middle East  with the question ofPalestine at its core  has been among the priority issues atthe United Nations for more than half a century. Now despite all the talk about the peace process  the factremains that the Palestinian people continue to bedisplaced from their homeland. Those who remain areoppressed by the Israelis by collective siege and randomdeportation  in total disregard of internationaldenunciation of such practices and in complete defianceof the international will  which supports the legitimatestruggle of the Palestinian people and calls for respect forinternational decisions calling for the full realization of allthe rights of the Palestinian people  in particular theirright to return to their homeland and their right to self-determination.As we have seen ever since the usurpation of theland of Palestine by the Israelis  the fact is thatoccupation and expansion have always been a constantpolicy to realize israeli ambitions. Their settlementactivities increase daily. Their jails are filled withthousands of prisoners. Houses are demolished for noreason. Rash Israeli statements that the Palestinians haveno right to a State of their own are often repeated  alongwith acts of aggression against southern Lebanon. TheIsraelis are also perpetuating their occupation of theSyrian Golan. They persevere in the judaization ofJerusalem  including their designs to demolish the mostimportant Islamic shrine  namely  the Holy Al-AqsaMosque.These Israeli actions prove that the Israelis do notwant peace. Their joining the so-called peace process isnothing more than a smoke screen to hide their attemptsto impose their will on the Arab nation and make it bowin submission  thus setting a seal on their occupation andtheir sense of superiority.My country has publicly declared that the currentso-called peace arrangements will not lead to a genuineand lasting solution. Events have proved the validity ofour analysis and the depth of our vision. Just  true andcomprehensive peace will not be achieved so long as theIsraelis are shedding the blood of the Palestinian people.Peace will not be sustainable under the shadow of Israel’snuclear terrorism and its obstinate denial of the legitimaterights of the Palestinian people. Peace can come onlythrough the return of the Palestinians to their homelandand the establishment of an independent  democratic Statein Palestine  with Holy Jerusalem as its capital and wherePalestinian Arabs and Jews would live on an equalfooting — similar to what has happened in South Africa.Anything other than that solution would ignore historicalfacts and lack realism  and would only lead to more20bloodshed and keep the area as a pocket of tension wherenobody enjoys peace or security.Five years ago  three western countries — the UnitedStates of America  Britain and France — accused Libyancitizens of involvement in the Pan American flight 103accident and the incident involving the French union detranports aérens (UTA) flight 772. Despite the fact thatthose who unleashed those accusations never submitted anyproof or evidence to support their claims  my country hasdeclared its readiness to uncover all the facts related to thetwo incidents. We started an investigation of those whomthe American and the British authorities claim are involvedin the Pan American flight 103 incident.My country has also called on the authorities in thesecountries to assist with the investigation. Instead ofresponding to this request  which falls within the legalframework of the dispute  the three countries have fullypoliticized the problem  resorted to the Security Counciland imposed Council resolution 731 (1992). Despite all this and out of our keen desire to settle all aspects of thedispute  the Jamahiriya announced its acceptance of thatresolution and took practical measures in response to it.The Jamahiriya has condemned international terrorismin all its forms and has declared its commitment to anymeasures to be decided by the international community tocombat terrorism. Libya’s vehement determination to securethe total eradication of terrorism is reflected in the civilizedproposal contained in document A/46/840  which calls forthe convening of a special session of the General Assemblyto study the causes and dimensions of this phenomenon anddevise the means that would eliminate it.The Jamahiriya has also cooperated with theGovernment of the United Kingdom in uncovering theelements accused by Britain of involvement in terrorist acts.In the statement  circulated in document S/1995/973 of 20November 1995  the British informed the Security Councilthat Libya’s answers to their queries about the relationshipwith the provisional Irish Republic Army were satisfactoryand conformed with their expectations.Furthermore  Libya has cooperated with the Frenchinvestigating magistrate who visited Libya during the period5 to 16 July 1996. During that visit  the Libyan authoritiesprovided him with all the facilities he needed to concludehis mission. Later  French statements paid tribute to thepositive cooperation of the Libyan authorities with theFrench magistrate.The Jamahiriya has proposed several solutions forthe trial of the two Libyans suspected of involvement inthe United States plane’s accident. It has proposed thatthe two stand trial before a court whose venue should beagreed upon. Libya has also proposed recourse to theInternational Court of Justice after the United States andBritain refused to apply the Montreal Convention for theSuppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of CivilAviation of 1971  despite the fact that both countries areparties to the Convention. Libya has also accepted theproposal submitted by the League of Arab States  whichcalls for trying the two suspects at the headquarters of theInternational Court of Justice in The Hague  beforeScottish judges and under Scottish law.These proposed solutions which were eithersubmitted or accepted by the Jamahiriya have beenconfirmed on more than one occasion and before severalforums  including this Assembly. This is a sufficientresponse to those who claim that Libya refuses to permitthe trial of the two suspects  and especially to PresidentClinton  who said in his statement on 23 September thatLibya refuses to surrender the persons responsible for theexplosion of Pan American flight 103. Libya has noobjection to the two suspects standing trial. The onlything that Libya wants is to guarantee them a neutral andfair trial  free from any media or political influences. Weask this especially because officials in both Britain andthe United States  in their statements  have claimed thatthe two Libyan citizens are guilty and should be punished indicating that a conviction is pre-ordained before anyinvestigation and before any court appearance.The Jamahiriya’s handling of the dispute has beenwidely supported internationally and by Arab and Africancountries. The Organization of the Islamic Conference hasdeclared its solidarity with our position. The Movementof Non-Aligned Countries supported it at Jakarta andreaffirmed that support at Cartagena. It was also stronglysupported by the Arab Summit at Cairo. The Organizationof African Unity has repeatedly supported it  from the1993 Cairo Summit through the latest Summit atYaoundé.When the three countries were confronted by thesepositions  which confirmed the firm conviction that Libyahas indeed responded to the requirements of SecurityCouncil resolutions  they started to drag other issues farremoved from the dispute and its context. Both Britainand the United States are trying to evade responsibilityfor fabricating the problem. They have been attempting todepict the dispute as one between Libya and the21international community. Is this not a reversal of the facts?How can the dispute be one between Libya and theinternational community  when international support isincreasing daily for the Libyan position? This support isembodied in the support of regional and internationalorganizations  the population of whose members exceedstwo thirds of the world’s population.Those two Governments have now come up with anew lie. They say that Libya is defying internationallegality. The facts totally refute this. Libya is one of thecountries most committed to international law. Proof of thisis its implementation of the verdict of the InternationalCourt of Justice in its territorial dispute with Chad  eventhough this was not in our favour. Furthermore  officials inthose two countries claim that Libya is not a peace-lovingState. This is another lie. The Jamahiriya is a peace-lovingcountry. It believes in peace and practices it. Its role in thepeaceful settlement of disputes between States has beenembodied in its active role in trying to achievereconciliation between Sudan and Uganda. It has also beenreflected in its successful efforts at reconciling thePhilippines and the Moro National Liberation Front.Raising what has become known as the Lockerbiecrisis falls within the context of these false allegations andfabricated accusations. It confirms a fact that we havestated right from the beginning: that this is a premeditated fabricated problem aimed at punishing the Libyan peoplefor certain principles in which they believe and certainpositions they defend. It is as if those who created thiscrisis were not content with the difficulties and pains whichthe Libyan people have already suffered at the hands of thecolonialists and the fascists who  on our territory  fought awar that killed and displaced hundreds of thousands ofLibyans  and planted in their farms and under their homesmillions of land mines which still kill innocent people andimpede Libya’s efforts to protect the environment  combatdesertification  and expand in the fields of economic andsocial development.If the aim behind the fabrication of the crisis was notto punish us for certain principles we uphold and certainpositions we defend  why did the two countries refuse fromthe start to apply the relevant international convention —the Montreal Convention? Why did they drag the SecurityCouncil into this legal problem  which has nothingwhatsoever to do with its functions? Why did they hastento impose sanctions on us only two months after the startof this crisis? How did these countries accord themselvesthe right to participate in the voting on Security Councilresolution 731 (1992)  in contravention of Article 27 (3) ofthe Charter? Why do the British and AmericanGovernments reject any initiative to settle the dispute bydialogue and negotiation? What is the justification fortheir intransigence in rejecting the proposal of the Leagueof Arab States that was accepted by Libya? Why do theseStates insist on accusing our citizens when new facts havebeen uncovered and published in several books andnewspapers refuting their claims and confirming that theincident was planned by professional intelligence servicesto coverup certain suspicious activities? Also  why didthese States push the Security Council to adopt a doublestandard  imposing sanctions on Libya under Chapter VIIof the Charter when it did not threaten anybody or in anyway compromise international peace and security. At thesame time  these countries prevented the Security Councilfrom applying the same Chapter to a major power thatsent hundreds of its war planes to attack our country andbomb our cities while their residents lay sleeping in theirbeds? This same big Power still practises State terrorismagainst us  freezing our financial assets and imposingunilateral sanctions on us  refusing to respond to GeneralAssembly resolution 41/38  which calls on it tocompensate our people for the losses they suffered as aresult of its brutal aggression against us in April 1986.The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya has sought to settle thedispute. All it has asked for is that it be settled inaccordance with the principles of the Charter of theUnited Nations and the rules of international law. Mycountry is satisfied because its handling of this crisis wassupported by most countries of the world. And here Iwould like to pay tribute to the members of the Non-Aligned Movement  the Organization of the IslamicConference  the Organization of African Unity and theLeague of Arab States for their appreciation of ourposition and their understanding of our earnestness inseeking a quick and just solution. In particular  we wouldlike to thank members of the Security Council whoappreciated our response  tried to do us justice and soughtto lift the unjust sanctions imposed on us.The magnitude of the suffering of the Libyan peopleunder the sanctions has been detailed in documentS/1996/717. Suffice it to say that the sanctions have sofar resulted in the deaths of 3 340 persons in roadaccidents. More than 12 000 persons have suffered seriouspermanent injuries because of these accidents. Moreover the sanctions have cost more than $18 billion in materiallosses.There is no excuse for condoning such injustice  andthe continuation of this injustice is wrong. Most countries22of the world have repeated their calls for an acceleratedsolution of the Lockerbie crisis  in accordance withinternational laws and conventions. The Jamahiriya hasaccepted that. The obstacle lies in the blind intransigenceand illogical demands of the American and BritishGovernments. Should the two Governments persist in theiruncompromising positions  refuse to settle the dispute in aspirit of justice and fairness  and relieve the suffering ourpeople have endured for more than four years  the onlything left to the Libyan people would be to appeal to thosein this forum with clean consciences to intensify theirefforts in order to expose the unjust practices exercised bythe United States and Britain to extend the duration of theblockade imposed on a small people. Members of thisAssembly should implement the decisions taken by theHeads of State and Government of the Non-AlignedMovement in Cartagena  by the Arab Heads of State at theCairo summit and by the African Heads of State in theYaoundé summit not to continue compliance with thesanctions resolutions. They should also consider possibleways of sparing the Libyan people more losses if thewestern countries persist in rejecting initiatives for apeaceful solution.The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya attaches the utmostimportance to the establishment of security and theenhancement of cooperation in the Mediterranean region. Itreaffirms its conviction that stability in this area will berealized only through an end to military exercises in theMediterranean  the closure of foreign military bases  thewithdrawal of foreign fleets and the development of asound formula  refuting the policy of exclusion  that wouldenable the Mediterranean countries to contribute to theenhancement of their security and the promotion ofcooperation. By virtue of its distinct location in that regionand the stability it enjoys  the Jamahiriya can play animportant role in strengthening security in theMediterranean by reducing migration from the southerncoastal States to the North and the elimination ofdestructive movements that exploit and have beenrepudiated by Islam for undermining the stability of anumber of littoral countries of the Mediterranean. TheJamahiriya would be able to play a bigger role in thesefields if the sanctions imposed on it were lifted and externalattempts to undermine its security and stability were tostop.My country supports the non-proliferation of nuclearweapons as a prelude to prohibiting and destroying allweapons of mass destruction. We welcome the internationaltreaties and conventions concluded with a view tocontrolling these destructive weapons and their ultimateelimination. In particular  my country welcomes theconclusion of the African Nuclear-Weapon-Free ZoneTreaty. However  we believe that other measures shouldbe taken to guarantee the total eradication of weapons ofmass destruction  including a timetable for the destructionof these weapons. It is necessary to take drastic andpunitive measures with regard to a major nuclear powerthat transported nuclear material to its own territory andstill procrastinates in disposing of it under internationalsupervision. It is also highly important to formulate aninternational instrument guaranteeing the security andsafety of non-nuclear States. The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty recently approved by the GeneralAssembly falls short of the aspirations of the peoples ofthe world to a total ban on all nuclear tests. Asformulated  the Treaty merely perpetuates the status quo.It could even pre-empt efforts aimed at achieving a worldtotally free from nuclear terror. In the context of othersteps that should be taken to eliminate nuclear weapons it is essential to take serious international measures toguarantee the universality of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.The Jamahiriya has a special interest in this questionbecause the region in which we live is greatly threatenedby the fact that the Israelis possess terrifying nuclearweapons with over 200 nuclear warheads. They also havenuclear facilities that they refuse to place underinternational control. What adds to our concern is the factthat  in addition to the Israeli nuclear terror whichthreatens the lives of the residents of Arab cities andvillages every day  a major nuclear Power not only turnsa blind eye to this terror  but even works to develop andenhance it. This same major Power threatens any Arabcountry  even if it was merely building a pharmaceuticalproduct factory under the pretext of saving the worldfrom chemical weapons.The existence of the Israeli nuclear arsenal cannot betaken lightly or condoned. If the international communityis truly keen to ensure the security and stability of ourregion  it should take measures to guarantee Israel’saccession to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation ofNuclear Weapons and the placing of their nuclearfacilities under the International Atomic Energy Agency’ssafeguards system. There must also be a timetable fordismantling their nuclear stockpiles. Should the failure toforce Israel to do that continue  it would be legitimate forthe countries in the area to acquire  in self-defence  meansto guarantee their safety and enable them to face theIsraeli nuclear threat to their very existence.23The world has witnessed colossal changes. If we areto adapt to these changes  we must restructure the UnitedNations to make it better able to respond to internationalneeds and to meet the interests and wishes of MemberStates.My country has followed the negotiations aimed atstrengthening the United Nations system and at reformingthe Security Council. We believe that this process  pursuedby Member States for some time now  should beaccelerated and concluded  resulting in measures that couldenhance the powers of the General Assembly  including onmatters of international peace and security.We urge that the negotiations lead to steps that wouldenable the Security Council better to carry out its mandate in conformity with the principles and purposes of theCharter. Any increase in the membership of the SecurityCouncil should be based not on a selective approach  but onthe principles of the sovereign equality of States andequitable geographic distribution  taking into considerationthe interests of the developing countries that constitute themajority of United Nations Member States. The vetoprivilege  which has become the focus of interest of mostcountries  should be at the core of the reform process.There is no longer any justification for maintaining thisprivilege. The new international arena needs a democraticSecurity Council  not one in which the few enjoydiscriminatory rights. My country  which has been in theforefront of those calling for the abrogation of the vetopower  once again urges that the measures aimed atreforming the Security Council include arrangementsultimately leading to the elimination of this privilege  whichcontradicts the principle of sovereign equality of States andalso runs counter to democracy. Preserving it would impedethe Organizations’s efforts to maintain and preserveinternational peace and security.The world cannot be secure until its economicproblems and development are addressed. Looking at theinternational scene  we find that the economies and level ofgrowth of most developing countries continue to languish.It is no exaggeration to state that these conditions maydeteriorate further if effective measures are not taken toreverse them. The Charter of the United Nations isanchored on two basic pillars: the maintenance ofinternational peace and security and internationalcooperation for economic and social development. Theclose connection between the two pillars requires the UnitedNations to strive to achieve both equally.We believe that no sound international economicenvironment can be possible without a true worldpartnership for development. This requires that North-South dialogue be resumed and that the developingcountries be enabled to participate effectively in makingdecisions affecting international economic conditions. Inthis context  commitments for promoting development indeveloping countries should be undertaken in a realisticmanner that would end trade protectionism against theexports of developing countries  lift restrictions on thetransfer of technology to them and ensure the payment ofremunerative prices for their commodities.It is essential that special priority be given to theeconomic situation in Africa and to the implementation ofthe United Nations New Agenda for the Development ofAfrica in the 1990s. The western countries have a moralduty to help end underdevelopment in Africa  given thecontinent’s suffering under colonialism  when its wealthwas plundered by these countries  which stole its naturalresources and denied it opportunities for development andprogress.As part of the efforts of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriyain the areas of economic development  environmentalprotection  expansion of agrarian reform and the provisionof drinking water  the Libyan people  in the midst of theirjoy at the start of the twenty-eighth year of the 1September revolution  have celebrated the conclusion ofthe second phase of the Great Man-Made River Project whose waters have reached the city of Tripoli  wherethere is a dense population and arable land. The Libyanpeople have realized this achievement despite the ongoingembargo and the coercive economic practices imposed onit for over a decade. These measures were recentlytightened by a law whose provisions are applicable to thecompanies of States that deal with us. This constitutes aflagrant violation of the purposes of the Charter of theUnited Nations and an intentional disregard for the rulesof international law. It is also a clear contradiction of theAgreement establishing the World Trade Organization.My country has followed with keen interest thereactions of anger and denunciation following theenactment of that law. We would like to express oursatisfaction at the inclusion of an item on this matter onthe General Assembly’s agenda for this session. We hopethat member States will discuss this question  study itcarefully and ultimately adopt a measure to thwart thislaw  through which the United States of America isattempting to impose its laws on the internationalcommunity. This Assembly should take the necessary24effective measures to end all coercive economicarrangements being imposed on a number of developingcountries  in implementation of the General Assemblyresolutions prohibiting any country from enacting extra-territorial laws or resorting to coercive measures to forceanother country to relinquish the exercise of its sovereignrights.The next century is but a few years away. Before itbegins  all the members of the international communityshould use the remaining time to eliminate all remnants ofrecent decades  which were characterized by tension andconfrontation. As we enter the third millennium  we shouldlive in a world governed by a system based on justice equality and respect for the political and economic choicesof peoples. Such a system should embody full commitmentto international law and the principles and purposes of theUnited Nations. It must protect and enhance human rightsand strengthen efforts aimed at eradicating poverty suffering  discord  conflicts  disputes and wars. It should bea system in which no country can aspire to hegemony orabuse its influence  a system that supports the peacefulsettlement of disputes. It should give all peoples theopportunity to look to the future with optimism.The United Nations remains the most valid forum andthe best tool for building a world consensus in this respect.Let us reform and strengthen this Organization so that itwill be able to meet these requirements  all of whichemanate from its aims and purposes — the establishment ofpeace and security  and the promotion of economic andsocial development in the interests of progress  welfare andprosperity for future generations."
"97",4094,"LCA",51,1996,"﻿One year ago representatives of Member States gathered in this hallowedHall and sang songs of praise in honour of the fiftiethanniversary of this venerable Organization. One year ago we faced the challenges of a changing international systemand the dawn of the new millennium with courage and hopeand in the belief that its noble ideals would guide theactions of States  great and small  in their relations withtheir fellow Members.But now that the cheering and shouting have died andthe vivid memories of the fiftieth anniversary celebrationshave started to wane  small countries like ours  Saint Lucia are forced to face the realities of survival — realities farharsher than what the bliss of that anniversary promised.It will be difficult to forget the lofty principlesexpounded during the anniversary or the excitement ofcelebrating the historic liquidation of apartheid in SouthAfrica and the restoration of democracy in Haiti. But thespeeches of this Assembly had hardly faded  the lights ofthis Hall hardly dimmed  when my country Saint Luciaand its sister islands of the Caribbean began to feel thefull blast of international hostility towards thearrangements for the marketing of our main exportcommodity  the banana  in the European Union arrangements which are enshrined in the treatyestablishing the Fourth Lomé Convention between theEuropean Union and the African  Caribbean and PacificStates.The reality of size and vulnerability always createsan awareness  a perception and a kind of resilience insmall States that make them philosophical about adversity.Consequently  we will continue to support the high idealsof this institution  but today we must focus on the hardoptions presented to us by the myopia of some largetrading nations.At the historic fiftieth session of this Assembly Saint Lucia took the opportunity to spell out to thenations of the world the very serious consequences whichwould befall our small Caribbean economies if certaincountries pursued their intention to challenge theEuropean banana regime by invoking Section 301 actionat the World Trade Organization (WTO). The UnitedStates of America itself is now pursuing this action inresponse to an application by certain Americanmultinational companies involved in the trade  and otherlarge banana-producing countries have followed their lead.The battle is now fully engaged within the WorldTrade Organization  but the conditions of war areanything but equal and the playing field is anything buteven. For example  at the behest of the complainants  thesmall countries of the Caribbean have been denied fullparticipation in the hearings of the WTO panel  despitethe fact that we are the ones who will be most affected bythe WTO ruling  whatever that may be.The diplomatic war being waged against themarketing arrangements of our main export commodity inthe name of free trade emphasizes to small nations themonumental insensitivity of some of those participating inthe process of globalization and trade liberalization nowsweeping the international community. In a process thatignores the special circumstances of the small and thevulnerable  nations like Saint Lucia and regions like theCaribbean can quickly become marginalized.6Let it be understood that we are not against theprocess of change in world trade  the globalization of theworld economy or the economic integration of continents a process currently under way. We do not wish to beLuddites in our view of the evolving international systemand thus we welcome these directions. But  on behalf of thepeoples whom we represent  on behalf of the peoples of allsmall States  we have the right to point out the dangersthese trends pose for small  developing economies ifcompensating mechanisms are not put in place. We need totell the world that these trends  these changes ininternational economic affairs  have not lessened thevulnerability of small developing States  but have in somerespects accentuated them. We need to remind this bodythat  as the international community seeks to fashion a newglobal economic system  it is imperative that it not losesight of the special needs of small States  particularly smallisland developing countries.The untrammelled pursuit of free trade for the sake offree trade cannot be the guiding philosophy of our MemberStates. Unbridled free trade which relegates some MemberStates  and in particular those with small open economies to the position of suffering spectators cannot be acceptable.It is even less acceptable when we realize that some of thevery nations that are championing the case of unrestrictedtrade liberalization do not themselves scrupulously observethat philosophy. Some of them grant huge subsidies to theirfarmers in order to allow them to continue in production yet they complain that our small farmers are not efficientproducers.Consequently  it is incumbent on the internationalcommunity to make provisions for the special needs ofsmall States in this rapidly changing international system.In the creation of free-trade areas that span continents andintegrate hemispheres  there must be special provisions forthe very small economies of our countries  particularly inregions where there are small island developing States. Inthat regard  we welcome the fact that  in the discussions onthe proposed free-trade area of the Americas  a workinggroup on smaller economies has been established tofacilitate the participation of the small economies in thatprocess.For despite the changing features of the internationalsystem  the forces that threaten the existence of these Stateshave not altered. Small island States are still veryvulnerable  for example  to natural disasters. Some of theeconomies of our fellow Member States from the Caribbeanhave yet to recover from the effects of the ravages of lastyear’s hurricanes. And in the island of Montserrat  we havea classic example of the magnitude of the damage whicha natural disaster — in this case persistent volcanicactivity — can wreak on small island developingeconomies.The plight of that small Territory is an extreme buttragically powerful symbol of why the special needs ofsmall island developing States cannot be ignored as theinternational community seeks to define new rules andeconomic relationships for the next millennium. Theinternational community and international economicinstitutions must therefore bear in mind that  while theyhave categorized some of us as middle-income developingcountries and therefore as no longer requiringconcessionary aid flows  the economic indices utilized toarrive at these classifications cannot mask the continuingreality of the vulnerability of these countries.We will  however  continue within the severelimitations of size and resources to diversify andrestructure our economies  to increase efficiency andproductivity and to adapt to the new realities. We willrely on the support of States Members of thisOrganization in this regard.There are other States in the Caribbean whoseparticular situation also deserves the special attention ofthis body. Saint Lucia once again urges the internationalcommunity to increase its technical  economic andfinancial assistance to Haiti to foster development andstability in that sister country of ours. The end of theUnited Nations Mission should not diminish internationaldevelopment support for Haiti. This is even more urgentlyneeded now to maintain and strengthen the gains achievedin the restoration of what is still a fledgling democracyand to enhance its fragile stability.Again  Saint Lucia joins its Caribbean colleagues incalling for an end to the economic blockade of Cuba.Three decades of denial have not achieved democracy.The economic embargo against Cuba is a policy whichcan hardly be called relevant in this era and it is thereforetime to try the more effective alternative of dialogue discourse and openness.In the wider international community  we areheartened by the new impetus given to the revitalizationand development of Africa and encourage Member Statesto continue to support this initiative. But we are saddenedby the persistence of ethnic disturbances in some areas ofthat continent — ethnic troubles which only serve toimpede the very development process which Member7States are trying to promote. We therefore urge the UnitedNations and regional organizations in Africa to developmechanisms for conciliation with regard to these conflicts.Saint Lucia also wishes to express its deep concern atthe recent revival of conflict in the Middle East. Is it nottime to end the anguish  to stop the pain? Is it not time tohalt the shedding of the blood of the ordinary people ofthese lands? Is it not time to bring a permanent peace to aland that means so much to so much of mankind? But thepath to true peace can only be through dialogue andconciliation and we urge all parties to return to this road for anything which is not built on that foundation will notstand.While Saint Lucia continues to promote the unificationof China  we still hold the view that Taiwan should begiven the opportunity to participate in and contribute to thework of the United Nations. Taiwan is a vibrant andgrowing democracy  capable of meeting its obligations tothis institution. As a highly developed economy  Taiwan isalso capable of contributing to the growth of other smaller less developed economies of the world. At a time when thePowers that have traditionally assisted the economicdevelopment of our countries have significantly reduced thelevel and quality of their support  new sources of assistanceshould not be ignored. We are confident that this body canfind a creative mechanism through which Taiwan can beinvolved in the programmes of the Organization. Thatinvolvement in the work of the United Nations should in noway preclude unification.We hope that this fifty-first session will not concludewithout significant progress in correcting the inequitablecomposition of the Security Council. Saint Lucia willcontinue to work within our regional and other groups toachieve the goal of strengthening the relationship betweenthe General Assembly and the Security Council institutionalizing the process of briefing and consultationand developing greater transparency and predictability.As a small nation caught up in the dynamics ofglobalization and trade liberalization  Saint Lucia lookseagerly and hopefully to the principles and ideals of theUnited Nations to offer some comfort  some protection andsome measure of security in our uncertain entry into thenew century. All the indications that herald the approach ofthis new age seem to tell us that small nations should findtheir path to development through the process ofintegration.We as a nation have a solid track record inattempting to forge deep and meaningful links between allStates members of the Organization of Eastern CaribbeanStates and the Caribbean Community. In bothorganizations  we continue to build viable mechanismsand institutions which will achieve a meaningfulconsolidation of the various units of the CaribbeanCommunity. We have progressed even further andparticipated in the launching of a brave initiative  theAssociation of Caribbean States. This Association ignoresthe barriers of race  language and culture and seeks tounify all countries which border and are part of theCaribbean Sea.We urge this Organization  through its variousagencies  to continue to provide support for the regionalintegration efforts of developing countries. On manyoccasions in the past  it has been the work of some of theUnited Nations agencies which has helped sustain someof these regional economic integration schemes and giventhem the impetus to move forward. For its part  SaintLucia will continue to toil in the cause of the closer unionof the peoples and States of the Caribbean because this isthe only logic for our survival. This is the path to theenhancement of the quality of life of our peoples.The plight which our country faces as a result of themanipulation of the European banana market regime andof the unconscionable pressures exerted by the activitiesof some States on that market  is desperate. We wish toremind the Assembly that we are relying on the principlesand ideals of this body to stand firmly in the corner of thesmall and vulnerable and to frustrate the designs of somemultinational corporations which threaten our livelihood.We reiterate our call to the United Nations to develop aframework of international review and regulationsregarding the activities and policies of transnationalcorporations  which are assuming leviathan proportions inworld trade.I commend you  Sir  on your elevation to thepresidency of the General Assembly at fifty-first sessionand pledge Saint Lucia’s support for the successfulexecution of your enormous responsibilities. My countryalso pledges with customary diligence to assist the UnitedNations in implementing the goals of the Charter andfostering the spirit of freedom and independence whichthe fiftieth anniversary year of the Organizationemphasized. Our small size will not be a deterrent in ourpursuit of democracy and peace.8"
"98",4121,"LIE",51,1996,"﻿At the outset I should liketo congratulate Ambassador Razali Ismail on his election asPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-first session.The Liechtenstein delegation is confident that his leadershipwill strengthen the United Nations ability to pursue thepurposes and principles of the Charter.One year after the celebration of the fiftiethanniversary of the United Nations  it is appropriate to takestock once again of the achievements and shortcomings ofour Organization and  first and foremost  to define themeasures we have to take in order to face the challengesthat lie ahead of us. One of the recurrent topics at thefiftieth session of the General Assembly was the call for acomprehensive and effective reform with a view both toenhancing the efficiency of the United Nations and toreducing the costs of its work.I wish to express my appreciation for all the effortsthat have been made by the Secretariat to meet this need particularly to the Department of Administration andManagement and to the Office of Internal OversightServices  which have made an important contribution in thisregard. However  it remains a fact that more needs to bedone in order to cope with the financial crisis theOrganization continues to struggle with. Even though thereseems to be a consensus concerning the need for furthersuch action  we were not able  during the fiftieth session ofthe General Assembly  to reach agreement on the measuresthat are so urgently needed. In our view  it is of the utmostimportance that the high-level working group on thefinancial situation established by the General Assemblyshould adopt  during the fifty-first session  proposals for asolution of the financial crisis  including the payment ofarrears. I should like to take this opportunity to express thesupport of the Government of Liechtenstein for theproposals that have been put forward by the EuropeanUnion in this respect.We support ongoing efforts with a view to a reformand enlargement of the Security Council. We are of theview that the reform of the Security Council should beconsistent with the principle of the sovereign equality ofall States  as enshrined in the Charter. Liechtensteinagrees with those Member countries that have said thatwith regard to the distribution of new permanent seats the financial and other contributions to achieving thepurposes of the Organization as well as a balancedgeographic distribution should be adequately taken intoaccount.Another area of crucial importance for the futurework and credibility of our Organization is peacekeepingactivities  which attract the particular interest and concernof the world community. The experience of the recentpast has made it very clear that the United Nations needsto be better equipped in order to respond effectively andquickly to prevent situations that threaten internationalpeace and security. If we are to enhance the credibility ofthe United Nations as a whole and the effectiveness ofUnited Nations peace-keeping operations  we have toensure that every such mission is given a clear mandateand vested with the funds necessary for its fullimplementation. Very useful proposals to that end havebeen made by the Secretary-General in his report entitled“An Agenda for Peace”. We have noted with satisfactionthe progress made by the Working Group established bythe General Assembly to discuss the Agenda for Peace and the provisional agreements reached by two of the foursubgroups dealing with specific aspects of the Agenda forPeace. I wish to express my hope that the two othersubgroups  which have to discuss the very importantquestions of preventive diplomacy and peacemaking  andpost-conflict peace-building  respectively  will also beable to conclude their work soon  so a comprehensiveagreement on the Agenda for Peace can be adopted.Some of the events that have taken place over thepast few years have made it very clear that more attentionshould be given to preventive diplomacy  which can averthuman suffering and reduce costs considerably. One ofthe situations where determined preventive action isurgently needed is the one that has arisen in Burundi where patterns of large-scale violations of human rightsand the risk of a further worsening of the situation10continue to exist. It is indeed disturbing to note that theinternational community has not been able to take allpossible measures to prevent a further deterioration of thissituation.Liechtenstein made its own contribution to thefurthering of conflict prevention by introducing an initiativeon the right of self-determination before the GeneralAssembly at its forty-eighth session. It has been statedmany times that the vast majority of armed or other violentconflicts today are no longer conflicts between but withinStates. Such conflicts often have their roots in tensionsbetween communities living within States  and the thrust ofthe initiative of Liechtenstein is aimed at finding peacefulsolutions to such situations before one of the partiesinvolved resorts to violence. It seems to us that the right ofself-determination  the exercise of which has played acrucial role in the history of the United Nations progressively needs to be seen outside its traditional contextand should be further developed and adapted to theconditions that prevail in today’s world.Many cases of intra-State conflicts have made clearthat it is timely and necessary for the internationalcommunity to develop mechanisms that will enablecommunities living within States to exercise the right ofself-determination in flexible ways and in accordance withexisting international law. The Liechtenstein researchprogramme that was established at Princeton University aspart of the contribution of Liechtenstein to the celebrationof the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations is intendedto provide further know-how for  and assistance in developing such mechanisms  and I should like to take thisopportunity to thank all those countries that continue tosupport us in this endeavour.As a small State  Liechtenstein attaches the utmostimportance to strengthening international law and toeffective disarmament. We therefore actively supported thedraft resolution  submitted by Australia on behalf of a largenumber of countries  that enabled us to adopt theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) afterlengthy and very difficult negotiations in the Conference onDisarmament. The CTBT will take us one step furthertowards achieving our goal of a world free of nuclearweapons. The Government of Liechtenstein is of the viewthat it is a crucial step. Tomorrow  therefore  I will sign theCTBT on behalf of Liechtenstein  and I would like toexpress our hope that as many countries as possible will dothe same.One year ago we met in Beijing and unanimouslyadopted a Declaration and a Platform for Action thatrepresent a new international commitment to the goals ofequality  development and peace for all women in theworld. In Liechtenstein we are in the process of preparingthe implementation of the Platform for Action  whichincludes  inter alia: motivation for women to enterpolitics and to present their candidatures; specificacademic and vocational guidance for girls; measures tofacilitate the compatibility of professional and family life;and sensitization towards the problem of violence againstwomen and children.Peace is a prerequisite for the attainment of equalitybetween women and men. Unfortunately  aggression andarmed and other types of conflict persist in many parts ofthe world. Women rarely have any role in the decisionsleading to armed conflicts  but they contribute to a largeextent to preserving social order in times of war andarmed conflicts. We believe that women could and shouldplay an increased role in conflict resolution  and wewould particularly welcome more women being appointedas Special Representatives of the Secretary-General.There has been a dramatic growth in the need forhumanitarian assistance in recent years. The UnitedNations system  playing a major role in the field ofhumanitarian relief  has been tested almost to breakingpoint by recent crises. Complex emergency situationshave resulted in increased demands on scarce resources.There has been criticism that as a result of concentrationon emergency relief  little effort was made to deviserecovery programmes. The humanitarian community willhave to play an important role in ensuring the transitionfrom relief to rehabilitation. We should not forget however  that it has been only four years sincehumanitarian action provided by the United Nationssystem was given structure and coherence.Anti-personnel land-mines  with their immenselydestructive effects on individuals and communities aroundthe world  are a humanitarian tragedy. Innocent civilians in particular women  children  refugees and displacedpersons  are at greatest risk. Furthermore  mines impedethe rehabilitation and reconstruction of societies torn bywar. In keeping with its mandate to develop and promoteinternational humanitarian law  the InternationalCommittee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has continuouslycalled attention to weapons whose effects threaten toundermine that law  and we commend the ICRC for itsefforts in that respect. I wish to reiterate our call for atotal ban on these deadly weapons.We hope that  during this fifty-first session of theGeneral Assembly  we will be able to strengthen the UnitedNations  which has been indispensable to the internationalcommunity for more than 50 years  and to enhance itscredibility in the eyes of the peoples whom ourOrganization represents."
"99",4168,"LKA",51,1996,"﻿For Sri Lanka it is amatter of particular pride and pleasure that we have adistinguished representative of an Asian country  Malaysia presiding over the fifty-first session of the GeneralAssembly. Sri Lanka and Malaysia have long enjoyed thewarmest ties of friendship. We congratulate the President and offer him our unstinted support. We also wish toexpress our appreciation of the contribution made to thesuccess of the historic fiftieth session by His ExcellencyDiogo Freitas do Amaral of Portugal.Last year at our Special Commemorative Meeting wepledged to bequeath to the twenty-first century a UnitedNations equipped  financed and structured to serveeffectively the people in whose name it was established.This pledge we must not fail to honour. The peoples of theworld will be watching us closely during this session andthereafter to see how well we are proceeding to redeem thepromise we made last year in such fine phrases andrhetoric.The financial constraints confronting theOrganization have tempered the once heady enthusiasmamong nations for radical reform. Sober pragmaticconclusions now seem inevitable. Yet we must rememberthat our task  as Sri Lanka’s President pointed out lastyear  is to:“enhance the capacity of the United Nations  ratherthan merely effect economies and scale down itsscope.” (Official Records of the General Assembly Fiftieth Session  Plenary Meetings  35th meeting p. 9)A viable resource base for the United Nations can beassured not only by effecting greater financialresponsibility and sound management  but also  moreurgently  by a serious commitment by all Members tohonour the financial obligations they are bound to complywith within the terms of the Charter.We agree that the Secretariat of our Organizationneeds to be rationalized further. The Organization is now I believe  sufficiently mature to effect cuts where cuts aredue. Programmes affecting developing countries need tobe lean  effective and sustainable  which is not the sameas saying they should not be touched. Prudent  well-conceived economies could be  and have been  put intoeffect. We must reform  not deform  the Organization.Above all  the United Nations desperately needs a soundfinancial base. Without that  there will be no prospect ofbuilding the streamlined  efficient and effective worldOrganization that we all dream of. We will merely wasteour time and energy building castles in the air.The working groups on the question of equitablerepresentation on and increase in the membership of theSecurity Council and on the strengthening of the UnitedNations system have made some progress  although nofinality has been reached in regard to the main areas offocus. We believe  however  that these efforts shouldcontinue. We should redouble our energies to reachconsensus.The main organs of the United Nations  it must beemphasized  will be credible and effective only to theextent that they secure the confidence of the generalmembership and ensure that their decisions enjoy generalacceptance. With regard to the Security Council  it is ourview that today’s political and economic realities  ratherthan yesterday’s military power  need to be reflected in anydecisions to be taken on questions such as that of thepermanent membership of the Council and the enlargementof its overall membership.The United Nations must neither master nor servantbe.First  despite fashionable theories about the need tolimit national sovereignty  the members of the Organizationremain sovereign  independent States. Each State  howeversmall and weak it may be  jealously guards its sovereignty.Hence  where the United Nations intervenes  it should do soexpressly within the terms of the Charter. The consent andcooperation of States are vital to ensure the success of anyUnited Nations endeavour which impinges on the territoryof a Member State. Only such an approach would guaranteethe safety and security of United Nations personnel and thewelfare and interests of the people in the receiving State.In playing its role in conflict resolution andpeacemaking  it is important that our Organization shouldnot stray into domestic issues and conflicts which arewithin the domestic jurisdiction of the States concerned.The Organization should play its role only with theacceptance of the countries concerned. This position arisesfrom the simple logic that the States concerned are bestequipped  in the first instance  to deal with these issues being familiar with the socio-economic milieu in whichthey arise. Otherwise  United Nations action could becounter-productive and could lead even to the exacerbationof conflicts. Nor should United Nations mandates be usedto serve the interests of any one State or group of States.The United Nations must not be used as a franchise to givelegitimacy to causes that may not reflect the general will ofthe membership  on whose behalf the Security Councilshould act at all times.Now more than ever before we must reaffirm ourcollective respect for the fundamental principles of theCharter of the United Nations. The smaller nations of theworld must receive constant reassurance from the largernations that their interests will be safeguarded and theirsovereignty respected. The smaller nations have only theUnited Nations to look to for the protection of theirnational interests.First  translated into practical terms  developingcountries  which are under-represented  need to have theirnumbers increased in the Security Council. Secondly there are Member States in the Organization whichadvance arguments to support permanent seats in theCouncil no less cogent than the arguments tendered 50years ago to justify the special status of the current fivepermanent members.My delegation also notes the useful discussions thathave taken place on the subject of “An Agenda forPeace”. We feel that further work needs to be done in thisarea.The subject matter of the Agenda for Developmentis of crucial importance. It underlies the central role ofour Organization in the field of economic cooperation anddevelopment. While noting the progress that has beenachieved in this endeavour  we should reiterate ourcommitment to move speedily in this area which vitallyconcerns the economic advancement and stability ofdeveloping countries.I turn now to the problem of terrorism. The epithet“terrorist” has been too often hurled unjustifiably atgenuine national liberation movements  those  forinstance  which struggled against foreign occupation andapartheid. The legitimacy of such organizations has beenrecognized by the United Nations. They are organizationswhich have sat with us here to discuss the issues whichhad compelled them to armed action. We are happy to seethose true movements of the people now occupying seatsin this Organization as full Members. We should notspend time seeking to evolve a comprehensive definitionof terrorism  lest we become helplessly mired in asemantic minefield. An international consensus againstterrorism  based on the recognition of stark reality  hasmatured over the years. It is imperative now to implementthat consensus.The world is aware that Sri Lanka has been rackedwith the anguish of a violent ethnic conflict which hassapped our energies for almost two decades. We have2been dealing for many years with an armed group whichseeks to dismember our country by violent means  resortingto terrorism as a means of achieving this illegitimate goal.This group — the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam(LTTE) — has been perpetrating a series of terroristic acts causing death and destruction in many parts of my country.This extremist group does not in any meaningful senserepresent the people they claim to fight for. They havenever sought a mandate from the people at an election.They have kept out of the democratic mainstream  whenmany of the minority parties have entered the consultativeprocess to seek redress for their grievances throughdemocratic means.We are working on a set of proposals introduced bymy Government to address minority grievances  whichincludes far reaching constitutional changes.The LTTE does not believe in the path of peacefulnegotiations  having put their faith in the power of the gun.The peace process  they fear  would marginalize them;hence the recourse to increased violence. We are awarethat — in terms of finance  equipment and war matériel —this group draws support from persons outside our country but not from other States. There is not a single State thatsupports them either in word or deed. They receive supportfrom misguided members of the Tamil community who liveand work in the affluent countries  or through extortion drug trafficking  gun-running  people-smuggling or otherillegal activities in many developed countries  in abuse ofthe hospitality of the host Governments and in violation oftheir laws.In Sri Lanka  the terrorists have deliberately targetedcivilians. They have bombed a rush-hour commuter trainand busy office buildings and have shot up rural villages causing the death of thousands of innocent civilians including large numbers of women and children. Manythousands have been injured and maimed. As Sri Lanka’sPresident emphasized last year at the fiftieth-anniversarysession  concerted international action is essential to combatterrorism and compel terrorists to renounce violence.On that occasion President Clinton remarked that noone was immune from terrorism.The summit meeting of the Group of Seven andRussia in Lyon and the subsequent ministerial meeting onterrorism in Paris took bold initiatives which need to bedeveloped into practical action. The proposals for aconvention on terrorist bombings and the proposals toprevent the abuse of asylum and refugee laws areparticularly timely initiatives. Sri Lanka looks forward totheir elaboration during this session.Efforts need also to be made to further strengthenand give legal effect to the 1994 Declaration on Measuresto Eliminate International Terrorism. Now we need morethan a mere declaration; we need a convention onmeasures to combat terrorism. Concerted internationalcooperation is necessary to ensure that the terrorist doesnot enjoy safe havens anywhere in the world. Theterritory of no State should be permitted to be used in anymanner that would encourage or sustain terrorist activityin another. Fund-raising activity on foreign soil inparticular  either directly or indirectly through so-calledcharitable funds  must be prohibited. Should terrorism bepermitted through international apathy to fester  it wouldpoison the international body politic  enervatingdemocratic processes  processes the internationalcommunity is obliged to sustain.It would be myopic for a nation to stand aloof or todisown responsibility for combating acts of terrorismwhich may seem too distant to evoke anything more thancuriosity. With the English poet John Donne  I would say “never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls forthee.” Terrorists have the means to move freely acrossborders  have used chemical weapons  and could wellhave access to nuclear weapons.Global interdependence is undoubtedly a modernreality. However  opinions vary on the real implicationsof that phenomenon on the economies of developingcountries. In the development debate  globalization andthe call for integration into a single global economic gridare held out as the primary or even the sole option fordeveloping countries seeking cooperation with developedcountries.But cooperation must not be confused withconformity. The specific character of individualdeveloping countries  including the social and politicalcompulsions facing their Governments  needs to be takeninto account. Globalization involves the free flow ofcapital  the liberalization of trade  the privatization ofState enterprises  the freezing of price controls and thescaling down of welfare measures even for the mostvulnerable sectors of the population. These have notalways proved to be a panacea for those developingcountries which have accepted them as economicinjunctions.3It is important that such institutions as the WorldTrade Organization  the successor institution to GATT  besensitive to the concerns of developing countries in suchmatters as external investment flows  which should not beclogged with linkages to issues more relevant to otherorganizations and institutions. Similarly  while sound socialand environmental policies are essential for all societies arbitrarily imposed standards should not be used as excusesfor trade discrimination or concealed protectionism. TheGovernment of Sri Lanka has provided opportunities for itsprivate sector to advance as the principal engine of growth.Sri Lanka continues to welcome investment — economicand technological collaboration with foreign entrepreneurson the basis of mutual benefit. These efforts  however would be negated if such economic cooperation werepursued only on terms overwhelmingly favourable to oneside.Despite the pressures and tensions caused by asituation of conflict  we have succeeded in keeping our olddemocratic institutions and traditions alive and strong. Wegive our best attention to the protection and promotion ofhuman rights. In furthering an elected Government’saccountability to its own people  the Government of SriLanka has taken several measures to strengthen the legalframework and ensure the effective implementation ofhuman-rights standards. One of the significant measures wetook this year was the establishment by act of Parliament ofa Human Rights Commission. We have ensured that the actguarantees independence of action for the Commission. Theareas of competence of the Commission include monitoring investigative and advisory functions. The act also addressesthe question of liability of non-State actors for human-rightsviolations.My Government has decided to accede to the OptionalProtocol to the International Covenant on Civil and PoliticalRights as a logical next step in a series of nationalmeasures. Sri Lanka will thus be among the few countriesthat have taken the progressive decision to ratify theOptional Protocol. The Government has given the highestpriority to Sri Lanka’s obligations under internationalcovenants and we are committed to continuing ourcooperation with United Nations human-rights mechanisms.Looking at the world  we see that  in Bosnia following the Dayton Agreement  the guns have beenfinally silenced  and we are happy to note that the peaceAgreement is holding up. Sri Lanka has condemned theatrocities committed in Bosnia  particularly the inhumanand cruel treatment of the Muslims. We believe that asettlement will not be complete unless those responsiblefor the atrocities are brought to justice.In the Middle East  we hope the peace process willmove on  without losing the momentum it had gained despite the changes in the political scene in that area. SriLanka reiterates its support for the peace process  therealization of the inalienable rights of the Palestinianpeople and the establishment of conditions of peace andstability for all States in the region to live within secureboundaries. We commend the efforts taken by the UnitedStates of America  other concerned States and the Statesof the region to achieve the objective of bringing peace tothe Middle East.We share the concerns of the world community inregard to the crises that have overtaken Liberia andBurundi and express our fervent hope that peace will berestored to these troubled regions.In our own region  South Asia  we have recordedprogress in our efforts at regional cooperation. Wecelebrated the tenth anniversary of the South AsianAssociation for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) lastDecember  heralded by the coming into force of the SouthAsian Preferential Trade Arrangement. SAARC has setitself the goal of achieving a South Asian free-trade areaby the early years of the new century. The private sectorsof our region are engaged in close cooperation. Weremain deeply committed to our abiding concern ofalleviating  if not eradicating  poverty in our countrieswithin a realistic time-frame.Sri Lanka has turned increasingly towards promotingeconomic cooperation with countries in the Asia-Pacificregion with which we identify closely. We see regionalcooperation as a source of political stability as well asmutual economic benefit. We have recently become apartner in the Indian Ocean rim initiative. We haveapplied for membership of the Asia-Pacific EconomicCooperation Council. We also expect that  when therequired ratifications are completed  the Indian OceanMarine Affairs Cooperation will provide a further impetusto technical and other cooperation among Indian Oceancountries. At the political level  Sri Lanka  with othermembers of the United Nations Ad Hoc Committee onthe Indian Ocean  is reviewing the concept of the IndianOcean as a zone of peace in the light of current realitiesin the region.I wish to refer at this point to the Non-AlignedMovement  of which Sri Lanka is a founding member.4Today — 26 September — is a particularly significant datefor Sri Lanka  which commemorates a great patriot  the lateS.W.R.D. Bandaranaike  who was assassinated on this date.He was Prime Minister from 1956 to 1959. He ushered ina uniquely peaceful  non-violent transformation of SriLankan society. His electoral victory in 1956 led to theempowerment of the rural  the underprivileged  the mass ofthe people of the country  and set the country’s foreignpolicy firmly towards non-alignment.Two days ago  we celebrated the thirty-fifthanniversary of the founding  in a formal sense  of the Non-Aligned Movement. Mr. Bandaranaike did not live to seethe Non-Aligned Movement firmly established in 1961.However  in 1956  40 years ago  he addressed this GeneralAssembly and said:“We are supposed to be the uncommitted' nations. Istrongly object to that word. We are committed up tothe hilt. We are committed to preserve decency indealings between nations  we are committed to thecause of justice and freedom....“No doubt the prevention of war is a necessary factorfor peace  but peace  believe me  is something muchmore positive than that  for peace in its true sensemeans human understanding  human friendship andcooperation out of which  indeed  peace in its trueform alone can arise. I look upon the United Nationsas the one machine available to mankind todaythrough which it can express this unconquerable spiritof man in its efforts to achieve that peace  friendshipand collaboration.” (Official Records of the GeneralAssembly  Eleventh Session  Plenary Meetings  590thmeeting  p. 234-35)The policies he initiated in respect of Sri Lanka —and I confine my remarks to foreign policy — were carriedforward by his successor  Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike who  as Prime Minister  attended the first Non-Alignedsummit in Belgrade in 1961 and subsequently presided overthe fifth summit of the Movement in Colombo.The Movement  which has a membership of 113countries  is today the largest grouping of independentsovereign States in the world  apart from the UnitedNations itself  which have come together with the commonobjective of achieving peace  prosperity and the welfare oftheir people  a majority of whom belong to the third world.With the end of the cold war  there were sceptics whothought that the Movement would die in the absence of aclear role for the future. We have been able to dispel thismisapprehension and chart a new course for theMovement. It has emerged today as the voice of the thirdworld  of the smaller countries which are crying out fora place in the sun and demanding opportunities foreconomic development and self-expression.Although the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation ofNuclear Weapons has been extended indefinitely  it is tobe remembered that the total elimination of nuclearweapons is the ultimate end of the non-proliferationprocess. As a member of the Conference onDisarmament  our delegation has worked hard to ensurethat all nuclear testing be banned as an interim measure leading eventually to the total elimination of all nuclearweapons. The text of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty adopted by the General Assembly a few daysago was the result of several years' patient negotiations yet its terms do not contain a firm and clear commitmentto nuclear disarmament and the total elimination of allnuclear weapons. We would have expected the scope ofprohibition to be truly comprehensive and the provisionsfor entry into force not to be self-debilitating. We lookforward to the entry into force of the Chemical WeaponsConvention as well as the Convention relating tobacteriological and toxin weapons.Sri Lanka remains a loyal and dedicated Member ofthe United Nations committed to upholding the nobleprinciples of the Charter. Our faith and trust in this greatinstitution  fashioned half a century ago  despite all itsweaknesses and failures discerned in the interveningyears  remains steadfast. These blemishes are after all buta mirror-image of the infirmities and inadequacies of allhuman kind. So we have no need to be either discouragedor despondent. We stand firm in the belief that the UnitedNations is still the best hope for this world. Indeed  wehave no alternative or option in this matter  for to give uphope is only to slide into the depths of despair.But our hopes for the United Nations must begrounded in action  in a firm resolve to act decisively inthe best interests of this great institution  indeed of allhumanity  untainted by the narrow national interestswhich have dogged our path in the course of these pastfive decades. This is no easy task  but unless we remainunyielding in our determination to ensure that the UnitedNations remains faithful to the tasks envisioned by itsfounders  we will have failed the generations that followus in the twenty-first century.5"
"100",4210,"LSO",51,1996,"﻿I wish to extend mydelegation’s sincere congratulations to you  Sir  on yourelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at itsfifty-first session. It is with great pleasure that I assure youof Lesotho’s support and cooperation as you conduct thedeliberations of this body. Let me also take this opportunityto pay special tribute to your predecessor  Mr. DiogoFreitas do Amaral  for the skilful manner in which heguided the work of the historic session of the GeneralAssembly last year. My delegation truly appreciates hisleadership and his tireless dedication to the heavyresponsibilities entrusted to him during the past year.I also take this opportunity to express our satisfactionwith the sterling work that the Secretary-General Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  has been doing under the verydifficult conditions of reduced financial resources. Were itnot for his tenacity  our Organization would not have beenable to hold together as it has done.The celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of theUnited Nations last year provided an opportunity forreflection about the global mission of our Organization. Weretraced our past and took stock of the failures and notablesuccesses that the United Nations had engraved in thehistoric record of half a century of its existence. We alsolooked ahead with renewed determination  resolved tocreate for mankind a future that would be brighter than thepast  amidst the euphoria of hope and expectation in thenew international order that is still emerging from the ashesof the cold war.Even as we did so  we were aware how great thepotential was for a relapse to the pitfalls of past years andfor the re-emergence of complacencies that could renderour new hopes and expectations vain and futile. Adeliberate effort is required on the part of the internationalcommunity to build on the past experiences of ourOrganization and to identify and reinforce the positivetrends that the end of the cold war era has yielded.The first half-century was characterized by cold-warconflicts  the struggle against colonialism  the constantthreat of a nuclear holocaust and the fight againstapartheid. All these are either behind us or considerablyabated. Our attention must remain focused on how we cangive the twenty-first century a United Nations equippedto serve as an effective instrument in the evolving globalenvironment for the attainment of the noble goalsenshrined in its Charter.A universal consensus for the reform andrevitalization of the United Nations was highlighted in thesolemn Declaration that was adopted in this very Hall ayear ago by  inter alia  128 world Heads of State andGovernment. The momentum for the realization of thataspiration and for the implementation of the commitmentsthat were made by the world community should not belost. The actions and the path that we have to take areknown to all of us.We would like to see a more democratized UnitedNations  whose credibility and legitimacy are enhanced bythe representativeness of its structures.We have identified the need for measures to ensuregreater consultation between the Security Council and theGeneral Assembly  particularly on crisis situations  andthe need to restore the role and authority of the GeneralAssembly in the decision-making processes of ourOrganization  without compromising the speed with whichthe Security Council may take its decisions.We have cautioned against regional selectivity in theattention paid by our Organization to international crisissituations and have advocated a demonstration of goodfaith and the upholding of the principle of the sanctity ofhuman life in the enforcement of United Nationsresolutions.We have also stood in favour of exploring a new balanced formula for equitable burden-sharing  as well asfor a renewed commitment on the part of all MemberStates to fulfil their financial obligations to the UnitedNations in full and on time  just as we have joined in thecall to effect economies and improve efficiency throughthe transformation of the management techniques withinthe United Nations system.14The events and experiences we have witnessed sincethe last session of the Assembly once again present us withmixed signals. On the one hand  we have seen a steadyexpansion of the frontiers of peace  tolerance anddemocracy  while  on the other  some problems that arerooted in the past not only have persisted but have beencompounded by new challenges arising from the evolvinginternational environment.Thanks to the efforts of the international community the carnage in the former Yugoslavia has been brought toan end. However  a conscious effort is still required to givepermanence to the positive trends that are still evolving inBosnia and to suppress the ever present risk that the peacedividends already gained can be reversed.In the Middle East uncertainty and the new obstaclesthat have emerged in the path of a negotiated peace havethrown new doubts over the prospects for an earlyrestoration to the Palestinian people of their inalienableright to self-determination and statehood. We appeal to bothIsrael and the Palestinian Authority to adhere in good faithto the provisions of the peace agreements they haveconcluded and to implement them within the agreed time-frame  pursuant to the Declaration of Principles they signedin Washington in 1993.The prerequisite for peace remains the withdrawal ofIsrael and the cessation of the establishment of new Israelisettlements in the occupied Arab and Palestinian territories in compliance with the resolutions of the United Nations.In Western Sahara recent developments havedemonstrated that peace in that area remains elusive. Howlong will the will of the Saharan people for self-determination and independence be frustrated? Thewithdrawal of the United Nations Mission for theReferendum in Western Sahara in May of this year due tothe lack of cooperation by the parties raises a real prospectfor a resumption of violence. The international communitymust act now to reverse the tragic trends and to persuadethe parties to cooperate in the implementation of the UnitedNations plan for the independence of Western Sahara.In Burundi  Liberia and Somalia the situationregrettably continues to defy the efforts of the internationalcommunity to restore peace and stability. We appeal to theinternational community to support the current initiativesspearheaded by the Organization of African Unity and theneighbouring countries of Burundi aimed at protectingdemocracy in that country.Lesotho shares Africa’s deep disappointment at thedemonstrable lack of interest on the part of theinternational community in extending the necessarymaterial support to the Economic Community of WestAfrican States (ECOWAS) Monitoring Group(ECOMOG) countries that are engaged in the regionalpeacekeeping effort in Liberia. This  regrettably  calls intoquestion the world’s commitment to the universality ofthe sanctity of human life.Despite the remaining hotbeds of instability fortunately all is not doom and gloom in Africa  even inthe area of conflict resolution. The major strides that havebeen made in southern Africa to free the subregion ofconflicts is a source of great satisfaction. If themomentum for peace is kept in Angola  there is no doubtthat a subregion long associated with conflicts will haveestablished durable peace and stability. Theimplementation of the Lusaka Protocol — particularly theestablishment of a unified army and the formation of theGovernment of National Unity — are within reach  andwith more concerted action by the internationalcommunity should soon be attained.Throughout southern Africa  political stability  peace democracy and human rights continue to be deepened.Multiparty general elections are being held  and otherpolitical and constitutional reforms are being put in placeto ensure transparency and predictability  especially in theelectoral systems.The establishment by the Southern AfricanDevelopment Community of the Organ on Politics Defence and Security reaffirms the region’s resolve toconsolidate the gains that have been bequeathed by thedemise of apartheid and to face head-on the challenges ofpeace and democracy.These measures have contributed to the strongperformance registered by the national economies ofsouthern Africa in 1995  as well as to the improvement inthe overall investment climate of the region. We hope thatthe international community will continue to assistsouthern Africa in its reconstruction efforts  particularlyby encouraging the flow of private investment as acontribution to the regional efforts for the economicrecovery of the subcontinent.The past 12 months have presented the world withgreat opportunities for the attainment of durable peace.Yet  I regret to say  we have sometimes failed to takeadvantage of them. A scourge that has stalked humankind15for the past 50 years has been the growth in the arsenal ofarmaments  especially nuclear ones. Last year  in a historicachievement  the nations of the world agreed to extendindefinitely the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of NuclearWeapons. In doing so they undertook to achieve acomprehensive test-ban treaty by September of this year.It is with unbounded joy that we are able to stand heretoday and say that that goal has been attained. To be sure it was not attained with ease  but the fact that it wasachieved is a source of great encouragement thathumankind is slowly but surely moving towards the totalelimination of nuclear weapons. Although Lesotho sharesthe view that the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty(CTBT) that was adopted here in New York last month isnot perfect  we regard it as a giant step forward that willserve to put the nuclear-weapon States on notice that therest of the international community is serious about itsaspiration to a nuclear-free world.In spite of the fact that the cold war has ended andthat the START Treaties have been concluded  tens ofthousands of nuclear weapons are still deployed by nuclearStates  and there is a very real possibility that many moreStates could develop such weapons.Worldwide opposition to weapons of mass destructionhas resulted in Conventions banning biological andchemical weapons  but as yet there are no concreteproposals to negotiate a similar convention to outlawnuclear weapons. The fact that nuclear weapons are notprohibited by convention weakens the willingness of manynon-nuclear States to abide by the Biological WeaponsConvention and the Chemical Weapons Convention. TheseStates perceive an imbalance in the retention of certaintypes of weapons of mass destruction by some States mostly States of the North  while other weapons of massdestruction  often held by States of the South — arebanned.Lesotho believes that the proliferation of nuclear-weapons technology and the manufacture of nuclearweapons constitute a very serious problem which theinternational community cannot and must not ignore.The fact that only a handful of people have beenbrought to justice for the millions of crimes againsthumanity and the serious violations of humanitarian lawcommitted since the end of the Second World War has notaltered the international community’s view that perpetratorsof international crimes should be tried and punished fortheir acts. More recently  the growing global outrage againstinternational crimes has been demonstrated by thecreation of the two ad hoc International Tribunals for theprosecution of crimes in the former Yugoslavia and inRwanda. These Tribunals were established by the SecurityCouncil to have jurisdiction over the most heinous crimesin the world: genocide  other crimes against humanity andserious violations of humanitarian law.It is therefore a matter of concern that since theirinception both Tribunals have been plagued by inadequateand short-term financing and have not received adequatebudgets from this Assembly. It is also a matter of concernthat very few Member States have enacted legislationpermitting effective cooperation with the Tribunals.The international community must send a clearmessage to those who commit genocide and other crimesagainst humanity that they cannot escape to fully accountfor their actions before international law. We can do thisby providing the much-needed support and resources toenable the ad hoc International Tribunals to bring tojustice those who are responsible for atrocities both inBosnia and in Rwanda.Although Lesotho has not yet promulgatedimplementation legislation for the Tribunals  it remainscommitted to fully cooperating with the two Tribunals inaccordance with the provisions of Security Councilresolutions. We hope that the international community canbuild on the experiences and the already noteworthysuccess achieved by these Tribunals to pursue the projectof the establishment of a permanent international criminalcourt.While we recognize the important work of thePreparatory Committee on the Establishment of anInternational Criminal Court  we are of the view that theGeneral Assembly should enhance the PreparatoryCommittee’s work by mandating it to begin seriousnegotiations of a consolidated draft treaty based on theInternational Law Commission’s 1994 draft statute. Thepresent momentum for the establishment of a permanentinternational criminal tribunal should not be lost  butshould be matched by commensurate political will toensure that the work is completed in time for aconference in 1998.Development and the promotion of internationalcooperation as enshrined in the Charter  will continue tobe the principal objectives of the United Nations. Therecently concluded mid-term review of the United NationsNew Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s16has shown that many of the social and economic problemswhich led to the adoption of the Agenda in 1991 still existand that poverty and unemployment in Africa are expectedto increase substantially. Furthermore  the estimatedresource mobilization levels in the Agenda are still far frombeing attained.Consequently  the mid-term review recommended thatAfrican Governments should continue to promote  interalia  economic reforms  respect for human rights andfundamental freedoms  good governance and administrativereform. For their part  international partners should seek tomobilize substantial new resources from all sources —public and private — and from traditional and new sources to find a solution to Africa’s external debt problem and toenhance Africa’s recovery through trade facilitation andimproved market access.The United Nations System-wide Special Initiative forAfrica  which was launched by the Secretary-General inMarch this year  promises to break new ground by assuringthe cooperation of the whole system  including the BrettonWoods institutions  in tackling the intractable problem ofaccelerating the development of the African continent.While this expression of interest in our continent isappreciated  we must also stress that the implementation ofthe several initiatives currently on the table must be carriedout in very close consultation with the African countriesthemselves  to avoid the duplication of efforts. TheOrganization of African Unity’s Cairo Plan of Action isrelevant in this regard.As we engage in this introspection one year after ourhistoric Declaration on the Occasion of the FiftiethAnniversary of the United Nations  it is pertinent to inquireto what extent we are all fulfilling our commitmentundertaken during the various global conferences  all ofwhich — except the Vienna World Conference on HumanRights — have a development dimension. Perhaps the onethat towers above all others in its significance foralleviating the plight of citizens of least developedcountries  such as mine  is last year’s Copenhagen WorldSummit for Social Development.In Lesotho there is a serious effort to attain the targetof devoting 20 per cent of our budget to the health andeducation sectors  but we have not witnessed acorresponding commitment on the part of our developmentpartners  as was agreed at Copenhagen.The Commission for Social Development has beengiven the primary responsibility for the follow-up andreview of the implementation of the CopenhagenDeclaration and Programme of Action. Commitment 2 ofthe Declaration and chapter II of the Programme ofAction both deal with the goal of poverty eradication. Inthis connection  1997 is a crucial year  being the first yearof the United Nations Decade for the Eradication ofPoverty.By its resolution 50/161  the General Assemblydecided to hold a special session in the year 2000 for anoverall review and appraisal and of the implementation ofthe World Summit for Social Development and toconsider further actions and initiatives. We support theview that  to enable this to happen  the Commissionshould meet annually  that the length of its sessionsshould be extended and that its membership should beincreased.Measures to ensure that women have the samedegree of access as men to economic resources andopportunities are of equal importance for the attainmentof economic progress. Poverty can be eradicated onlythrough the empowerment of the poor. United Nationsefforts should therefore be coordinated in such a mannerthat all its activities for poverty eradication fully take intoaccount the gender perspective.The ratification of the Convention on the Eliminationof All Forms of Discrimination against Women wassupposed to be followed by the revision of all laws thatact as an impediment to the social and economicadvancement of women. In Lesotho this goal  althoughnot yet reached  is still being actively pursued.Lesotho has joined the other countries of southernAfrica in signing two Protocols to the Southern AfricanDevelopment Community (SADC) Treaty recently  one ofwhich deals with politics  defence and security and theother with cooperation in combating transboundary crime especially trafficking in narcotics and money-laundering.A central element of the Protocol establishing anOrgan on Politics  Defence and Security is thecommitment to work for the protection and promotion ofhuman rights in the region. Our endeavours in this regardare intended to reinforce the United Nations ownprogrammes.The increase in crime  particularly transnationalcrime  has a considerable effect on the economies of17many countries. New worldwide strategies are thereforeurgently needed for combating this malaise. However developing countries cannot bear the economic burden ofcombating transnational crime by themselves. Technicalcooperation and assistance activities to develop thecriminal-justice capacities of developing countries shouldtherefore be accorded a high priority.The activities of the Crime Prevention and CriminalJustice Division — particularly its training courses seminars and workshops for criminal-justice personnel —are to be commended.Let me conclude by observing that together we havethe capacity to make the United Nations of the nextcentury a veritable instrument for meeting mankind’saspirations for a better world in all respects. In ourinterdependent world  the United Nations has to becomean efficient working forum for searching for universalconsensus  a conscious regulator of the integrationprocesses and a vehicle for establishing a stable worldorder.We have deep confidence in the potential of the jointefforts of the entire international community in itscapability to enter the twenty-first century in anatmosphere of peace  development and joint creativework  and to provide comprehensive security for all  as iscalled for by the priority interests of humankind."
"101",4236,"LTU",51,1996,"﻿On behalf of the LithuanianGovernment  allow me to warmly congratulate Mr. RazaliIsmail on his election as President of the GeneralAssembly at this session.20This session marks the fifth anniversary of the re-entrance of Lithuania into the international community ofstates. Five years ago  Lithuania was admitted to the UnitedNations. At that time  the Organization  its Member Statesand the peoples of the world saw the chance to seizehistoric opportunities created by the new internationalsituation  with its promise of peace and stability.The past five years leave no doubt that some of theseopportunities have been taken in a positive way. We haveseen that the highest levels of cooperation are possible  bothinternationally and regionally. The destinies of differentpeoples around the world have been linked as never beforeby the globalization of the world economy and theinformation superhighway.But many cross-border issues  such as crime  drugs environmental pollution and terrorism  pose a majorchallenge to us not only as individual nation-States  but asa family of nations as well. These global challenges havefar-reaching implications for the world Organization.Originally  the United Nations was entrusted with thetask of ensuring world harmony. Is it no less vital today tomaintain and promote this worldwide policy  as designed bythe founders of the United Nations? My answer is in thepositive.For this reason  we need an Organization that can bemore responsive to the demands of Member States  andMember States that act responsibly by setting realistic goalsand providing the resources needed for theirimplementation.During these past five years  Lithuania has progressedpolitically and economically. Our relations withneighbouring States are friendly and mutually beneficial thus ensuring a secure and stable environment in the region.We are in the process of becoming integrated into Europeanand transatlantic structures. Negotiations on accession to theWorld Trade Organization are well-advanced  ties with ourneighbours that are members of the Central European FreeTrade Agreement are gaining strength. The most valuablecooperation is being advanced with Nordic countries  theEuropean Union and the North Atlantic Alliance. Thesedimensions of cooperation have been fruitfully applied inother structures as well. Cooperation with the EuropeanUnion on core United Nations issues — humanitarianaffairs  human rights  peacekeeping  structural and financialreforms — and with the North Atlantic Treaty Organizationin the Implementation Force mission is the best example.We are striving to deepen and broaden this cooperation.The global challenges before us require thecommitment of Member States to the goals enshrined inthe United Nations Charter and call for structural andinstitutional reform of the Organization. We have begunthe reform aimed at streamlining the functions of theUnited Nations and rendering its institutional structuremore effective and flexible to deal with tasks whichsometimes cannot be foreseen in advance. We must bearin mind that the future Organization can be only aseffective as its Member States desire it to be.First  it goes without saying that we must put theUnited Nations on a sound financial footing andstrengthen its capacity to fulfil its vital tasks. We supportthe proposals put forward by the European Union in thisregard. A realigned scale of assessments  annual revisionof the scale  phasing out the scheme of limits  loweringthe assessment floor and swift implementation of theproposals in practice would be the tools to overcome thefinancial crisis and would certainly be an incentive forMembers to regularize payments.Lithuania remains committed to its financialobligations to the Organization. We also reiterate ourfundamental belief that the scale of assessments mustreflect the capacity to pay. At a time when manycountries  Lithuania included  are undergoing budgetaryadjustments and reviews  sound management of theresources of the United Nations takes on addedimportance.Secondly  we believe that the functioning of UnitedNations decision-making bodies must be improved. TheSecurity Council makes decisions that are binding on allMember States and influences the lives of millions. It isthus essential to make the Council more representative ofthe world as it is today. More specifically  Lithuania hascalled for increasing the representational capacity of theSecurity Council in both categories of membership. TheGovernment of Lithuania recognizes that developingcountries have a case for improving their representation.We also recognize that some countries  such as Germanyand Japan  can make a special contribution and that theyare ready to assume special political  military andfinancial responsibility as new permanent members. Inour view  due consideration should also be given to theaspirations to an additional non-permanent seat of thecountries of Eastern Europe  whose numbers have tripledin recent years. We hope for agreement on the reform ofthe Security Council. Lithuania supports proposals to thisend and encourages stronger movement by States towardsnegotiations on the implementation of reform.21In terms of a comprehensive reform of the UnitedNations system  any such reform is likely to fail if there isno clear vision of its objectives and of the strategies forpursuing them. A stark reassessment of the mission andmandates is included in the United Nations medium-termplan for 1998-2001. We consider it to be a good basis fordebate on the enhancement of the United Nations and forstrengthening its capacity to face new emerging challenges.Lithuania  striving to make its contribution tointernational cooperation in the maintenance of security andstability  is determined to continue to improve the skills ofits peacekeepers  civilian police monitors and militaryobservers and will offer them to the United Nations in theservice of peacekeeping operations. Lithuania  incooperation with Estonia and Latvia  and also with Poland is advancing the development of joint peacekeeping units an exercise which in itself is a testimony to ultimateunderstanding and cooperation between countries.The costs and scope of United Nations peacekeepingoperations have proliferated dramatically since 1990. Oneof the best ways to reduce this proliferation  and moreparticularly to prevent human suffering  is to implementmany of the proposals put forward by the Secretary-Generalin his “An Agenda for Peace”  especially in terms ofresolving disputes before violence breaks out.United Nations intervention too often comes tooslowly and too late under very difficult circumstances.Lacking resources  the Secretary-General is sometimesexpected to maintain peace where there is no will tomaintain peace. We feel that the emphasis needs to beplaced on strengthening the United Nations system’spreventive capacity. We may need to adopt themultidimensional approach to the concept of security mobilize the United Nations system in order to preventexisting disputes from escalating into conflict  and attackthe problem at its very roots.Lithuania welcomes measures to strengthen the UnitedNations administrative structures in charge of peacekeepingoperations. The experience of the past few years leads us tobelieve that we need to explore non-traditional approachesto conflict prevention and resolution  including theOrganization’s rapid response capability. While the demandin this domain still seems to be more than the UnitedNations is equipped for  the burden-sharing of peacekeepingwith other regional organizations has to prevent the eruptionof a severe crisis. The complexity of the maintenance ofpeace and security should not be solely a United Nationsenterprise. In Europe  we have the Organization forSecurity and Cooperation in Europe  which operates inaccordance with agreed principles and is engaged inactivities to help parties to resolve disputes withoutrecourse to fighting.Lithuania believes that any strategy for preventingarmed conflicts also involves pursuing tangibledisarmament objectives  especially in the areas of nuclearnon-proliferation and the control of conventional arms.The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty nowready for signature can be considered one of the historicdecisions of this decade. Today  I signed the Treaty onbehalf of the Republic of Lithuania. I believe this tangibleachievement of humankind should fuel internationalefforts to take further effective measures towards nucleardisarmament.A major challenge immediately ahead is themaintenance of multilateral disarmament and non-proliferation efforts. We must find a key to freeze theproduction and development of weapons of massdestruction. The adoption of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty should set the tone for the disarmamentprocess which will be accompanied by the Convention onthe Prohibition of the Development  Production Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on TheirDestruction. We must cope with new nuclear challenges such as nuclear leakage  smuggling of fissile materials failures in nuclear-custody systems and the potentialthreat of nuclear terrorism.Moreover  the dangerously widespread use ofconventional weapons undermines all attempts at thepeaceful solution to conflicts. Sometimes  as in the caseof land-mines  the deadly consequences persist for manyyears  causing human suffering and resulting in enormouscosts. The growing support for banning the production ofand trade in anti-personnel land-mines is one way tocorrect this problem.Peace and development are closely linked anddevelopment is a multifaceted process. Revitalization ofthe United Nations in economic  social and related fields and interaction between the United Nations and othermultilateral development institutions  including theBretton Woods institutions and the World TradeOrganization  should be addressed to better structure theOrganization for serving peoples’ development needs.Sustainable development must be based on participatorydemocracy and respect for human rights.22Democratization must take hold inside a State andshould extend to the international community. The processof democratization cannot be separated from the protectionof human rights. We will continue to support UnitedNations programmes aimed at promoting a democraticculture and at consolidating new or re-establisheddemocracies.Humanitarian assistance efforts face the challenge ofresponding to humanitarian crises that have increased bothin number and complexity. United Nations programmescould complement other initiatives already in place andshould be expanded in those fields where collective actionis required  such as in comprehensive reconstruction andrehabilitation of war-ravaged areas.Although the merits of the Office of the UnitedNations High Commissioner for Refugees in facilitatingsolutions to acute migration problems are evident  sometendencies are cause for concern. The internationalcommunity needs updated approaches in resolution andprevention policy. The Conference on Refugees andMigrants in the Commonwealth of Independent States andneighbouring countries  held in Geneva in May 1996  wasa step towards action on a regional level. We hope thatcountries will adhere to the Programme of Action  inparticular those provisions concerning illegal migration.We are in favour of strengthening mechanisms tomonitor and protect human rights  especially in conflictsituations. When these rights are seriously violated despiteall efforts to the contrary  we are in favour of turning tojudicial recourse. For this reason  we support the creationof an international criminal court for the adjudication of allhuman rights violations  wherever they may occur.One of the greatest challenges stymieing the efforts ofthe international community to ensure sustainabledevelopment and democracy is transnational crime. Thisoften takes the form of illicit sales of arms and drugs  illicittrafficking in people  child prostitution and other crimes. Nosingle country is able to cope with well-organized and well-financed criminal structures. We deem that efficient anti-money-laundering measures can be among the best tools toundermine the economic roots of the criminal world.The window of opportunity for greater internationalcooperation is wider than at any time since 1945. We mustseize the moment if international cooperation is to take adecisive step forward. A reformed and streamlined UnitedNations  concentrating on the tasks entrusted to it in theCharter  can make considerable progress towards fulfillingthe high expectations we place in it today."
"102",4280,"LUX",51,1996,"﻿Allow me firstof all to congratulate the President most warmly on hiselection to serve as President of the fifty-first session of theGeneral Assembly.I also wish to convey my thanks to the previousPresident  Mr. Freitas do Amaral  for the commitment  skilland poise with which he led our work at the last session ofthe Assembly.I would also like to convey my appreciation to ourSecretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for hisongoing outstanding work for our Organization sincebeginning of his term.The views of the Luxembourg Government on themajor international issues are the same as those expressedby our European Union partners. They were presented tothe Assembly yesterday morning by Mr. Dick Spring President of the Council and Minister for Foreign Affairsof Ireland.Luxembourg learned with great satisfaction that ourGeneral Assembly  by an overwhelming majority  hadadopted and opened for signature the resolutioncontaining the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.Yesterday  on behalf of the Luxembourg Government  Isigned that document  which marks substantial progresstowards the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and thecreation of a safer and more humane world. I hope thatthe parties concerned will continue to work to create theright conditions for the rapid entry into force of thisTreaty.Also in the area of disarmament  I support withoutreserve the United Nations work on the question of anti-personnel landmines  which day after day  long after theguns have fallen silent in a conflict  continue to claimcountless victims. If there is any evil which must beeradicated  this is it.I rejoice in the significant progress which has beenachieved  in less than a year  in the conflict in the formerYugoslavia. I welcome the holding of elections on 14September  which marks a decisive stage for the future ofBosnia and Herzegovina. Bosnians  Serbs and Croats mustnow organize their cooperation by first setting upcommon institutions.I regard these elections as a first  important step inthe framework of a process of democratization andstabilization that must be carried further. Its success willdepend above all on the Bosnian parties. It will alsodepend on neighbouring countries  in particular Croatiaand the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Lastly  it willdepend on the support of the international community. MyGovernment is in favour of continued internationalcivilian and military action in order to create theenvironment required to preserve peace and prevent areturn to war.Luxembourg is concerned by the check to the peaceprocess in the Middle East that has followed the changeof Government in Israel. We take the view that there is13no alternative to this complex and fragile process: the fruitof arduous negotiations. We urge our friends in Israel topursue this process  to comply with and execute thecommitments undertaken pursuant to the Oslo agreementsand to avoid creating fresh obstacles. We fear that anyother policy may generate further tension and once againtrigger a spiral of violence that would inflict suffering onall the peoples of the region. The alarming events that tookplace on the West Bank today threaten to destroy the resultsof several years of effort to achieve a just and lasting peacein the Middle East.The Luxembourg Government condemns the recentattacks launched by the Government of Saddam Hussein onthe Kurdish population of northern Iraq. It was inevitablethat measures would be taken to react to this freshoffensive. We call for a complete withdrawal of Iraqi forcesand for full respect for the territorial integrity of Iraq. Wehope that the implementation of the “oil-for-food”resolution may take place without delay in order to relievethe hardships suffered by the civilian population of thatcountry.The situation in the Great Lakes region of Africa  inparticular in Burundi  continues to give us the greatestcause for concern. I fully support the efforts of the UnitedNations  in close cooperation with the Organization ofAfrican Unity  to avert both the occurrence in Burundi ofa tragedy such as occurred in Rwanda and a deteriorationof the situation which could plunge the region into war.Over the last year  the United Nations has substantiallycut the number of its peace-keeping operations. Thisreduction in our activities and the set-backs that we havewitnessed in the past should not  however  diminish ourefforts to enhance the United Nations capacity to avert prevent the spread of and halt conflicts  and to save humanlives.It is utterly unfair to criticize the United Nationswhenever a peace-keeping operation runs into difficulties.Many of the shortcomings attributed to the United Nationscould be resolved if all Member States undertook to paytheir contributions to our Organization and  especially make available to it the resources that it needs. For thisreason  Luxembourg supports the ongoing work andreflection aimed at equipping the Organization with a rapid-intervention force that would enable it to react to crises ina timely fashion. Where non-military means have failed  itshould be possible to deploy well-trained and properlyequipped peace-keeping contingents in the field verypromptly in order to give practical effect to the SecurityCouncil’s decisions.Greater responsibility should henceforth be given toregional organizations. The Organization for Security andCooperation in Europe (OSCE) is nowadays playing aleading role in conflict management in Europe and theCaucasus. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization(NATO) in the former Yugoslavia and the Organizationof African Unity (OAU) in the Great Lakes region aredoing the same. Other regional and subregionalorganizations in Africa  Latin America and elsewhere areperforming similar tasks with the support of the UnitedNations.International security begins with the security of theindividual  with respect for his fundamental rights and hisprotection against any violation of those rights  includingthe actions of his own Government. Nothing  therefore can justify violations of human rights  which by their verynature have universal value. Our Organization plays animportant role in developing international machinerydesigned to provide effective protection for human rights.This role takes the form  among others  of the efforts tocarry out systematic investigations and enquiries with aview to sanctioning those responsible for violations ofinternational humanitarian law and human rights.Luxembourg supports the early creation of aninternational criminal court  which would be a decisivestep forward in ensuring respect for the principles ofinternational law.Among the most vulnerable human beings are ourchildren  and they therefore deserve special protection.The adoption of the Convention on the Rights of theChild marks a major advance. Scrupulously applied  thatConvention will be an invaluable instrument insafeguarding children against physical and psychologicalviolence. In 1995 my Government proposed to the UnitedNations a similar  indeed  a complementary initiative  toeliminate the exploitation of child labour. I welcome thisAssembly adoption of that proposal designed to come tothe aid of the tens of millions of children forced to workfrom an early age. This effort should be strengthened andfurther pursued. Luxembourg also hails the results of theStockholm World Congress on the Commercial SexualExploitation of Children. My Government is resolved tofoster international cooperation in the prevention andsuppression of sexual exploitation of children in order toeffectively protect and safeguard children at theinternational level against such criminal practices.14The globalization of the world economy is bringingabout profound changes in international relations. Averitable revolution in information and communicationtechnologies reducing geographic distances to nothing hasled to a speeding up of business transactions and financialflows  as well as increased integration of markets.Generally accepted ideas have been turned upside down and serious questions have been raised even amongindustrialized countries  where unemployment has grown toalarming proportions.At the same time  we note that a significant number ofdeveloping countries remain on the sidelines ofdevelopment and remain in great poverty. At a time whenour Organization proclaimed 1996 International Year for theEradication of Poverty  more than 1.5 billion human beingscontinue to live in a state of absolute poverty. We cannotremain indifferent to this situation. What should particularlydisturb us is the inequality gap  which is widening bothwithin countries and between the countries of the North andthe South. This is a dangerous source of new tensions andconflicts.The United Nations Development Programme’s latestreport on human development speaks of worldwide socialfragmentation. It underscores the widening disparitiesbetween rich and poor States and increased imbalances insocieties between inhabitants of the same country. Thepopulation explosion and uneven access to the fruits oftechnological progress further compound these distortions.This trend is likely to trigger increasingly massivemigrations within countries and from poor countries toricher ones.In order to remedy this situation  I propose to developa new strategy based on four main courses of action. First we should provide follow-up to  and translate intooperational activities  the results of the major conferencesheld since the beginning of this decade in Rio  Vienna Cairo  Copenhagen  Beijing and  most recently  in Istanbul.The World Food Summit scheduled by the Food andAgriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) forNovember and the special session on sustainabledevelopment in the spring of 1997 are also opportunities todefine an integrated programme of action to foster humandevelopment.Secondly  we must halt the persistent decline of fundsmade available for development  a symptom of “donorfatigue”. In each of our countries we must launch a newmovement of solidarity to benefit the poorest and leastdeveloped countries. The Government of Luxembourg hasdecided to increase year by year its contribution tocooperation for development. Our intention is to achievethe target of devoting 0.7 per cent of our gross nationalproduct to official development assistance before the endof this decade. A significant portion of these funds willbe made available to the various funds and programmesof the United Nations system. This is not simply aquestion of solidarity and social justice on a world scale;it is  above all  a preventive policy designed to contribute however modestly  to peace by encouraging development.The third main course of action is to strengthen theUnited Nations capacity to act in the economic and socialfield. That strengthening requires courageous reforms ofits structures. Above and beyond the proposals of theSummit of major industrialized countries at Lyon  whichI welcome  I advocate a single rigorous coordinationstructure for all economic and social activities and especially  a concerted restructuring of the bodies andmandates concerned. In this context  I note with interest the proposal of the XX Congress of the SocialistInternational  which took place recently in this verybuilding  calling for the setting up of integrated economicinstitutions on the regional and international levels and forthe setting up of a United Nations economic securitycouncil.Fourthly  we must develop cooperation with therepresentatives of organized civil society  which is to say the non-governmental organizations.The participation ofnon-governmental organizations in internationalorganizations reinforces  in a sense  the politicallegitimacy of those international bodies. Therepresentatives of civil society nowadays play a key rolein the activities of the United Nations system  whether inthe promotion of human rights and democracy  inhumanitarian assistance or in cooperation fordevelopment. They make an invaluable contribution notonly to the Organization’s operational activities but alsoto its thinking processes  as attested to by the significantparticipation of non-governmental organizations in thepreparation  holding and follow-up of the major worldconferences organized by the United Nations.This new dimension of our work was alsohighlighted at the congress of the World Federation ofUnited Nations Associations  whose fiftieth-anniversarymeeting  I am proud to note  was held in Luxembourg alittle over a month ago.The financial situation of our Organization continuesto be a matter of grave concern. As of July  the United15Nations cash flow was exhausted  and this situation canonly worsen between now and the end of the year.Any attempt at a radical reform of the system will befutile if we continue to neglect the fundamental need to putit on an adequate and reliable financial footing. The UnitedNations cannot discharge its important responsibilitieseffectively if it is reduced to constant worry about makingends meet.Admittedly  the Organization could do even more tocontrol its expenditure and enhance its effectiveness.Greater attention should be given  inter alia  to the questionof establishing each State’s assessed contribution  whichshould be based on objective criteria and reflect eachcountry’s real ability to pay. However  the crisis will beovercome only if each Member State fulfils its obligationsby making full  timely and unconditional payment of itsfinancial contribution. I therefore unreservedly support theproposals made by the European Union in this regard.In the ongoing reform process  one aspect is ofparticular significance. Within our Organization  theSecurity Council bears unique responsibilities as the organentrusted with preventing and resolving conflicts.One of thegreatest lessons to be learnt from the experiences andsetbacks of recent years is that Security Council membersmust  if they wish to preserve its credibility  demonstratetheir determination to enforce their decisions  once taken.The credibility and effectiveness of the Council withregard to peace-keeping and international security will bereinforced by the establishment of more open  transparentand collegial decision-making processes while maintainingclose consultation with the countries supplying matériel andcontingents. The not-insignificant progress made in thisrespect in the recent past should be integrated into thesystem.In addition  the Council’s legitimacy  and probably thequality of its decisions  would also benefit from areadjustment in membership. The enlargement of theCouncil should take into account the ability of memberStates to contribute to peace-keeping and to theachievement of the Organization’s goals. A better balancemust be struck between industrialized and developingcountries.The passing of the bipolar world has freed our planetfrom the ideological  political and military fetters thatimpeded to an extraordinary degree our capacity to act.Relieved of the threat of global confrontation and nuclearholocaust  we are now faced with a series of worldwideproblems  old and new  that includes underdevelopment environmental degradation  the proliferation of all kindsof weapons  terrorism  ethnic conflicts  drug trafficking violence and crime in all its guises.Luxembourg is convinced that the solution to thoseproblems lies not in isolationism  nor in nationalism  norin fundamentalism of any description. We would also bedeluding ourselves were we to put our trust solely in themarket and private initiative to remedy all humanity’s ills.Only through an approach based on cooperation solidarity  tolerance and mutual esteem can we tacklethose problems successfully at both the regional and theworld levels.This has been the approach of the European Unionand its member States  which have succeeded in attaining in Europe  a level of stability and prosperity hithertounknown. The approach is based on the concept ofdemocracy and of a market economy that is notuncontrolled but socially responsible  one in which theState fully shoulders its responsibilities in the areas ofhealth  education and social justice. The system requiresconstant adjustments  but its principles and bases are notsubject to debate. Other parts of the world have alsosuccessfully entered into a process of cooperation andregional integration.On the world level  the United Nations is the onlytruly universal Organization. We must work at this levelto make a contribution vital to the solution of globalproblems  one that will complement the efforts beingmade at the regional level.That is the new and important responsibility thatbecame evident in the course of the events and meetingsthat occurred the world over in commemorating thefiftieth anniversary of the United Nations last year. Therewas emphasis on the need to set up new structures and toreform the United Nations  to give it the requisite capacityfor review  action and cooperation.It is our hope that  with a heightened awareness ofthe interests of all mankind we  the representatives of theStates Members of the United Nations  will succeed indisplaying the vision  courage and political resolve neededto make our Organization an effective instrument capableof facing the challenges of the third millennium."
"103",4306,"LVA",51,1996,"﻿Allow me to congratulate you  Sir on your election and to wish you success in carrying outyour duties during the fifty-first session of the GeneralAssembly. I wish all of us a productive and fruitful sessionof the General Assembly and assure members of the fullcooperation of the delegation of Latvia in ensuring thesuccess of their work.“Reform” was a much-used word during the previoussession of this body. The word “crisis” may become just asprevalent during the fifty-first session. In this connection I should like to recall the words of United States PresidentJohn Fitzgerald Kennedy:“When written in Chinese  the word crisis' iscomposed of two characters. One represents dangerand the other represents opportunity.”Since joining the United Nations five years ago  Latviahas consistently supported reforms so as to avoid crises.Our 50-year absence from the international communitymakes us especially appreciate the fact that this rostrum isthe one place in the world from which all nations can speakwith an equal voice about matters of global importance.A statement from this rostrum is a means rather thanan end. It can be but the first of many steps to a level ofhuman development that Immanuel Kant characterized aseternal peace. Too often the closest we come to attainingthe ideal of a world without wars and the United Nations asthe maintainer of international peace and security is theestablishment of the mechanisms needed to halt armedconflict. In this connection  may I recall that the jointEstonian-Latvian-Lithuanian peacekeeping battalion  whosetraining period will conclude next year  will be acontribution of the Baltic States to the strengthening ofthe mechanisms for peacekeeping and peacemakingestablished by the United Nations.The current world situation forces us to questionhow often we have been too late  how often we have beenfound lacking in wisdom  foresight and effectivediplomacy in our attempts to resolve disputes peacefully.Somalia  former Yugoslavia  Chechnya  Rwanda — theseare not the only areas that have suffered recently. Theseare problems for the entire global community  not onlythe United Nations. It makes us think how far we arefrom the ideal of eternal world peace  which few believepossible  but whose realization is one of the fundamentalpurposes of the United Nations. We all agree that peaceis a fundamental value and that war means catastropheand destruction. Still  we live in a world in which armedconflicts constantly arise; where some profit from war;and where relationships of dominance  the rules of thegame  and differing values do not exclude war as amechanism for pursuing national interests.Reducing the possibility of local conflicts is animportant aspect of global security. Any local armedconflict affects the global society as a whole  especiallyin our rapidly changing and shrinking world  in which thenotions of distance  speed and information change rapidly.International terrorism  the illegal trade in weapons andnarcotics  people fleeing their homes and otherconsequences accompany local conflicts  but do not limitthemselves to the conflict zone alone. Political instabilityand racial  religious and ethnic discord  combined withlow standards of living  breed armed conflicts. Aspreventive measures  the United Nations must continue topromote actively a respect for human rights  tolerance  theuniversality of the United Nations  disarmament and theimplementation of arms-control agreements  and supportthe economies of States that may need assistance.We hail the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty(CTBT)  which has opened for signature and ratificationafter a long and difficult search for compromise. I intendto sign the CTBT today. We are convinced that thisTreaty can move the world closer to peace. Latviaconsiders it imperative that work be continued on thecontrol of conventional weapons. We support thechemical weapons Convention  even though we areconcerned that the two largest producers of chemicalweapons have not yet ratified the Convention.5Latvia believes that universal respect for human rightsshould continue to be a priority of the United Nations andits Members. Taking into account the ever-increasing tasksof the United Nations human rights system  increasedallocation of resources devoted to United Nations humanrights activities is an absolute necessity. Double standardson human rights are intolerable  and Latvia devotesparticular attention to this. The guidelines for the globalprotection of human rights are the documents adopted at theWorld Conference on Human Rights. Countries shouldimplement these guidelines and share with others theirexperience in doing so.In Latvia these guidelines have been applied to aunique demographic situation caused by 50 years ofoccupation. In accordance with a recommendation of theWorld Conference on Human Rights  Latvia has establishedan independent institution for the protection of humanrights: the State Human Rights Office. This office has amandate to hear and investigate complaints from Latvia’sresidents  inform members of society about human rights and make recommendations to the Government andParliament on legislation affecting human rights. Inestablishing the State Human Rights Office  Latvia receivedinvaluable assistance from the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme  the High Commissioner for Human Rights andthe Centre for Human Rights.The United Nations must continue to protect thosevalues that engender a respect for human rights  tolerance the rejection of violence and the promotion of peace. It isnot weapons or physical force that protect homes  peopleand countries. Rather  true security depends  inter alia  ongood relations with all neighbours and on a strongeconomy. Latvia is successfully implementing such apolicy. Our aim is to achieve rapid economic growth and toattract foreign investment in Latvia. Already this year Latvia has one of the lowest rates of inflation in EasternEurope  along with a stable currency and rapidly risingindexes of development. We have a well developed portsystem  including the world’s second largest potassium-salts-loading harbour and one of Europe’s largest harboursfor the transit of petroleum products.Latvia is the geographical centre of the Baltic Statesand is a natural economic bridge between East and West.Our country belongs to the European family of democraticStates  sharing common values and cooperating for theirprotection. Integration in the European and transatlanticstructures is the highest priority for Latvia. We are activelyworking for the integration of Latvia into the European andglobal economic systems  as well as for a close partnershipin the European continent  on both the governmental andnon-governmental levels.Latvia is also participating in efforts to improve thework of the United Nations so that the Organization canreact more effectively to the challenges of our time. Insupport of the restructuring and revitalization of theUnited Nations in the economic  social and related fields and in recognition of the desirability of frequent rotationof Member States represented on important UnitedNations bodies  Latvia has for the first time everpresented its candidature for a seat on the Economic andSocial Council beginning in 1997.A year has passed since the United Nationscelebrated its fiftieth anniversary  when much was heardabout the urgency of reform of the Organization. Yetduring the last year Member States have been unable toagree on these long-awaited reforms. If Member Statescontinue not to make decisions  the United Nations willslowly but inevitably lose its ability to pursue its globalgoals effectively. As part of the reform efforts  it isimportant that the United Nations periodically enunciateand evaluate priorities to be pursued  in particular intimes when resources are limited but the demand for themis growing.One cause of the crisis facing the United Nations isthe financial situation. Each Member State's financialcontribution to the Organization must reflect its capacityto pay. Contributions can be a great burden fordeveloping countries and countries with economies intransition that are overassessed. A future system ofcontributions must be fair  transparent and elastic in orderthat it may readily adapt to economic changes.Latvia would like to repeat its view that new andinnovative financing mechanisms are a necessity. Itsupports the current effort of the Economic and SocialCouncil to study such mechanisms for the purpose offinancing development that is sustainable. Theintroduction of new financing mechanisms and otherfinancial management tools can only improve thecurrently weak financial discipline of Member States.Latvia supports reforms that would result in thereduction of the number of subsidiary bodies of theGeneral Assembly and the number of administrativestructures in the Secretariat  as well as a full introductionof methods of modern management.6With regard to the reform of the Security Council  apriority should be to adjust its membership in order toachieve equitable geographic representation and to respondto the increase in the membership of the United Nations inrecent decades. The effectiveness of the work of theSecurity Council must be increased further by making itsworking methods even more transparent and the exchangeof information with non-members more intense than atpresent.Latvia is a country that is attached to the ideals ofpeace  democracy and human rights. It identifies itself withthe efforts of the global society to maintain and realizethese ideals. It is an active member of the community ofnations. This  we are convinced  is the genuine road tosecurity and social and economic prosperity for our countryand for the world."
"104",4353,"MAR",51,1996,"﻿At the outset I would like  on behalf of my country  tocongratulate the President sincerely  and the friendlycountry of Malaysia  on his election to preside over theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-first session. Hiscompetence and profound knowledge of internationalaffairs will clearly contribute to the achievement of theexpected results of the session. I should like to take thisopportunity to assure him that the delegation of theKingdom of Morocco will provide its full support andassistance in order to achieve those results.I would also like to express my deep appreciation toMr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral for the wisdom with whichhe guided the proceedings of the fiftieth session and forhis commendable efforts in connection with thecommemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the UnitedNations.Although the cold war ended a few years ago  anddespite the hopes of the peoples of the world that a newinternational era would dawn in which they could reap thebenefits and dividends of peace and take part on an equalfooting in the guidance and management of internationalaffairs in order to preserve their ideals  values andinterests  we note that the current world situation ischaracterized by instability and confusion and is far fromreflecting the order we so hoped to achieve. Indeed  farfrom bringing peace  security and justice  the end of thecold war spawned a situation in which local crises havebrought suffering to millions of people in several regionsof the world  severely stirring our global conscience.These crises have also highlighted the inability of theinternational community to devise effective mechanismsto resolve such conflicts in an equitable way and to putan end to the tragedies they engender.Morocco believes that the Secretary-General’sinitiative for restructuring the United Nations andstrengthening its role falls precisely within thisperspective and can prepare the Organization to deal withthe effects of these conflicts through preventivediplomacy  the development and reform of United Nationsbodies  and coordination between the United Nations andother international and regional organizations. We are moreover  convinced that the re-election of Mr. BoutrosBoutros-Ghali to a second term as Secretary-Generalwould be the best guarantee for the continuation of thosereforms. The Secretary-General’s experience  competence 15courage and spirit of initiative in settling internationalconflicts and reactivating international cooperation invarious fields  make him the best choice to guide the affairsof the Organization during a second mandate. Morocco alsohopes that any controversy on the subject will be avoidedin order to forestall adverse repercussions on the work ofthis session and on the future of the Organization.The commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of ourOrganization provided an opportunity for the numerousHeads of State who attended the celebration to expressconcerns and apprehensions regarding the challengesconfronting us. They issued a Declaration that containedtheir proposals and recommendations for meeting thosechallenges and devising effective mechanisms to promotecloser relations among countries. In our view  this sessionprovides us an opportunity to reflect on thoserecommendations and proposals and to find answers to thequestions raised by the Heads of State regarding thefundamental and structural reforms of the United Nations.With regard to the Security Council and itsprerogatives in discharging its mandate to maintaininternational peace and security  we believe that anyinitiative aimed at expanding the membership of theSecurity Council and improving its modes of action wouldrequire much thought and circumspection. It must take intoaccount current realities if any final decision in this regardis to lead to the desired reform and thereby guaranteeequitable representation of all continents. The aim here isto ensure the Council’s efficiency and credibility and toenhance its ability to cope with any violation ofinternational law without impinging on the prerogatives androle of the General Assembly.However  any reform that does not take into accountthe current financial difficulties of the Organization clearlycannot produce the expected results. It will be extremelydifficult for the United Nations to fulfil its mission withouta stable financial base. Hence the need for all MemberStates to pay their contributions  settle their arrears andthereby give concrete substance to their collective andcontinued support for the efforts of the Organization.In the field of disarmament  many important stepshave been taken in the control of weapons of massdestruction  including nuclear weapons. Following theestablishment of nuclear-free zones in Latin America andthe South Pacific and the indefinite extension of the Treatyon the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  the Africancountries signed a Treaty making Africa a nuclear-freecontinent. In addition to these achievements  we hope to seethe Middle East also become a zone free of weapons ofmass destruction and of nuclear weapons in particular.Moreover  following the success of the efforts toproduce the final version  the Comprehensive NuclearTest-Ban Treaty will be open for signature tomorrow.Morocco  which made an important contribution to thedrafting of the Treaty  is convinced that this documentwill open the way for the complete elimination of nuclearweapons  strengthen international cooperation andpromote the exchange of knowledge about the peacefuluses of nuclear energy  so that developing countries canachieve their economic and technical goals.Morocco’s interest in this subject is predicated on itsacute awareness of the risks involved and that armscontrol is the cornerstone of any initiative aimed at firmlyestablishing the basis for international peace and securitythroughout the world. Humanity can be sheltered from thetragedy of massively destructive wars only through thefull and complete elimination of nuclear  chemical andbiological weapons under effective international control.Last year  I told this Assembly that the efforts of theKingdom of Morocco to achieve territorial integrity hadgone through a series of phases unique in the history ofthe independence of nations. The time has come forMorocco to recover all its territories.Being fully committed to peace and to the settlementof problems through dialogue  and having continuallydefended this principle in international forums as a meansfor resolving problems between nations  Morocco isconvinced that the return of the cities of Ceuta andMelilla and of the neighbouring islands still underSpanish occupation can only occur through those samemeans. This is particularly true given the commoninterests and the well-established and good-neighbourlyrelations existing between Morocco and Spain. This is moreover  precisely what His Majesty King Hassan IItook the initiative to underscore when he called for theestablishment of a Moroccan-Spanish think tankdefinitively to resolve this question.Accordingly  the final  complete solution we areadvocating is one which preserves Moroccan sovereigntyon the territories it holds  while guaranteeing Spanishinterests. This would further consolidate the dynamics ofthe diverse and close cooperation between the northernand southern shores of the Mediterranean. We are alsoconvinced that our age-old relations with neighbouring16Spain will be instrumental in finding a permanent solutionto this question.The developments in the Middle East over the pastfew years opened prospects of tolerance and coexistence forthe peoples of the region  instead of dissension and fighting.We view the progress that has been made as an auspicioussign in that regard  starting with the Madrid Conference andthe Oslo agreements and progressing to thePalestinian-Israeli agreement and the Jordanian-Israeliagreement.Morocco has contributed to giving life to the conceptof peace in the region  and has made tireless efforts toestablish a comprehensive  just and lasting peace that wouldguarantee the return of all occupied Arab territories including Al-Quds al-Sharif  the occupied Syrian GolanHeights and southern Lebanon in keeping with SecurityCouncil resolutions 242 (1967)  338 (1973) and 425 (1978)and the principle of land for peace. We therefore regret theinterruption of the peace process  which threatens to destroyall the efforts we have made to establish security andstability in the region.We have the right to wonder whether the principlesand commitments agreed upon at the Madrid Conference which provided the groundwork for the process towardsestablishing a just and comprehensive peace in the region have become outdated  not to say null and void. Has thenew Israeli Government  which seeks to cast doubt on thoseprinciples and commitments  realized the disastrousconsequences of such a course of action  which could takethe region and its peoples back to a situation we thoughtwas behind us thanks to an irreversible commitment and anew perception of the region’s future?We believe in peace and are dedicated to its defenceand maintenance as an irreversible option and goal. Mycountry has contributed to this mission of its own free willand in good faith. Similarly  we have on many occasionspointed out that genuine security for all the countries of theregion can be achieved only through the establishment of acomprehensive  just and lasting peace which guarantees therights of all parties in the region.In this respect  we call for scrupulous and unequivocalcommitment  with no delays  to all that has been agreedupon  in order to implement the agreements reachedaccording to the scheduled phases of the peace process. Wealso call for removing the obstacles impeding the bilateralArab-Israeli negotiations so that we may keep abreast of thesubstantial progress made in the multilateral peace processin order to achieve the desired final solution.The blockade imposed on the Palestinian territories which hinders even the delivery of international assistanceto the Palestinian people  makes it particularly difficultfor the Palestinian Authority to discharge its obligationsto its people  who are living in extremely difficultconditions. In addition  the colonization policy applied byIsrael and the changes it is introducing in the old part ofthe city of Al-Quds and neighbouring areas constitute aviolation of the United Nations resolutions  principles andcommitments to which I referred earlier.In this respect  we call for a lifting of this blockadeand for providing full material support and assistance tothe Palestinian Authority  in accordance with the decisionstaken by the international community  so that theAuthority can discharge its mission in the best possibleconditions and launch the process of the economicdevelopment of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip inorder to enable the Palestinian people to establish theirindependent State  with Al-Quds as its capital  and tocontribute  on equal footing  to the progress  cooperationand prosperity of the region.The Gulf crisis has long cast a dark shadow on theregion and created crisis conditions. We have repeatedlycalled for transcending these conditions through theimplementation of internationally binding resolutionswithin the framework of ensuring the security andstability of the region and preserving the sovereignty andterritorial integrity of the countries of the region. We areconvinced that this situation cannot continue indefinitely.The prospects for an easing of the crisis arebeginning to emerge  based on the progress made in theimplementation of Security Council resolutions  and theunderstanding reached by Iraq and the United Nations onthe implementation of resolution 986 (1995)  known asthe oil-for-food resolution. We regret the latestdevelopments in the Gulf region  which are likely to onceagain plunge that area into a spiral of instability andpostpone the implementation of that resolution. As we callfor restraint and calm in order to avoid any escalation  wereaffirm the need to respect Iraq’s sovereignty andterritorial integrity and to implement Security Councilresolution 986 (1995)  in order to alleviate the hardshipsof the Iraqi people  who are still suffering from theembargo which has been imposed on them for the last sixyears.17The problem of the United Arab Emirate islands of theGreater and the Lesser Tunbs and Abu Musa has not yetbeen resolved. Given the relationship of kinship andbrotherhood between us and the United Arab Emirates  andgiven our historic and brotherly relations with Iran  we callupon the two neighbouring countries to find a definitivesolution to this crisis on the basis of respect for thesovereignty of the United Arab Emirates over its islandsand respect for its territorial integrity  in keeping with therelations of neighbourliness and the traditional ties existingbetween the two countries. These ties should be exploitedto the benefit of the peoples of the Emirates and Iran andto achieve stability in the region.Morocco attaches special importance to the conflictbetween Libya and certain Western countries because of itsrepercussions on international and regional relations. In thisconnection  we regretfully note the implications of themeasures imposed on Libya and their extensive damagingeffects on the Libyan people and on the economies ofneighbouring countries. The continuation of this situationhas been a source of concern.Morocco  which is interested in seeing this problemsettled amicably  calls for a favourable response to theinitiatives and efforts made by the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya the Arab League  the Non-Aligned Movement and theOrganization of the Islamic Conference to find a solution tothis crisis.The world has followed with very keen interest theinternational efforts aimed at restoring peace in Bosnia andHerzegovina. These efforts have rekindled hope andprovided an opportunity to put an end to the conflict in theregion and to the crimes against humanity that have claimedtens of thousands of Bosnian lives. Morocco fully supportsthe Bosnian people and their just cause  including thepreservation of their sovereignty  territorial integrity andidentity  and has never hesitated  in its current capacity asChairman of the Organization of the Islamic Conference  toshoulder its responsibilities to help the Bosnian peopleovercome their ordeal. Thus  we worked to set up acoordination mechanism between the Islamic Contact Groupand the International Contact Group  which contributed tobringing about the official signing  at the Paris Conference of the Dayton Agreement  which aims at putting an end tothe bloodshed in the region  finding a comprehensive  justand lasting solution  instilling respect for internationallegality  and contributing to stability in the region. Mycountry has also met its international obligations through itsparticipation in the Implementation Force  therebycontributing to the establishment of security and stabilityin that region.We are gratified to note the substantial progressmade in the implementation of the military aspects of theDayton Agreement and the launching of the constructionof political institutions in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Wehope that the legislative elections held recently willconstitute yet another constructive step towards preservingthe territorial integrity and political unity of the Republicof Bosnia and Herzegovina and achieving harmony andconcord among the country’s various constituents in orderto secure its stability and development.The current world economic situation clearly revealsthe wide gap between developed and developingcountries  as well as the increasing marginalization of thelatter in the international economic arena. This unbalancedsituation threatens to lead to conflicts among countriesarising out of economic and development considerationsand could thus adversely affect world stability.Given the staggering increase in external debt and itsnegative repercussions on the economies of thedeveloping countries  there is an urgent need today to findadequate solutions to this situation  which is mortgagingthe future of the developing countries. Such solutions canbe achieved only through the creation of conditions moreconducive to increasing equal opportunities among thecountries of the world and a genuine partnership that canpave the way towards the achievement of balanced andlasting development.In this context  we once again welcome the initiativeof the United Nations Secretary-General in the “Agendafor Development”. We hope that it will lead to positiveresults  redress the imbalance and help to achieve theeconomic development sought by the developingcountries.The changes affecting the international economicscene following the crystallization of the concept ofeconomic globalization and the liberalization of trade-mandate corrective measures require that the existingdisproportion be corrected  particularly since thebehaviour of certain developed countries in tradeliberalization is still marked by a selective approach.Moreover  protectionist measures and the institution ofcovert barriers in the guise of various environmental andother considerations are inconsistent with the desirablepolicy of liberalization of international trade.18We hope that the task of redressing these imbalanceswill feature prominently among the concerns of the WorldTrade Organization in the near future and that a balancemay be struck between freedom of trade and developmentrequirements.If a solution is to be found  the role of internationalfinancial institutions must be extensively reassessed in viewof the deep changes affecting the international scene.Accordingly  we call for the implementation of theprovisions of World Trade Organization agreements and forcareful thought to be given to defining the concepts ofglobalization that now determine the very future of nations peoples and  indeed  entire continents. This could be doneby means of financial and economic transactions designedto close the gap between countries and to overcome themarginalization from which many of them suffer particularly in Africa.We keenly hope that the meeting of the World TradeOrganization at Singapore in December will provide anopportunity to assess the situation and to enter into a morecareful consideration of the consistency of economic financial and monetary policies  for which Morocco hasbeen calling for some time.The deterioration in the situation on the Africancontinent is most certainly at the forefront of issuesdemanding a joint effort on the part of the internationalcommunity. Effective and practical solutions must be foundfor the serious economic  social and humanitarian problemsfacing African States  which have been compounded bytragedies such as civil war  the spread of epidemics anddeadly diseases  desertification  refugee problems and allthey entail.Morocco  as a country on the African continent thatenjoys deep-rooted historical and other ties with otherAfrican States  takes a keen interest in the continent’sproblems. Bearing in mind those ancient ties and ourspecial political relations  my country has contributed within the means available to it  to the development ofAfrica through the establishment of bilateral cultural andtechnical cooperation with the States of the continent.Morocco will therefore spare no effort to develop andconsolidate bilateral cooperation with African States to helpthe African continent overcome its problems and emergefrom marginalization.During the Marrakesh Ministerial Meeting of theUruguay Round in 1994  His Majesty King Hassan II wasthe first to call for the introduction of a “Marshall Plan”for Africa and to stress the need for greater internationalefforts to help African States develop their economies andbecome integrated into the world economy.In this framework  we welcome the United NationsSystem-wide Special Initiative on Africa. In our opinion we should do our utmost to help this Initiative succeed byensuring that both the United Nations and theinternational community provide the necessary financialand technical support.With regard to what is known as the question ofWestern Sahara  I would like to affirm  as I have donemany times before  Morocco’s commitment andunswerving willingness to implement the United NationsSettlement Plan which guarantees the right of all peoplefrom the Sahara to express their will through areferendum.It has now become clear to everyone that since theend of last year  the United Nations Plan has reached adeadlock. We hope that this stalemate will end as soon aspossible so that the Settlement Plan can be carried out onthe basis of a referendum.As the twenty-first century comes into view  theworld hopes that tomorrow will bring a brighter futurecharacterized by peace  cooperation and brotherhoodamong peoples. As we stand on the threshold of a newcentury  we need to strengthen the United Nations andconsolidate its capabilities so that it can keep up with thechanges taking place and respond to people’s desire forsecurity  justice and development."
"105",4377,"MCO",51,1996,"﻿It is agreat pleasure for me  at this fifty-first session of theGeneral Assembly  to congratulate you on your election.Your wealth of experience in international affairs  yourprofessional skills and your great diplomatic qualities are for me and my country  a guarantee that our work will besuccessful. I would like to include in these very sincerecongratulations the other officers of the Assembly  whomwe have just elected. I wish them all every success in theimportant and delicate tasks that lie ahead.I should also like express our gratitude to andadmiration for the President of the fiftieth session of theGeneral Assembly  whose very successful term of officehas just come to an end. He did sterling work in ensuringthe prestige of the numerous and highly symbolic eventsthat marked the fiftieth anniversary of this Organization.He gave great impetus to the extensive discussions withinthe General Assembly on strengthening the UnitedNations system and on the question of equitablerepresentation on the and increase in the membership ofthe Security Council and other matters related to theCouncil. Suggestions were made by the delegation ofMonaco with regard  notably  to the increase in thenumber of permanent and non-permanent members of theCouncil. They appear in annex 11 of the report of theworking group established to that end.I should also like to take this opportunity to thankthe Secretary-General for his efforts to make ourOrganization less costly and more effective. In aparticularly difficult political and economic situation  hehas never failed in the mission we entrusted to him fiveyears ago.I referred just now to the difficulties of our times.These are major difficulties and often seeminsurmountable  at least in the short term.Many factors  sometimes very different but broadlyconnected  exacerbate these difficulties. The major worldconferences on population and development  on socialdevelopment and on human settlements clearly broughtthese factors to light.If the sustainable and harmonious development weaspire to is to apply to all human beings  we must also tryto preserve the resources of our planet so that futuregenerations do not find themselves totally destitute oneday. In a vital area for us  the Principality of Monaco hasbeen striving for nearly a century to promote thepreservation of oceans and seas and the pricelessresources they provide  through studies and research  butalso by taking specific national and internationalinitiatives. Accordingly  Monaco ratified the UnitedNations Convention on the Law of the Sea and intends in71998 to play an active role  commensurate with our sizeand resources  during the International Year of the Ocean.The General Assembly  five years after the UnitedNations Conference on Environment and Development wisely decided pursuant to resolution 50/113 to hold aspecial session to consider and review the implementationof Agenda 21. This will be an extremely important session.We hope it will give us an opportunity to reinforce theobjectives spelt out at Rio de Janeiro in June 1992.The Principality of Monaco is pleased to host nextyear’s seventh session of the High-Level Advisory Boardon Sustainable Development and then the InternationalWhaling Commission.My country is thus showing our interest in theinternational cooperation which is essential if we are toaddress the confrontation between legitimate economicdevelopment and protection of the environment and thenon-renewal natural resources of our planet.Other major concerns which seriously impededevelopment remain. No continent is spared the tensionsfelt around the world  which pose a serious threat.Our Organization does not always have the meansneeded to face up to these challenges and to the mostalarming situations. Nevertheless  we welcomed theadoption of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty which is finally open for signature and which I will havethe honour to sign during this session on behalf of thePrincipality of Monaco.Might I refer here to the major role played by theInternational Atomic Energy Agency which so ably and socarefully monitors compliance with the safeguardsagreements concluded in the framework of the Treaty onthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  which thePrincipality of Monaco has ratified. Together with this  theAgency very scrupulously seeks to apply  sometimes invery delicate circumstances  the decisions of the SecurityCouncil in this respect. Its responsibilities in the field ofdisarmament are very substantial. Monaco is thereforeparticularly proud to be the home of the MarineEnvironment Laboratory  which functions with theassistance of the United Nations Environment Programmeand the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission.Furthermore  my delegation has been following very closelythe follow-up to resolution 50/75  of which ourPrincipality was one of the sponsors  and which theGeneral Assembly adopted on 12 December 1995.The strengthening of security and cooperation in theMediterranean is of concern to us  as it is of concern toneighbouring friendly countries on both sides of the Sea.The Secretary-General has embarked on valuableconsultations in this respect  and for this we thank himvery sincerely.When wars break out  once the weapons have fallensilent  the painful aftermath remains  including millions oflandmines  which have a devastating  extremely deadlyeffect  scattered in fields and under roads and have amassive impact on civilian populations  primarily onchildren. At the human level  the proliferation of thesedevices causes serious  often incurable  mutilation andmajor material damage. The Security Council’s 15 August1996 discussions on demining in the context of peace-keeping operations highlighted  if there were any need todo so  the importance that the United Nations and themajor Powers attach to this question. His SereneHighness  the Sovereign Prince of Monaco  my father  isno less mindful of this. He has requested his Governmentto provide regular financial assistance to deminingoperations by contributing to the fund set up by theUnited Nations for that purpose. Without offering animmediate  complete solution  a moratorium — or  evenbetter  cessation — on the production and export of theseanti-personnel landmines would give us some hope.This year saw the holding of the twenty-sixthOlympic Games. Men and women from 197 countries andterritories  from very different backgrounds  came togetherand tested their strength. They fought peacefully and  withmutual respect and esteem  created imperishable bonds. Iwas there as Chairman of the Monaco OlympicCommittee and as a member of the International OlympicCommittee  and I can attest to the unique spirit whichevery four years brings together the world’s best athletes.I wish to pay tribute to them. They are an irreplaceableexample for the young people of our nations. I think it isright  here  to echo the appeal made by manyorganizations that there be more women representing theircountries at the Olympic Games  and that traditions however worthy of respect  do not become discriminationagainst women in the area of sport.The cooperation that has grown up between theUnited Nations and the Olympic Movement  which sharelofty universal principles and values  gives me great hope.8Our General Assembly regularly bolsters this cooperationin its resolutions  and I hope that the same will happen thisyear.These athletic  dynamic and devoted young peopleoften work as volunteers for the United Nations and non-governmental humanitarian organizations  and they deserveour heartfelt gratitude.I wish too to recall the World Programme of Actionfor Youth to the Year 2000 and Beyond  adopted last yearby the General Assembly in resolution 50/81. We must takeaccount of its recommendations in every area  particularlythose of education  employment  health  the environment and ensuring full  effective participation of women in thelife of society and in the decision-making process.The Principality of Monaco  which ratified theInternational Convention on the Elimination of All Formsof Racial Discrimination and is a party to the Conventionon the Rights of the Child  is very concerned bycontemporary forms of racism and marginalization. Weencourage the efforts of the United Nations and the SpecialRapporteur on this subject.We are also seriously alarmed by the development andscale of child prostitution and the trade in young girls andboys. An important initiative was taken last August by anon-governmental organization  End Child Prostitution inAsian Tourism  with the assistance of the United NationsChildren’s Fund (UNICEF) and the Government of Sweden.We must all heed the work of the world Congressagainst Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children. I amsure that the conclusions and recommendations of thisCongress  in the form of an agenda for action  will raiseour consciousness about the seriousness of the situation byencouraging States to adopt the necessary national andinternational measures.By participating in the Congress  Monaco showed itscommitment to a world policy to combat the commercialsexual exploitation of children. On the national level  thisis taking the form of unreserved support for humanitarianassociations and non-governmental organizations that areactive in this area and  in particular for their efforts tosensitize others to this scourge  to prevent it and torehabilitate its victims. We are also introducing a legislativeinitiative which should lead to a change in Monaco’s penalcode before the end of the year  with the introduction a newcrime: the sexual exploitation of children for the satisfactionof the vices of others  whether these events occur in thePrincipality of Monaco or outside our national territory.Once this law is in effect  any person apprehended inMonaco who has committed  in any place whatsoever acts that can be qualified as crimes or attacks againstdecency or morality according to the laws of Monaco asregards minors  can be prosecuted and tried.I would add that the international community mustalso think about strengthening international legalprotections in this area  in so far as existing texts including the 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child particularly its articles 19 and 21  often remaininoperative because they are difficult to apply.Similarly  the 1926 Slavery Convention  the 1956Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery and the 1949 Convention for the Suppression of theTraffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of theProstitution of Others  which are very general in scope do not provide sufficiently effective  speedy recourse inthis particular area  where emergency action is necessary.The strengthening of this protection in the form ofa multilateral instrument  for instance  could permitjudicial prosecution to go beyond national borders and forthe illicit commerce in children and their commercialsexual exploitation to be categorized as crimes againsthumanity  that is  that they be considered indefensibleunder the Convention on the Non-applicability ofStatutory Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes againstHumanity of 26 November 1968. Article 1 of thatConvention should thus be modified appropriately. Likethose stipulated in the 1948 Convention on the Preventionand Punishment of the Crime of Genocide  these actsshould not meet with a refusal to extradite. The law  andinternational law  should be fully capable of protectingthese weak  destitute beings  while leaving no chance ofimpunity for the perpetrators of these vile crimes.In addition to strengthening legal protections  weshould also give some thought to the steps needed torehabilitate these young victims  as broadly emphasizedby the Stockholm Congress; without such rehabilitation that these children would fall back into prostitution circlesmight prove inevitable.Although some of the behaviours I have justmentioned are intolerable and unacceptable  I wish nowto speak of the United Nations Year for Tolerance  whichended in December 1995. Adopted in December 1993thanks to a welcome initiative by the General Conferenceof the United Nations Educational  Scientific and CulturalOrganization  and supported by a unanimous resolution of9the General Assembly  this manifestation of faith inhumankind  concluded with a Declaration and Plan ofAction that were designed to inspire not only high-levelpoliticians  but each of us in our daily lives.In keeping with General Assembly resolution 49/213 the Follow-Up Plan of Action for the United Nations Yearfor Tolerance  accompanied by the Declaration of Principlesthat preceded it and that inspires it (A/51/201)  is beforethis year’s session of the General Assembly. It invites us tomake a common effort to combat political and socialfactors which often seem to be at the origin of intoleranceand hatred.This invitation should receive the proper response  forit could contribute to providing solutions to the tensionsthat persist in the world  some of which  as we know  areextremely disquieting.Throughout history  the most important moments ofprogress have certainly occurred during periods of real andprofound tolerance. Such tolerance favoured thought  thearts  the sciences  the sharing of knowledge and values. Itbuilt civilizations and enabled them to draw together andmutually enrich one another in an exceptional way.While many today are convinced that history probablyhas no meaning  it remains none the less a fragile andprecious commodity  largely fashioned by the commitmentsand the will of man.On 8 January next year we shall commemorate theseven-hundredth anniversary of the establishment of myfamily’s dynasty in Monaco. In celebration of that event many cultural and artistic events  some on an internationalscale  will take place throughout 1997. This will be our wayof paying a tribute to our past as well as of expressing ourconfidence and faith in the future and destiny  not only ofour country  but of mankind.On that note  I should like to conclude my statementby thanking the President very much for having allowed meto speak."
"106",4402,"MDA",51,1996,"﻿Allow me at the outset to congratulate Mr.Razali most warmly on his election as President of thissession of the General Assembly of the United Nations.I am convinced that his diplomatic qualities willcontribute greatly to the attainment of the objectives ofthis session. It is my pleasure to express my gratitude toHis Excellency Mr. Diego Freitas do Amaral for theexcellent conduct and competence that he displayedduring his presidency of the previous session.During the five years that have elapsed since thedeclaration of our independence  and in the four yearssince the Republic of Moldova was admitted to theUnited Nations  we have tried to show the whole worldthat we are a country that is seeking a worthy place in theinternational community. My country’s choice of the ruleof law and a market economy has led to an increase in itscredibility at the international level. I should like to assurethe Assembly that the Republic of Moldova is irreversiblycommitted to the path of democracy  which is the bestguarantee of sustainable development  peace and socialprogress. I should like to stress that the process ofdemocratic reforms in our country has been  andcontinues to be  supported by the United Nations and itsspecialized agencies  by the European organizations andby the entire international community. I take thisopportunity to extend thanks for this assistance  which isessential for our programme of reforms.The complex process of transition in the Republic ofMoldova and in the countries of Central and EasternEurope is facing difficulties that require additional means.This reform has also created negative social phenomena which have particularly affected the most vulnerablegroups of the population. To alleviate these undesirableeffects  the Government has adopted and implementedmeasures of social protection. The difficulties that we arefacing in promoting economic reforms are created notonly by a lack of experience but also by a shortage ofcommodities and financial and energy resources. In thisrespect  I should like to stress the importance of supportand encouragement offered to the Republic of Moldova26by the international financial institutions  by the UnitedNations specialized agencies and by certain developedcountries. We will also need such support in the future tosmoothly carry out our reforms.Integration into European economic and politicalstructures remains a priority of our foreign policy. We areconvinced that  given the objectives of economic and socialreform  the development and deepening of relations withthe Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe(OSCE)  the Council of Europe and the European Union  aswell as close cooperation in the context of the Partnershipfor Peace programme and the North Atlantic CooperationCouncil  take on a new dimension. Such a process alsocreates favourable conditions for the affirmation of theRepublic of Moldova as a sovereign and independent State.We state our willingness to cooperate with regionalorganizations to ensure stability in Europe as well as peaceand security throughout the world. The choice of permanentneutrality stipulated in our Constitution explains why theRepublic of Moldova is not participating in  and does notintend to join  the military structures of the Commonwealthof Independent States or of other regional organizations.The conflict in the eastern part of my country remainsan obstacle to democratization and to progress on economicreforms. We cannot ignore the continuing violations ofhuman rights in the Transdnestr. The internationalcommunity has been informed of them many times. Despiteour negotiations and many appeals of internationalorganizations  we have yet to obtain the release of themembers of the Ilascu group  who were sentenced andimprisoned illegally four years ago by the anti-constitutionalauthorities of Tiraspol.We are concerned that the Moldavianpopulation in the schools and institutions of this region ofthe country are banned from using Latin characters in thestudy of their mother tongue.This conflict still remains a central concern  despitenegotiations  despite the spirit of compromise of thepolitical leaders  and despite their will to resolve theproblems in the eastern zone through peaceful means  incooperation with international organizations such as theUnited Nations and the OSCE  and together with theassistance of the affected States  Russia and the Ukraine which have expressed their willingness to be guarantors.The Republic of Moldova believes that the onlysolution to the conflict lies in the development of a draftlaw related to the special status of Transdnestr as anintegral part of a unified and indivisible State  inaccordance with our Constitution. In the context ofnegotiations  we have already signed several interimdocuments covering various aspects of the normalizationof the situation in this region. We remain true to theprinciple of territorial integrity and of the sovereignty ofthe State  which we will always respect. Unfortunately the authorities of the anti-constitutional republic are notyet ready to accept the principle of territorial integrity andof the sovereignty of the State.We reaffirm our willingness to continue negotiationswith the authorities of Tiraspol in order to find a solutionto the Transdnestr conflict.We consider that the process of a peaceful anddefinitive solution to the conflict in the eastern zone ofthe Republic of Moldova could be considerablyaccelerated through the immediate  complete  ordered andunconditional withdrawal of military units of the RussianFederation.We are concerned by the fact that these foreigntroops continue to be stationed on the territory of theRepublic of Moldova  which is contrary to ourconstitutional stipulation of the neutrality of our country.Although the agreement between the Republic ofMoldova and the Russian Federation relating to the legalstatus  the method and the terms of withdrawal of Russianmilitary contingents stationed temporarily on the territoryof Moldova was signed two years ago  the Russian StateDuma has yet to ratify the agreement. We hope that thecompetent Russian authorities will accelerate the entryinto force and the implementation of the Moldovan-Russian agreement of 21 October 1994.As regards to the revitalization of the United Nationsand the reform of its structures in the spirit ofdemocratization and in accordance of the latest worlddevelopments  we note with satisfaction that the UnitedNations as a guarantor of international peace  stability andsecurity has expanded its efforts through improving themechanisms for maintaining peace and has intensified itsactivities in the area of preventive diplomacy and thesettlement of regional conflicts  and has developed newconcepts and means for crisis management such as stand-by commitments and rapid-reaction forces. The Republicof Moldova welcomes the efforts of the Conference onDisarmament towards the adoption of the ComprehensiveNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.At present  goals likely to help overcome thefinancial crisis by finding the resources necessary foreffective action by the United Nations are fundamental. In27our view  the reform of the United Nations must also coverthe financial aspect. We can attempt viable solutions onlywith the participation of all Member States.The Republic of Moldova is not indifferent to thissituation and will make efforts to meet its financialobligations. However  it is my duty to stress that we areobliged to bear an assessment that is calculated at a levelwhich is exaggerated in comparison with our realpossibilities. This calculation has led to a situation wherethe scale of assessments for our country is higher than thatof States with a similar level of development. It is hightime that we found an appropriate methodology reflectingthe capacity to pay of States. We hope that the spirit offairness and solidarity that reigns in the United Nations willlead the General Assembly to recommend that theCommittee on Contributions revise and readjust the scale ofassessment to the level of indices that would truly reflectthe parameters of the economies of Member States. In thiscontext  the Republic of Moldova supports the proposal ofthe European Union regarding the methodology regardingthe calculation of the scale of assessments  which weconsider to be fairer and more appropriate to the realpayment capacity of all Member States than that which isused now.The Republic of Moldova supports United Nationsreforms aimed at increasing the effectiveness of theOrganization and its main bodies  considering that thisinnovative process reflects reality and the changes whichhave occurred in the international system following thecold-war era.At the same time  the Government of the Republic ofMoldova attaches particular importance to the role theSecurity Council plays in preventing the development ofnew threats to peace and international security. Developingconflicts  acts of aggression and interference in the internalaffairs of States threaten regional and international security.The role of the Security Council in avoiding these dangersis of prime importance. Aware of this role of the SecurityCouncil as a collective decision-making body in the area ofpeace and international security  the Republic of Moldovaconsiders that a change in its composition must be carriedout without hindering its effectiveness.My delegation feels that an increase in the number ofseats on the Security Council should be carried out in abalanced way including both permanent and non-permanentseats  which would provide access for new members fromboth the North and the South. As regards new permanentseats  the President of our Republic  His ExcellencyMr. Mircea Snegur  proposed at the forty-ninth session ofthe General Assembly that the status of permanentmember be given to the major economic Powers whichplay an important role in economic affairs  such asGermany and Japan. As for the increase in the number ofnon-permanent seats  we find the Italian proposalinteresting  as it reflects the interests of most StatesMembers of the United Nations and offers a well-considered solution to this question.The Republic of Moldova is devoted to theprinciples and to the ideals of the Charter of the UnitedNations  and greatly appreciates the activities of theUnited Nations  which for more than five decades hasshown itself to be a forum for harmonizing the efforts ofthe peoples of the world in order to maintain internationalpeace and security and to ensure the development ofrelations of friendship and cooperation among MemberStates. The actions undertaken by the United Nations havefrom the very beginning pursued the goal of building newrelationships among countries of the whole world.After four years of activity as a full Member  theactions of the Republic of Moldova within the context ofthe United Nations remain among the priorities of itsforeign policy  aimed at giving our State a more activepresence at the international level as well as at thedevelopment and intensification of relations of friendshipand cooperation with all members of the internationalcommunity. The Republic of Moldova is in favour ofharmonizing the interests of Member States.In conclusion  I would like to express the hope thatthe particular constructive spirit of the United Nationswhich reigns once again at this session of the GeneralAssembly will enable us to respond to the challengesfacing the international community at this time. I amconvinced that the United Nations will remain a guaranteeof international peace and security and of economic andsocial development worldwide. My delegation expressesits willingness to contribute to effective cooperation withthe delegations of all Member States in order to attain thepurposes of the United Nations."
"107",4446,"MDG",51,1996,"﻿In common with the speakers preceding me  Ishould like to congratulate you upon your election to thepresidency of the fifty-first session of the GeneralAssembly. We see it not only as a recognition of yourpersonal qualities  but also  and above all  the consecrationof the distinguished part played by your country in theinternational arena. Through your person  the honour thatderives from your election is shared with the membercountries of the Non-Aligned Movement  which gives usparticular pride. I would like to assure you of the completecooperation and full support of the delegation ofMadagascar  which it is my privilege to lead.My congratulations also go to the other members ofthe General Committee  to whom we wish every success intheir work.Lastly  I would like to take this opportunity to expressto your predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Diogo Freitas doAmaral  our warm gratitude for all the efforts that he madeduring his term as President of the Assembly at its fiftiethsession. I would like to assure him that we followedclosely and with interest the activities and contacts whichhe undertook on behalf of our Organization and in orderto further its objectives.The disappearance of the political and ideologicaldivisions arising from the cold war gave birth to hopesfor greater international security  stability  peace andprosperity  so that the international community couldhenceforth focus its efforts on the establishment of a just equitable and truly multilateral and non-discriminatoryinternational order  and on the strengthening ofcooperation for international development. These hopes however  not been fulfilled. A feeling of anxiety prevailsin the face of the imbalances  insecurity  tensions andcontradictions clouding the prospects for peace andeconomic development. The forces of conflict have grownto dangerous proportions as they have spilled overfrontiers  and have assumed various forms such asterrorism  separatism  fundamentalism  intolerance andxenophobia.Similarly  the interdependent world economycontinues to be dominated by uncertainty  imbalances andrecession. Negative economic growth rates  persistentimbalances in the commercial and financial fields increased transitional or structural unemployment  and anabsence of coordination in exchange rates and tradepolicies — these are some of the problems connectedwith the system of the developed world which have anadverse impact on the developing countries. For in factthe resources allocated to cooperation for developmenthave fallen  on the pretext that up to now this has achievednothing for the beneficiary countries  including ourcountries in Africa  whose priorities  at both national andcontinental level  have been to relieve absolute  endemicpoverty  to eradicate hunger and malnutrition  to overcomedisease and illiteracy  and to meet the needs for housingand sanitation.In this connection  just as we welcomed Habitat II lastJune in Istanbul  we commend the initiative of the Director-General of the Food and Agriculture Organization of theUnited Nations (FAO) to convene the World Food Summitnext November in Rome  to sensitize international opinionto the problem of hunger in the world  thereby revivinginterest in the subject that has apparently waned.Thus it is clear that the world today is confronted withurgent social and economic problems which  at the national regional and international levels  require efforts and theimplementation of policies and measures that can provideurgent solutions. The future of world trade  financial andmonetary regimes  economic growth and socialdevelopment  as well as human rights  the environment andpopulation in relation to development  are vital issues thatinextricably link the fate and destiny of all countries.It is therefore comforting to recall the solemncommitment made by the international community on theoccasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations on the night of 24 October 1995  to mobilize in the questfor peace  security  development and stability. In order toattain these objectives and successfully discharge thefunctions assigned to it in the Charter  the United Nationsneeds to be reformed in order to adjust to a world inconstant change.With respect to the increase in the membership of theSecurity Council  the principle is accepted in general  if forno other reason than to respond to the increase in thenumber of United Nations Member States. The proposalsput forward in this context are as interesting as they arevaried  each invoking praiseworthy objectives  depending onone’s viewpoint. Thus the Italian proposal  drawing on theprinciple established in Article 23 of the Charter  highlightsthe need to favour the geographical regions that arecurrently under-represented. This comes close to theconcern of countries such as Madagascar  which whollysubscribes to the decision taken by the African summit inJuly 1996  namely that the Security Council must becomemore representative in nature and reflect the composition ofthe Organization in a new international system  so as tocorrect the geographical imbalance that now characterizesit and make it a genuine organ for the execution of theGeneral Assembly’s resolutions.The African position gives priority for the timebeing to an increase in the number of members. bothpermanent and non-permanent. This restructuring of theSecurity Council should allocate two new permanent seatsto Africa  three to Asia  two to Latin America and theCaribbean  and one to the European and other States.With respect to the post of Secretary-General of theUnited Nations  Madagascar associates itself with thechorus of all African countries  through the Declaration ofYaoundé  which reaffirmed Africa’s right to a secondterm in the Secretary-General’s post  as has been thepractice since the creation of the Organization.Accordingly  Madagascar supports the re-election ofMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  one of whose main objectiveshas been to identify and elaborate concrete proposals forthe recovery and development of Africa so as to make theUnited Nations system’s support to the continent aseffective as possible. In that context  the support of theinternational community as a whole is a must.We take note of the progress achieved in resolvingthe debt problem and in the implementation of the Naplesterms  as well as the recommendations made by theGroup of Seven summit convened in Lyon in June 1996.The developing countries  particularly in Africa  certainlyneed substantial international support  but it is above allthe responsibility of our leaders and peoples to make thenecessary changes to create a suitable sociopoliticalclimate for development on a large scale. Thus we haveno choice but to continue to work  by ourselves to beginwith  to achieve collective self-reliance at the national regional and continental levels. For its part  Madagascar which has just completed its economic policy frameworkdocument  hopes in the near future to benefit fromadditional measures from its creditors going beyond theNaples terms to give a fresh impetus to its development.Indeed  in today’s world of multidimensionalinterdependence  any failure in development can onlyharm us all  rich and poor alike  since poverty is definedin terms of collective responsibility and the rights ofevery individual.In the field of human rights  efforts must be steppedup to translate into real action the 1992 Declaration onthe Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic Religious and Linguistic Minorities  adopted by theGeneral Assembly.2With respect to the challenges arising in the MiddleEast  Bosnia and Northern Ireland  we note that we areadvancing in the right direction. Madagascar is attentivelyfollowing the recent phases  particularly as regards thepeace process between Israel and the Palestinians.Moreover  like all peoples of the world  we reaffirm ourwish to see the peaceful reunification of Korea.In the face of the situation obtaining in the WesternSahara after the Security Council’s decision of May 1996 Madagascar remains concerned.The frequent setbacks experienced by the conventionalapproach to peacekeeping should persuade us to perseverein our efforts to prevent conflict and give subregionalstructures responsibility for the maintenance of peace  asadvocated in the United Nations Secretary-General’sAgenda for Peace  and as applied by the Organization ofAfrican Unity (OAU) Mechanism for Conflict Prevention Management and Resolution.Against this background  the General Assembly shouldbe given appropriate powers to have access to mechanismsfor the peaceful settlement of conflicts. The mechanisms forthe peaceful settlement of conflicts should be strengthenedin the light of the provisions advocated in the Agenda forPeace. When peace is restored  the role of United Nationsforces as a buffer in international  civil or ethnic conflictsshould also be strengthened. Madagascar intends toparticipate concretely in peacekeeping operations. Regionalstructures for conflict resolution  such as those that existwithin the United Nations  the Organization of AfricanUnity and the Non-Aligned Movement  should again bestrengthened.For us  the Mechanism for Conflict Prevention Management and Resolution has proved its usefulness inAfrica in a number of cases  inter alia  through theintervention of regional units of the Economic Communityof West African States (ECOWAS) and the Inter-Governmental Authority on Drought and Development(IGADD)  which have operated respectively in sub-SaharanAfrica and in the Sahel. Madagascar fully subscribes to thisapproach  as is borne out by its direct involvement in themediation process for the settlement of the Comorianconflict in 1995.The signing of the Pelindaba Text of the AfricanNuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty this year attests to thewillingness of the African countries to banish all nuclearweapons from their soil. Madagascar  faithful to itsprinciples  is now initiating the procedure for accession tothis Treaty. It is in this connection that Madagascar hasjust signed the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.Similarly  my country also considers that the extension ofthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons(NPT) is an initial response to the major challenges of ourtime in the area of nuclear proliferation and armslimitation.In the environmental sphere  after the legitimateconcerns expressed by Heads of State and Government atthe United Nations Conference on Environment andDevelopment (UNCED) in Rio de Janeiro  energeticmeasures must be taken through a common commitmentby all countries. There is no need to demonstrate thatenvironmental problems know neither political nor naturalboundaries. Nevertheless  at the domestic level  it must beemphasized that people are not always sensitive to thealmost irreconcilable concepts of conservation andprotection and meeting basic needs (heating  fuel fisheries resources  etc.).It is in the light of these considerations thatMadagascar has opted for a gradual approach regardingits accession to international environmental conventions.Thus the country has set up a basic framework forenvironmental policy  termed the Environmental Charter.It has drawn up an environmental programme in threestages phased over a 15-year period; negotiations formulti-donor financing of this programme have just beencompleted in September in Paris.With respect to international conventions Madagascar has ratified the main Conventions  includingthe Convention on Biological Diversity  the UnitedNations International Convention to CombatDesertification in Those Countries Experiencing SeriousDrought and/or Desertification  Particularly in Africa  theVienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer and the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete theOzone Layer. As it implements these variousConventions  Madagascar wishes to enlist theparticipatory involvement of its people  and thus apply theprinciple of “Think globally — act locally”.Lastly  one year after the Beijing Conference andone year after the Copenhagen summit  I would not wishto conclude without recalling Madagascar’s efforts in thesocial sphere  as demonstrated by the permanentstructures within successive Governments for the benefitof women  children and social problems in general.3At the dawn of the twenty-first century  Madagascar like all nations on earth  aspires to a world of peace andprogress in which the scourges of war  poverty anddestruction will be banished forever. The United Nations isthe ideal place to build such a world  provided that allpeoples and all leaders have the necessary political will andtransform into reality all the promises made. That is theMalagasy delegation’s ardent hope."
"108",4485,"MDV",51,1996,"﻿At the outset  allow me  Sir to say how gratified we are to see you presiding over thisAssembly. Your election to that high office is a well-deserved recognition of your personal qualities andexperience  and also of Malaysia’s important role in thisOrganization and in the international arena. I have nodoubt that you will lead the work of this Assembly to afruitful conclusion.It is also my privilege to pay tribute to yourpredecessor  His Excellency Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaralof Portugal  for the exemplary manner in which hedischarged his onerous responsibilities.I would also like to take this opportunity to paytribute to the Secretary-General  His ExcellencyMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for his untiring efforts in thecause of peace and development. While we realize thedifficulties and the complexity of the challenges that lieahead in the years to come  we remain confident in hiswisdom and competence in steering this universalOrganization towards the fulfilment of its responsibilitiesin accordance with the principles of the Charter. Mydelegation sincerely wishes him every success in hisendeavours.Last year  we proudly celebrated 50 years ofachievements. As we slowly begin the countdown to thecentenary celebration of the United Nations  on behalf ofthe generations to come  we see ourselves coincidentallyon the threshold of a new century as well. My delegationfeels that this is a unique opportunity for all of us torededicate ourselves to the purposes and principles of theCharter with greater determination and commitment tostrengthening the United Nations so that the menacingtrends in human relations which caused so much miseryand destruction in the past can be halted and reversed and that existing inequalities among nations and peoplescan be eliminated  creating a new atmosphere of toleranceand mutual respect  and a new sense of sharedresponsibility for development and progress.6Over the past 50 years  the Organization has grownfourfold and has become the most representative —certainly the only universal — institution serving thepurpose of maintaining international peace and security.This truly global Organization has an immense capability tomobilize international efforts to deal with global problemsrelating to economic  social and environmental issues. Italso possesses the potency to promote universal standardsof human rights despite differences in the historical  culturaland religious backgrounds of nations and communities.Admittedly  the Organization has experienced rough timesand has suffered several setbacks during the course of itsexistence. However  with the demise of the cold war thathaunted the Organization for nearly four decades  a morefavourable environment has emerged  enabling us torespond collectively to the challenges of the future.My country is among the smallest and the leastdeveloped countries of this Organization. For us  the UnitedNations is extremely important in safeguarding oursovereignty  independence and territorial integrity. For us it is the protector of freedom and justice  particularly forthe weak and the vulnerable. It is also the beacon of hopefor hundreds of millions of people in the developing worldfor a better future free from hunger and disease. Therefore we feel the need to steadily strengthen  revitalize andreform the Organization in order to make it more effective more democratic  and ready to react and respond withoutbias to situations that threaten international peace andsecurity.It was with this in mind that we joined in theinitiative  way back in 1979  to include on the agenda anitem on the question of equitable representation on andincrease in the membership of the Security Council. Mydelegation welcomes the reform and adjustment process thatis now under way and sincerely hopes that the process willnot compromise the principles of the Charter  whichemphasize multilateralism  mutual respect and sharedinterests  including the interests of small States. In thiscontext  my delegation feels that the proposal made by Italyin the Working Group on the reform and restructuring ofthe Security Council deserves our attention and carefulconsideration. There is no doubt that the morerepresentative the United Nations is  the more democraticit will be; and that the more accountable the United Nationsis  the more effective it will be  thus benefitting us all small or large  weak or powerful  rich or poor.Reforming the Organization alone will not serve thedesired purposes unless the commitment of MemberStates to uphold and abide by the principles of theCharter and their obligations is fulfilled. We areconcerned that the Organization is undergoing the worstfinancial crisis in its history. We are reminded that themain cause of the financial predicament is the failure ofMember States to meet their financial obligations on timeand in full. While my delegation has every sympathytowards those countries which have genuine difficulties we note that by far the greater number of cases in arrearsare those which have the capability to pay. We note withdisappointment that the richest Member of thisOrganization is among those who fail or refuse to paytheir dues. It is ironic that the effects of this severefinancial crisis have to be borne most adversely by thesmaller and the poorer States of the Organization  whichin many cases are obligated under the current scale ofassessments to pay more than their fair share. In spite ofits limited resources and the frequent economicdifficulties it faces  I am pleased to say that my countrycontinues to pay its share of contribution in full  as weare convinced that only resources and efforts can produceresults.Meanwhile my delegation believes that the efforts ofthe international community to reform the administrativeand budgetary functioning of the United Nations shouldaim at utilizing the scarce resources of the Organizationmore efficiently. In this regard  the efforts of theSecretary-General to achieve a more lean and effectiveSecretariat geared to take on the challenging tasksentrusted to it warrant recognition. We also welcome therecent measures towards eliminating redundancy duplication and waste  for only a sound organization canensure the success of its mission.The world has never offered a greater opportunitythan today to address critical developmental problems andchallenges. The international community has emphasizedthe importance of a revitalized and enhanced system ofinternational cooperation for development. The sheernumber of major international conferences held during thepast few years and the collective resolve documentedoffer adequate testimony to this strong desire. Theoutcome of these conferences fostered a common conceptof sustainable economic development for the bettermentof mankind as a whole. However  despite all thesepositive developments on the international economic andsocial scene  my delegation is convinced that unless theseambitious programmes are backed by the necessaryresources and political will  no change can be achieved.7We also feel that all activities of international economic anddevelopment cooperation  including those undertaken by theBretton Woods institutions and the World TradeOrganization  must be coordinated and closely linked withthe development strategies and programmes of the UnitedNations system. After all  this Organization remains themost representative institution.While the globalization and liberalization of the worldeconomy gave some developing countries the opportunityto assume a more prominent status in the world economy the least-developed countries — a category to which mycountry unfortunately belongs — continued to bemarginalized. The standard of living in least-developedcountries has in effect declined over the years  and thepoverty level has intensified in many of these countries dueto indolent economic growth  which in turn was subject tooutside factors. The overall decline in official developmentassistance over the years has further aggravated theconditions of the least-developed countries at a time whenaid is most needed.This unfavourable situation  if allowed to drag on could be calamitous for countries  such as the Maldives with severe resource constraints and fragile infrastructures.For this reason  my delegation can only appeal for priorityaction on various international development commitments such as the Paris Declaration and Programme of Action forLeast Developed Countries for the 1990s. These have beenendorsed at various recent global conferences. Admittedly liberalization of trade has resulted in greater trade.However  liberalization has also meant the loss of the onlyadvantage that the least-developed countries had — theirprivileged status — and the consequent loss of theirmarkets. Liberalization has therefore  in effect  contributedto the marginalization of many developing countries.The inherent obstacles facing small States  particularlysmall island States  and their vulnerability  deserve specialattention. Small island States like my own require favouredtreatment to prevent them from slipping back from theirwell-earned achievements.In this context  I also wish to express the need for anincisive examination of the criteria for least-developed-country status and related issues  including the graduationprocess  in order to do justice to the poorest among thepoor countries when the criteria come up for review nextyear. The per capita index used to classify countries forassistance purposes is no longer adequate  particularly inthe case of small States. It fails to capture the specialproblems faced by these countries and their vulnerability toexternal shocks. In this context  the development and useof a vulnerability index  along with other criteria  may befeasible in order to minimize these inadequacies.On the other hand  many of the poorest countries arestill entangled in a web of external debt from which theyare unlikely ever to be able to free themselves. Mydelegation believes that more steps should be taken to liftthe debt burden from the poorest and most indebtedcountries by increasing the debt relief measures ofbilateral creditors and by greater involvement ofmultilateral agencies in this responsibility. The developedcountries can also help in eliminating the situation bydemolishing the barriers they still maintain againstimports from the less developed countries  in particularthose which are suffering from the burdens of externaldebt.Poverty cannot be eliminated through charity  butonly through cooperation. In this context  we welcome theproposal of the countries of the Organization forEconomic Cooperation and Development to cut thenumber of people living in absolute poverty by half in thenext two decades.We are fully committed to the efforts of theinternational community to safeguard the globalenvironment  especially by building the capacity of theUnited Nations to promote sustainable development forall. We welcome the work carried out by the Commissionon Sustainable Development in this regard  and arelooking forward to the forthcoming United NationsConference on Environment and Development reviewconference in 1997. My delegation is confident that thisreview process will give the international community theopportunity to rededicate itself once again to thepreservation of the global environment. Only concertedefforts on all fronts can produce encouraging results inthis daunting challenge. For the Maldives  theenvironment is an important issue. We are conscious ofthe fragility of our islands and we hope to be able toprotect them from the potential dangers arising fromglobal warming and sea-level rise. We are alsodetermined to keep our country environment-friendly clean and unpolluted. Though the land area we have is solimited  I am happy to mention that in the Maldives weinitiated a programme in January this year for plantingone million trees in three years; I presume that if allcountries represented here would initiate similarprogrammes at a rate of four trees per capita  the worldwould be greener and cleaner in 10 years.8The importance of disarmament for the preservationand maintenance of world peace and security cannot beoveremphasized. We believe that  with the treaties andbilateral agreements concluded  and the ongoingnegotiations among the nuclear-weapon States  and alsowith the indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons last year  the internationalcommunity is now reaffirming its commitment to globaldisarmament and renewing the hopes for the eventualelimination of nuclear weapons and other weapons of massdestruction. My delegation is pleased about the positiveapproaches taken by the nuclear-weapon States towards theadoption of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty despite the lack of consensus. We are particularly happythat the Treaty has now been opened for signature.We also would like to praise the role played by theUnited Nations in demining and mine clearance  and tocongratulate those involved in this dangerous activity fortheir bravery and dedication. Anti-personnel landmines havecaused enormous human suffering and continue to maimand incapacitate countless innocent men  women andchildren. We look forward to a worldwide ban on thishorrible and inhuman instrument of killing.My delegation is firmly committed to the concept ofthe establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones and zonesof peace and would like to take this opportunity to callupon all regions  especially the countries in the region ofSouth Asia  to which we belong  to make every effort tobring about the proposed nuclear-weapon-free zone in SouthAsia without any further delay.Internal strife generated and fanned by ethnic religious and other factors is a recent trend  which iscausing large conflagrations in some parts of the world.While our Organization gropes for effective mechanisms torespond to such exigencies  we should not ignore theserious threats posed by drug traffickers  terrorists andmercenaries  particularly to small States. Terrorist incidentshave increased alarmingly over the last few years. Mydelegation is fully convinced that the internationalcommunity should intensify its efforts to combat terrorism.The early entry into force of the Convention against theRecruitment  Use  Financing and Training of Mercenarieswill be a step forward in addressing these threats. We urgeall States which have not yet done so to ratify theConvention as early as possible. Similarly  my delegationwould like to call for the strongest possible internationalaction against drug traffickers  who are not only poisoningthe fabric of human life but also draining the potential forproductivity and prosperity of nations by exploiting thevulnerable elements in our societies.Though deeply concerned over the recent violence inPalestine and in the occupied lands  which resulted in thedeath or injury of hundreds of men  women and children my delegation is happy to observe that despite thenumerous difficulties that exist  the Middle East peaceprocess is continuing to move forward. We fervently hopethat the agreements reached so far will be implementedfully and without further delay.The important and critical role played by theproponents of the peace process  especially the UnitedStates  deserves the appreciation and praise of theinternational community and should not be forgotten. Mydelegation is convinced that their positive role willcontinue to be instrumental to the success of the peaceprocess. At the same time  we also feel that the UnitedNations should continue to play its important role inproviding means to the Palestinian people in their juststruggle for the restoration of their inalienable rights including the right to self-determination and to theestablishment of a sovereign State which could coexistwith its neighbours in peace and harmony.The situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina isencouraging  but we need to remain alert. The DaytonAgreement has finally paved the way to creating a lastingpeace in Bosnia. The fulfilment of the commitments ofthe international community is  however  critical to theachievement and consolidation of full peace. We alsobelieve that it is important and necessary to bring thoseresponsible for the atrocities and the crimes of genocideto justice and to punish them.My delegation remains convinced that the UnitedNations is the most viable and dependable universalinstitution today. It is the responsibility of all of us toallow this universal Organization to play a more centraland active role in shaping and harnessing internationalcooperation for economic growth and development. It isalso our conviction that the dedication and collectiveendeavours of the international community  which haveenabled the United Nations to survive the past 50 years will inspire us all to greater heights of unity andcooperation so as to preserve and maintain the principlesof the Charter  promote its objectives  and strengthen theOrganization  thereby enabling it to better serve andenhance the well-being of the peoples of the world.9"
"109",4532,"MEX",51,1996,"﻿Let me begin by conveying to the President mywarmest congratulations on his election as President ofthis session of the General Assembly  which is12recognition  not just of his personal qualities  but also of theleading role Malaysia is called on to play in a part of theworld that is characterized by the rapid pace of itseconomic development and where we are engaging in jointefforts as members of Asia-Pacific Economic CooperationCouncil.My country wishes to express its recognition of thespirit of rationality and moderation that has marked the wayin which the President has discharged his duties in thisperiod of restructuring as part of the complex task ofmaintaining peace as the essential prerequisite for ensuringa more just world free from discrimination of any kind andaberrant xenophobia. As this is the moment of truth for theUnited Nations  we wish to express our hope that the workhe has done in guiding this Organization so far willcontinue so as to consolidate the restructuring process.In the face of the two options that exist for resolvingthe constant and recurrent crises that afflict the world —law and justice on the one hand  force and violence on theother — Mexico has always opted for the former.We are here not to engage in a mere ritual act  but toreiterate our full commitment to this common effort that weinitiated half a century ago. This commitment has to berenewed every day  because peace and security are not freegifts bestowed once and for all  but values that have to beconquered and maintained from day to day.A year ago  the world’s leaders came together in thisforum to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of ourOrganization. They reaffirmed the validity of the principlesand purposes embodied in the Charter of the United Nationsand agreed on new parameters for our collective activity.The complex effort made in 1996 to ensure a properfollow-up to them must continue to be our target for thecoming year.Although not with the forcefulness and clarity thatwould be justified by current law and demanded by theinternational community  the International Court of Justicerecognized  in an Advisory Opinion of July this year  thatthe use or threat of use of nuclear weapons run counter tointernational law. The Court also emphasized that“there exists an obligation on all States to pursue ingood faith and bring to a conclusion negotiationsleading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects understrict and effective international control.”The General Assembly must give immediate effect to thisby urging the initiation of negotiations on the subject inthe Conference on Disarmament.While we welcome this ruling  we do not agree withanother assertion of the Court within the Opinion that thethreat or use of nuclear weapons could be legal in theextreme circumstance of self-defence.The Treaty of Tlatelolco  which Mexico promotedand for which it acts as depositary  was the first legalinstrument specifically to establish a nuclear-weapon-freezone in a densely populated region. Mexico will continueto encourage the strengthening of the regime establishedby this Treaty  which has undoubtedly served as aprecedent for other treaties establishing nuclear-weapon-free zones throughout the world.Mexico welcomes the recent addition of the newSouth-East Asia Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone to thosealready existing in the South Pacific and in Africa. Wehope that we shall soon be able to add another nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East  which wouldundoubtedly help to promote détente in that area. Wefirmly support Brazil’s initiative to proclaim the southernhemisphere of our planet a nuclear-weapon-free zone.On 24 September  just a few days ago  Mexicosigned the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty(CTBT). Despite the fact that its structure is not entirelysatisfactory  particularly with respect to its entry intoforce  we signed it because we believe that it is a vitalstep in a programme of action for the completeelimination of nuclear weapons  the ultimate objective ofour efforts in this connection. Mexico and 27 othercountries members of the Conference on Disarmamenthave already submitted a draft programme that we hopecan be considered as soon as possible. If we make enoughprogress in this direction  it might even be possible toovercome one of the main obstacles to the entry intoforce of the CTBT  which is currently being hindered bythose obstacles mentioned earlier. Meanwhile  until theTreaty — on which we worked for almost two years ofnegotiations — comes into force  we urge all countries toguide their actions in accordance with its text  even beforeits formal entry into force.It is a matter of great concern that the two Powersacknowledged to possess chemical weapons havepostponed ratification of the Convention on theProhibition of the Development  Production  Stockpilingand Use of Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction 13which took us 20 years to negotiate and requires only twomore ratifications to enter fully into force. We shall beinitiating consultations with a view to submitting a draftresolution on this subject. We urge the United StatesCongress and the Russian Federation to ratify theConvention as soon as possible.Also on the subject of disarmament  we wish to drawattention to the fact that the President of Mexico Mr. Ernesto Zedillo  recently made two proposals at the RioGroup summit in Cochabamba  Bolivia. The first concernedthe need to adopt a convention against the illegal armstrade  which relates directly to the struggle in which we areall engaged against drug trafficking  crime and terrorism.The second concerned the desirability of adopting measuresfor the control of conventional offensive weapons in LatinAmerica with a view to avoiding arms races that woulddivert resources essential to our economic development.We welcome the Canadian initiative  to which Mexicogives its unreserved support  regarding the initiation ofconsultations with a view to securing  as speedily aspossible  a total ban on the deployment  transfer  productionand stockpiling of anti-personnel landmines. We believe thematter to be both important and urgent. Accordingly  wepropose that this Assembly consider this issue in that light.It is precisely because we do not see peace as themere absence of war that we believe that internationalpeace and security must be embodied in development andequity. Peace is inseparable from development; security isinseparable from prosperity. If we sow today fordevelopment  we shall reap the peace  security andinternational harmony that must mark the world of the nextmillennium.Accordingly  Mexico enthusiastically supports thework of the United Nations and its specialized agencies oneconomic and social issues and  in particular  the adoptionof an agenda for development as the basis of its efforts toeradicate poverty.That is why we view with growing concern the factthat  in supposed support of freedom and democracy  actionis being taken in the opposite direction through the adoptionof laws in the field of trade — the nerve centre ofcontemporary progress — that are extraterritorial in scopeand in complete disagreement with the fundamentalprinciples of international law. I would draw theAssembly’s attention to the opinion of the Inter-AmericanJuridical Committee of the Organization of AmericanStates  distributed in document A/51/394  on the subject ofthe so-called Helms-Burton Act. It argues convincinglythat this Act is not in keeping with international law. It isneither by means of blockades or exclusions  nor by theapplication of sanctions on third countries that democracyand human rights can be promoted. Dialogue  inclusion inmultilateral forums  trade  investment and the exchange ofinformation and persons have always proven to be thebest way to disseminate the values we all share.Drug trafficking has attained unprecedented levelsworldwide  to the point where it has become one of themost serious threats to the integrity of societies and thevery security of nations. Despite the vast resourcesdirected by Governments towards combating illicit drugs the power of the drug traffickers is increasing  as is thenumber of victims claimed by drug addiction and thecollateral damage caused to the social environment andthe economy. There is an urgent need to draw up and putinto effect measures and strategies which  on the basis ofinternational cooperation and shared responsibility  willmake it possible to launch a comprehensive attack on thisphenomenon and to do away with partial and subjectiveevaluations in rating the level of compliance of eachGovernment in combating drug trafficking  or  still worse in making use of this rating as a political weapon andpressure tactic.We trust that  in the course of this session  theGeneral Assembly will take a fundamental step tointensify the fight against drug trafficking by conveningin 1998  on the recommendation of the Economic andSocial Council  a special session to assess the state ofinternational cooperation in combating the production sale  demand  trafficking and unlawful distribution ofnarcotics  psychotropic substances and related activities.Once the draft resolution on this issue is adopted  weshall have to get down to the task of preparing anappropriate agenda for that special session  incorporatingthe specific ideas put forward in the Economic and SocialCouncil and in this Assembly. In this connection  thestatement made on 23 September by the President ofColombia  Dr. Ernesto Samper Pizano  is of specialinterest.Mexico recognizes and scrupulously respects thesovereign right of every nation to determine the rules andconditions for the admission of foreign workers to itsterritory. Nevertheless  the situation of our nationals inforeign countries has become a source of legitimateconcern to all sectors of society in my country inresponse to the emergence of disturbing outbreaks ofracism and xenophobia in some countries to which14migratory flows are directed. We firmly reject all actions oromissions on the part of national and local authorities in therecipient countries that may contribute to creating orexacerbating an atmosphere of violence and intoleranceagainst such workers and their families. In our view  themere existence of such a climate runs counter to the basicassumption of respect for the human rights and fundamentalfreedoms of all. Mexico believes that this complex problemmust be approached in a way that goes beyond meremeasures of repression and humiliation  but is rathercomprehensive  objective  broad in scope and responsive toregional and subregional characteristics.My country is convinced that the early entry into forceof the International Convention on the Protection of theRights of All Migrant Workers and Members of TheirFamilies is certain to constitute an appropriate frameworkfor the protection of the rights of millions of people whoemigrate in search of better living conditions. Moreover  webelieve that it is necessary to draw up  as part of the effortto protect the human rights of migrants  minimum rules thatwill protect them in any recipient country  regardless oftheir legal status and of the protection afforded them by thelaws of the country to which they emigrate. We shall besubmitting proposals in this regard at the next session ofthe Commission on Human Rights.Meanwhile  Mexico has been making a major effort toimprove the treatment and protection of the migrantsentering our territory across the southern border. Moreover the Mexican Government has recently taken a decision toregularize the migratory status of more than 30 000refugees  most of them Guatemalan  who have settled incamps in the States of Campeche and Quintana Roo underthe auspices of the United Nations High Commissioner forRefugees. In a joint effort with all the countries of CentralAmerica — including Belize and Panama — and the UnitedStates and Canada  Mexico has embarked on a campaign tocombat and punish illegal trafficking in persons  which hasnow taken on the attributes of international organizedcrime. We are also working to pass legislation at thecongressional level to increase the penalties and lengthenthe sentences for those found guilty of this illegaltrafficking.As the Heads of State and Government of the so-called Group of 16  of which Mexico is a member indicated on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of theUnited Nations  it is vital that we strengthen the multilateralapproach to solving the problems that affect the communityas a whole. We view with particular concern the lack ofsubstantive progress in the various working groupsresponsible for examining the main aspects of the reformof the Organization  and for this reason we should like topropose that efforts be concentrated in the followingareas.The capacity of the United Nations to preventconflicts and resolve those that already exist must beenhanced. This would include  among other actions breaking the deadlock in the reform of the SecurityCouncil  whose primary responsibility is the maintenanceof international peace and security. Secondly  measuresshould be taken to strengthen the mechanisms forresolving conflicts and disputes by peaceful meansthrough a convention on the subject. And  finally  the roleof the Secretary-General in conflict prevention should bestrengthened. An example of what action by theSecretary-General can achieve is the important agreementsigned in Mexico City on 19 September between theGovernment of Guatemala and the general command ofthe Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca  whichwill make a significant contribution to the attainment oflasting peace in that country  and in which theSecretary-General and a group of friends  includingMexico  participated.From this rostrum I wish to pay tribute to the workof the Moderator  which was essential to the signing ofsix substantive agreements in the Guatemalan process.Now we are awaiting only the signing of a fewoperational agreements  which will lead to the earlyestablishment of a lasting peace in that country.With regard to the reform of the Security Council Mexico considers it essential that in evaluating theproposals before us  account should be taken of the needfor that organ’s composition to reflect the increase in themembership of the Organization  while strictly respectingthe wishes of the countries of each region and theprinciple of equitable geographical representation.The United Nations must also strengthen itsactivities in the protection of human rights andfundamental freedoms  again on the basis of thecontractual obligations entered into by each State  and ineliminating any vestiges of colonialism or ofdiscrimination on grounds of sex  religion  race orpolitical conviction.One of the most urgent and complex issues of thereform process is that of revising the financing systemand the criteria for establishing the contributions ofMember States. But let us be frank: the financial crisis15the United Nations is experiencing stems primarily from thelack of timely payment of assessed contributions by aconsiderable number of countries. This situation must benormalized as speedily as possible.The maintenance of international peace and securitycontinues to be the primary mission of the United Nations.Barely seven years ago  a sigh of relief marked the endingof the long night of the cold war. Hopes were reborn that with peace strengthened  confidence in the United Nationswould grow  the ambitions of dominance on the part of theeconomically and militarily powerful countries would cease and a spirit of tolerance and harmony  of equity and mutualassistance — indispensable for the building of a betterworld — would soon develop. There was talk of “peacedividends”. The reality has been more complex.Mexico expresses its dismay at the violent incidentsthat have occurred recently in the Middle East and joins theappeal of the international community to all partiesconcerned to refrain from undertaking any actions thatcould worsen the situation and provoke further clashes.Such incidents constitute a dramatic reminder of the needfor the parties to redouble their efforts with a view toadvancing the peace process and ensuring that dialogue andreason prevail in the region.Despite the magnitude of the obstacles that have to beovercome in order to ensure that human beings areeducated for peace  Mexico maintains a profound faith inthe United Nations  whose structures must be strengthenedif we truly wish to give it the necessary capacity todischarge the complex and lofty tasks entrusted to it half acentury ago  as well as those additional tasks it is chargedwith almost daily.With renewed optimism  we trust that human beingsstill possess the resourcefulness and talent required to makethis world a worthy and just abode for all."
"110",4558,"MHL",51,1996,"﻿I wish to take thisopportunity on behalf of His Excellency President AmataKabua and the Government and the people of theRepublic of the Marshall Islands to thank and toacknowledge the leadership of the outgoing President Professor Diogo Freitas do Amaral  and also tocongratulate you  Ambassador Razali Ismail  on yourwell-deserved election to the high office of the Presidencyof the General Assembly.I am pleased to inform you  Sir  that at the recentlyconcluded South Pacific Forum meeting in the Republicof the Marshall Islands  your country  Malaysia  wasinvited to join the post-forum dialogue next year as apartner  where we hope to further our cooperation.In our capacity as Chairman of the South PacificForum  I have the honour first to make some remarks ofa regional nature on behalf of the Forum members thatare also United Nations Members  followed by someremarks of a more national perspective.The South Pacific Forum held its twenty-seventhmeeting last month in Majuro  the capital of the Republicof the Marshall Islands. The theme for this session “Pacific Solidarity for the Common Good”  highlights oneof the important building blocks of our regionalcooperation towards sustainable development. The Forumleaders reviewed a broad range of measures in the area ofeconomic reform and development. These and otherimportant decisions of the South Pacific Forum leadersare contained in the Forum communiqué  which has beensubmitted to the Secretary-General and will be circulatedas an official United Nations document.In his opening remarks to the Forum at Majuro  thePresident of the Republic of the Marshall Islands  HisExcellency Mr. Amata Kabua  emphasized the unity andthe harmony of the nations gathered at the meeting  whichtraversed immense ocean barriers. The restraining pull ofnational interests and cultural differences are allharmonized — fine-tuned  so to speak — into a single seaof unity. It is through this unity that seeminglyinsurmountable obstacles or intractable problems can beresolved. In deliberating on and reviewing their respectiveperformances together and charting the way towards aprosperous and secure future for the region  the Forumleaders gave deeper meaning to the theme of this year’ssession.I wish to make some remarks about the outcome ofthose discussions. Climate change is a global problem that5requires a global solution. The Forum has again highlightedits concern over climate change and called for urgent actionin view of the second assessment report of theIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  which statesthat the balance of scientific evidence suggests a discerniblehuman influence on the global climate. This report hasgiven us much to be concerned about  and the Forumcountries call on the international community to acceleratenegotiations at the next conference of the parties.The international community needs to achievesignificant progress towards the goal of loweringgreenhouse gas emissions in the near future. The survivalof many small island developing States  as well as manyother developing States that are adversely affected in someway by climate change depends upon our taking action. Wewill all be adversely affected by climate change. For thisreason we reaffirm our full support for the alliance of smallisland States protocol in the context of the discussions ofthe Ad Hoc Group on the Berlin Mandate  which calls forstronger carbon dioxide reductions in a time-boundframework.During this session of the General Assembly we willreview progress on a number of related issues under theUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea including fisheries conservation and management andefforts to reduce the incidence of illegal fishing practices.We will also reiterate the importance that our region hasplaced on the effectiveness of an international legal regimefor oceans and their resources  including  in our view providing adequate financial resources to the InternationalSeabed Authority in Kingston  Jamaica.The Forum leaders underscored the importance thatthe Pacific fish stocks have for international trade and ourlivelihood. We recognize that this important resource mustbe managed sustainably to maximize its benefits to ourregion. In this connection  the Forum leaders haverequested our regional experts to develop comprehensiveagreements for the sustainable management of the region’sfisheries across the full geographical range of the stocks including the high seas  taking into account the Agreementon straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocksopened for signature here in New York last year. TheRepublic of the Marshall Islands has offered to host asecond High-level Multilateral Consultation on theConservation and Management of Fisheries Resources ofthe Central Western Pacific next year to advance thisprocess. This ministerial meeting will discuss a number ofissues  including restocking  greater involvement of thedistant-water-fishing nations in conservation andmanagement  data gathering on the range of the stocks and transshipments.The Forum leaders are also committed to the reviewand appraisal of Agenda 21  which will take place at thespecial session of the General Assembly next year.Mechanisms have been established for regional dialogue partnership and participation in the development ofconcrete proposals for action regarding the progress madesince the United Nations Conference on Environment andDevelopment in 1992. The Forum has asked its AdvisoryCommittee to coordinate these tasks and makepreparations to submit reports to that special session. Inthis respect I wish to call on our development partners tosupport the efforts of the Forum countries and ourregional organizations  so that the special session will bea thorough and comprehensive review. But in this regard we caution against a proliferation of organizations andmeetings when the concerted efforts of the internationalcommunity should be focused on practical measures which will improve on the efforts under way at theregional level. It is problematic for our administrations with limited resources  to cover too many meetingsdealing with the same topics  and we fear thatunnecessary duplication may occur as a result.We will report to that session on a number ofinitiatives  following on from the report submitted to theCommission on Sustainable Development in 1996 by theSouth Pacific Regional Environmental Programme(SPREP). In our region we recognize the importance ofthe multiple role that forests have  and the need for acomprehensive approach by the international communityto the sustainable management and conservation of alltypes of forests. For our part in sustainable forestsmanagement  the Forum endorsed a South Pacific Codeof Conduct for Logging of Indigenous Forests in selectedSouth Pacific Forum countries. Also  in the light of thefact that 1997 will be the Year of the Coral Reef in thePacific  we hope to include progress reports on theimplementation of coastal-zone-management strategies.The international community took steps at theBarbados Conference to acknowledge the special situationand interests of small island developing States. We stressthe need to give particular attention to the comprehensiveProgramme of Action produced at that Conference  and tohave the special needs of small island developing Statesadequately addressed in the United Nations developmentefforts. In its review of Agenda 21 the special session6should lay the grounds for further international cooperation national and regional initiative  and the mobilization ofresources for meeting the sustainable development needs ofsmall island developing States.I wish to raise some of issues of political significancefor our region. The Forum commended progress by Franceand parties in New Caledonia on the implementation of theMatignon Agreements. It welcomed the recent receptionaccorded to the Ministerial Mission from the Forumcountries by the French and New Caledonian authorities.Forum countries encourage all parties to continue dialoguein the search for a durable solution to the question of theterritory’s long-term future.I wish to inform the General Assembly that the Forumhas reaffirmed its strong and unanimous support forAustralia’s candidature for the Security Council in thisyear’s election. Furthermore  in recognition of theimportance of Japan as a constructive partner for the region the Forum also expressed strong and unanimous support forthe candidature of Japan at the same election.The Forum expressed satisfaction at the permanentcessation of French nuclear testing in the South Pacific.This marked the end of all nuclear testing in a region thathad been subjected to both atmospheric and undergroundtesting for five decades. China’s recent announcement of amoratorium on nuclear testing meant that all five nuclear-weapon States were now observing testing moratoriumslong urged by the Forum. Earlier this month the GeneralAssembly took action to adopt and open for signature acomprehensive test-ban Treaty (CTBT). This was an effortfully supported by the Forum  and the resolution wassponsored by all the United Nations members of the Forum.We are pleased with the passage of resolution 50/78  andurge all States to join with us in signing and ratifying theCTBT as soon as possible  to facilitate the Treaty’s earliestimplementation.We should recall the Advisory Opinion tendered bythe International Court of Justice on the legality of thethreat or use of nuclear weapons  which recognized that allmembers of the international community have an obligationto pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusionnegotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all itsaspects under strict and effective international control. TheForum leaders urged all States concerned  particularly thenuclear-weapon States  to continue meaningful negotiationswith a view to further significant reductions of nuclearstockpiles in the near future as a step towards the ultimateelimination of nuclear weapons.They also warmly welcomed the signature andratification by Vanuatu of the South Pacific Nuclear-FreeZone Treaty  the signature of Tonga  and the signing ofthe protocols to the Treaty by France  the UnitedKingdom and the United States of America. As a resultof these developments  all States within the Treaty areahave now given their support to the Treaty  and all fivenuclear-weapon States have undertaken to respect itsprovisions. We welcome the ratification by France of theprotocols. The Forum also urged early ratification of theprotocols by the United Kingdom and the United Statesof America.The Forum leaders were encouraged by theestablishment since their last meeting of two nuclear-weapon-free zones: in South-East Asia and Africa.Leaders noted with satisfaction that these developmentsrepresented progress with respect to the decisionsaccompanying the indefinite extension in 1995 of theTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Inthis context  Forum leaders expressed support for anappropriate resolution at this session of the UnitedNations General Assembly whereby signatory States ofthe southern hemisphere nuclear-weapon-free-zone treatiesand other members of the international community couldaffirm their support for these zones and cooperate in thefurtherance of the goals of these zones and of nuclearnon-proliferation and disarmament.The Forum again reaffirmed the existence of aspecial responsibility towards those peoples of the formerUnited Nations Trust Territory administered by the UnitedStates  the Marshall Islands  which was adversely affectedas a result of nuclear-weapon tests conducted during theperiod of the trusteeship. This responsibility includes thesafe resettlement of displaced human populations and therestoration to economic productivity of affected areas.The Forum wishes again to raise concerns overshipments of plutonium and radioactive wastes throughour region. These shipments must be carried out inaccordance with the strictest international safety andsecurity standards. All contingencies must be fullyaddressed  and full consultation must be carried out withthe countries of the regions through which the shipmentswill occur.I now wish to make some comments on behalf ofmy national delegation.In regard to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-BanTreaty (CTBT)  it is important that countries that were7severely affected by nuclear testing play a role in the 51-member Executive Council being envisaged within theCTBT framework to oversee all aspects of theimplementation of the Treaty. I wish to reiterate that theRepublic of the Marshall Islands stands ready to present itscandidacy for that Council  once established.We are grateful to President Clinton and hisAdministration for their transparent policy of disclosingpreviously classified information relating to the nuclear-testing programme in the Marshall Islands. We also wish tothank our friends and supporters in the United StatesCongress for their assistance. We hope that our cooperationcontinues to improve and that the process of disclosure isaccelerated. All the information pertaining to the nuclear-testing programme should be provided to my Government in order that we may fully comprehend the implications forour planning for the health and well-being of our citizensand our environment.The Government of the Republic of the MarshallIslands has recently learned that the damage caused bynuclear-weapon-test programmes during the trusteeship isfar greater and more horrible than originally disclosed. Theradiation released by all 67 nuclear-weapon tests iscurrently known to affect more atolls and more groups ofpeople than previously disclosed  as reported by the WhiteHouse Advisory Committee on Human RadiationExperiments. The health  environment  medical  social andeconomic consequences resulting from the effects of theradiation released remains a major concern for theGovernment of the Republic of the Marshall Islands. As aresult  at our current level of knowledge the costs related tothe effects of radiation make it very hard to properly treatand care for the people who have  and continue to show radiation-related illnesses. This also applies to programmesrelated to the rehabilitation of contaminated islands and thesafe resettlement of affected communities.We cannot solve these problems on our own  and wefeel obliged to appeal to the international community. Ourconcern continues to be that our situation has not been fullyaddressed and rectified until now. We welcome the newwillingness of the United States authorities to constructivelywork with the Republic of the Marshall Islands to addressthe full range of outstanding nuclear issues  which have forso long affected our relationship and the well-being of ourpeople. We acknowledge the assistance that has beenprovided up to now  which includes efforts at clean-up andresettlement. But much more needs to be done.We reiterate the call that was made to the High-levelOpen-ended Working Group of the General Assembly onthe Financial Situation of the United Nations to reducethe so-called floor rate in the scale of assessments. Thisis an issue of vital importance to all developing countrieswith small economies  in particular a large number ofsmall island developing States and least developedcountries. The situation was firmly noted by theCommittee on Contributions in its last report:“the current floor assessment rate of 0.01 per centresulted in a serious departure from the principle ofcapacity to pay for a number of smaller MemberStates.” (A/50/11/Add.2  para. 50)We call on the Fifth Committee to take action onthis matter as soon as possible  and the time for this hascome at this session of the General Assembly. In ourview  this would have a beneficial effect for over 60countries.Another area of reform that is of great concern to usis the expansion of the Security Council. The need for amore democratic process and for allowing greaterparticipation in the work of the Council is something thatwe all reaffirmed during the fiftieth-anniversary session.However  we have to make more progress inimplementing our ideas in this regard.This will be a very important year for the UnitedNations in that we will take stock of many of our currentactivities and lay the groundwork for many others. AsChair of the South Pacific Forum  the Republic of theMarshall Islands will spare no effort to ensure asuccessful conclusion to this year’s agenda. The Republicof the Marshall Islands has been an active participant inthis Assembly in the five years that we have been amember. We have come a long way since the adoption ofour Constitution in 1979. We pledge our cooperation tothe President’s leadership and we look forward toworking closely with him and the members of the GeneralAssembly."
"111",4581,"MKD",51,1996,"﻿It is an honour for me toaddress the fifty-first session of the General Assembly ofthe United Nations  confident that it will make yet anotherpositive contribution to the advancement of world peaceand cooperation among nations and countries of the world.The current international political and securitysituation is burdened with many crises  cases of blatantviolation of international law  the uncontrolled hoarding ofarms  upsets of the ecological balance  disrespect for humanrights  widespread international terrorism  and tensions ineconomic and social development. Such developmentshave confronted the United Nations with the need toreform its system in order to preserve its ability to carryout its functions. This is especially so in the case of theplans that should determine global development in thetwenty-first century  alleviate existing gaps in theeconomic and social development of countries andregions  and advance world peace.The subject of the expansion of the Security Councilis undoubtedly one that should receive priority treatmentat this session. In view of the changed structure of theinternational community and the growing role of theSecurity Council in recent years  and of the need forfurther democratization of the decision-making process asregards global peace and security  the conditions forexpansion seem ripe. The Republic of Macedonia isactively taking part in the activities of the Working Groupon the Question of Equitable Representation on andIncrease in the Membership of the Security Council. Webelieve that the proposal for including the FederalRepublic of Germany and Japan as permanent membersof the Security Council  as well as the expansion of thenumber of rotating members is realistic and deservesspecial attention. At the same time  other constructive andcomplementary approaches in circulation should also bekept in mind. If necessary  the Republic of Macedonia isprepared to make an individual proposal in this respectwith a view to overcoming any possible delay in theresolution of this issue.Wishing to make a constructive and active contributionto the work of the United Nations  the Republic ofMacedonia has submitted its candidacy for rotatingmembership in the Security Council for the 1998-1999term. We are convinced that our demeanour during andfollowing the dissolution of the former Socialist FederalRepublic of Yugoslavia  the constructive and peacefulpolicy we have upheld  our acknowledged position as afactor of stability in the Balkans  our commitment to itsEuropeanization and our activities within the UnitedNations to date will be a sufficient basis and guarantee forsecuring the support of United Nations Members for ourcandidacy. I wish to assure them that we will fully justifythe confidence they bestow.From the very onset of our independence  the Republicof Macedonia  the only one of the former Yugoslavrepublics to achieve independence peacefully  hasdistinguished itself as an example of a country whoseleverage in the international community and whose foreignpolicy are founded on consistent respect for the principlesof the United Nations  a readiness to cooperate withneighbouring and other countries and to resolve all openissues in a peaceful manner on the basis of mutual respect the inviolability of borders and non-interference in theinternal affairs of other countries.Led by these commitments  the Republic ofMacedonia submitted two resolutions for good-neighbourlyrelations among the Balkan countries. They were sponsoredby more than 30 countries and adopted unanimously  withthe aim of undertaking measures and preventive action thatwill create a stable zone of peace and cooperation in theBalkans by the end of the year 2000. In accordance withthe resolutions  the Republic of Macedonia will be the hostof a high-level international meeting of the Balkan countriesin January next year  dedicated to the advancement ofstability in the region.Led by the principles of the United Nations  last yearthe Republic of Macedonia signed the Interim Accord withthe Republic of Greece within the framework of thenegotiations held under United Nations auspices. Thepositive results of this Accord are already evident. We areconfident of the prospects for good and friendly relationsbetween our countries and that we will reconcile theremaining differences.The level of democratization we have achieved  ourreforms aimed at adapting the economy to marketmechanisms  and our high human-rights standards confirmour intentions of becoming fully integrated intointernational and regional economic and securitystructures. Today  the Republic of Macedonia is a full-fledged member of the Council of Europe  the oldestEuropean political organization  and the Organization forSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). It is apartner in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s“Partnership for Peace”. It has also concluded acooperation agreement with the European Union  withprospects for closer association and membership in theUnion.The peace-keeping forces of the United Nations thatcomprise the United Nations Preventive DeploymentForce (UNPREDEP) in the Republic of Macedonia haveset the precedent for the United Nations successfulinvolvement in the concept of preventive diplomacy. Theyhave clearly demonstrated the justification and merit ofthis concept. We have a very high regard for the role thatUNPREDEP plays in the preservation of peace andsecurity in the Republic of Macedonia and the region.Consequently  and in view of the existing and potentialthreats to peace in the region  we have already requestedan extension of the UNPREDEP mandate for anadditional six months.The region in which my country is situated  theBalkans  is one of the most sensitive in Europe. It ispresently in the midst of the so-called “post-Dayton”era encompassing the process of bringing to life thefragile peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina  thenormalization of relationships among countries and theopening of prospects for development and cooperation inthe region. In this context  the Republic of Macedonia  asa peaceful country oriented towards Europe  remainssteadfast in its policy  especially in terms of resolving theeconomic and social problems it is facing as a country intransition and particularly with regard to the rights ofnational minorities as a precondition not only fordemocratization and security in Macedonia  but also forwider security in the southern Balkans. The Republic ofMacedonia has opted for the model of respect for humanand minority rights and for the implementation ofinternational standards pertaining to the rights of nationalminorities. This is guaranteed by the firm provisions ofthe Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia andthrough its legislative and political practice. We remaindeeply convinced that  in the ethnically inter-mixedBalkans  the guaranteed rights of national minorities arethe most important long-term factor for stable peace andcooperation. This is why we have proposed the idea of acomparative study regarding national- minority rights inthe Balkans that will enable much more efficient action to2be taken by such international institutions as the OSCE  theCouncil of Europe and most certainly the United Nations.Allow me to conclude my address by expressing myconviction that a vision of the world in the twenty-firstcentury as one of peace  democracy and well-being willprompt all of us and the United Nations to act withpersistence and determination. It is my hope that thedecisions and the direction set out by this year’s GeneralAssembly will be a step towards that goal."
"112",4627,"MLI",51,1996,"﻿Allow me to begin by expressing  on behalf of thedelegation of the Republic of Mali  heartfeltcongratulations to the President on his election to lead thefifty-first regular session of the General Assembly. Hiselection reflects the trust and esteem he enjoys in thisOrganization because of his great diplomatic skills and hisvast experience of international relations. While this is anhonour for him  it also honours his country  Malaysia  afriend of my country’s and one that plays an importantrole in international affairs  particularly within the Non-Aligned Movement.I am therefore convinced that the President willconduct the business of the fifty-first session in acompetent and well-advised manner. He can certainlycount on the support of the Republic of Mali to contributeto the success of his mission. Allow me also to thank hispredecessor  Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral  for theoutstanding work he accomplished during his term ofoffice. Finally  I should like  on behalf of my delegation to pay well-deserved homage to the Secretary-General His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for hiscourageous action and tireless efforts for peace andunderstanding among peoples.The end of the cold war gave the peoples of theworld cause to hope for the advent of a new era markedby the promotion of more stable and balancedinternational relations. To this end  the internationalcommunity must mobilize to find just and lastingsolutions to the many hotbeds of tension and conflict thatjeopardize international peace and security.In this respect  Mali welcomes the qualitativedevelopment of the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina.We welcome the holding of elections on 14 September which marked a decisive stage for the future of thecountry. We exhort the international community to workto preserve and consolidate this newly restored peace.We likewise welcome the possibilities that arose atthe latest Economic Community of West African States(ECOWAS) summit in Liberia for a settlement based on24national reconciliation and the restoration of democraticallyelected institutions. Mali has worked steadfastly to find asolution to the crisis in Liberia and is prepared to makeavailable a battalion to the ECOWAS Monitoring Group(ECOMOG).Likewise  Mali supports the efforts undertaken by theinternational community to assist the people of Burundi toestablish a lasting peace and national reconciliation. Malialso supports United Nations efforts to establish a just andlasting peace in Angola.The international community must do everythingpossible in Somalia to help bring about reconciliation andthe establishment of national institutions that are supportedand trusted by all Somalis.Recent developments on the question of WesternSahara require that our Organization work even moreintensively towards the holding of a referendum  in keepingwith the relevant resolutions adopted on the matter.Mali has always reaffirmed its support forinternational law and is concerned at the continuedsanctions imposed on Libya  which have compounded thesufferings of the Libyan people  with whom my countryreiterates it solidarity.Like other countries in the international community Mali is seriously concerned over recent developments in thesituation in the Middle East. My country remains convincedthat in order to settle the Israeli-Arab conflict  there is noalternative to the possibilities offered by the Madrid PeaceConference. Mali therefore calls for the continuation of thepeace process and for compliance with the commitmentspreviously undertaken.To promote more stable and balanced internationalrelations  the present mechanisms for the consolidation ofpeace need to be strengthened; but we also need to findnew tools. The Agenda for Peace opens new possibilities inthis area.Accordingly  Mali welcomed the adoption of theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty as a historic stagein the strengthening of general and complete disarmament.We likewise welcomed the adoption on 11 April 1996 ofthe Pelindaba Treaty  which made Africa a nuclear-weapon-free zone. My country also hopes that further progressmight be made to eliminate anti-personnel mines.Mali has demonstrated its commitment tostrengthening the process of general and completedisarmament through specific national and internationalinitiatives. Accordingly  in 1994  the President of theRepublic of Mali  His Excellency Mr. Alpha OumarKonaré  requested and obtained special assistance fromthe Secretary-General of the United Nations to establisha consultative mission responsible for studying ways andmeans to stem the proliferation of small arms in theSahelo-Saharan region. Indeed  our countries  which arenot arms producers  have become lucrative markets forthe war industry. Where did these weapons come from?What are their transit points? An answer to thesequestions  in my delegation’s view  would make itpossible to find ways and means to guarantee that thepeople of the affected countries enjoy a safe environmentconducive to pursuing development.Besides the support of other countries in the Sahelo-Saharan region  Mali’s initiative was also backed by otherregions during the forty-ninth and fiftieth sessions of theGeneral Assembly  namely through the adoption ofresolutions 49/75 G and 50/70 H. Mali’s initiative helpedgive rise to our Organization’s now-famous concept ofmicro-disarmament  which seeks to draw the attention ofthe international community to the disastrousconsequences of small weapons  particularly in thedeveloping countries  where they are used mostly to fuelconflicts.A better-structured and more united internationalorder seems today to be the very precondition forinternational peace and security. Development is one ofthe major challenges that our Organization must meettoday. As Pope Paul VI has stressed “Development is another word for peace.”Thus  in order to establish the basis for a lasting peace the problems of poverty  destitution and socialmarginalization must therefore be given priority at theUnited Nations.I should like in this respect to stress the greatimportance Mali attaches to the drafting of an Agenda forDevelopment  the indispensable counterpart to the Agendafor Peace. This entails the organization of internationalcooperation for development on a new basis  an area inwhich my country is working with resolve. The role ofthe United Nations system in the development processalso must be strengthened.25In this connection  the Agenda for Development —which my delegation hopes will be adopted at this sessionof the General Assembly — will make it possible torefocus the world’s attention on cooperation fordevelopment  particularly by encouraging new  morecomplete and more effective approaches to development. Itcould also provide a way to strengthen coordination withinthe United Nations system  particularly by recognizing theOrganization as a network of institutions responsible for theeconomic and social development of the Member States.In this respect  because of the persistent foreign-debtcrisis of the countries of the South and the dwindling ofofficial development assistance  the question ofdevelopment financing requires special attention.The Agenda for Development should likewise takeinto account the recommendations contained in the Plans ofAction adopted by the United Nations Conference onEnvironment and Development  held in Rio de Janeiro; theInternational Conference on Population and Development held in Cairo; the World Summit for Social Development held in Copenhagen; the Fourth World Conference onWomen  held in Beijing; and the second United NationsConference on Human Settlements  held in Istanbul.The Agenda for Development clearly must give specialattention to Africa. The socio-economic situation of ourcontinent is indeed of great concern. Africa  which isconfronting all kinds of epidemic and endemic diseases —including malaria and AIDS — has only one doctor forevery 18 000 people  as compared to one doctor for fewerthan 400 people in developed countries. More than 80million school-age African children do not have access toprimary or secondary education. More than one third ofAfrica’s population suffers from famine  and more than 23million children are malnourished. Finally  Africa is reelingfrom an external debt that in 1995 was estimated to be$322 billion  the debt servicing of which absorbs more thanone third of its export earnings.Given this situation  in an increasingly interdependentworld  the international community must show solidaritywith Africa. That is why a solidarity pact between Africaand the rest of the international community was sealed withthe adoption of the United Nations New Agenda for theDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s. As we know  underthe terms of this New Agenda  Africa solemnly reaffirmsthat Africans themselves are primarily responsible for theeconomic and social development of the continent  whilethe international community undertakes to support Africa’sefforts in attaining its development objectives.Commendable efforts have been made by Africancountries in implementing this New Agenda. In thepolitical and economic spheres  in particular  these havebeen achieved by consolidating the democratic process  bypromoting investments and by taking account ofenvironmental and population problems in developmentpolicies. Mali has thus established a policy for economicrecovery and improved public financing. Macro-economicgoals  on the whole  have been attained.A broad range of structural measures has beenimplemented through price liberalization; privatization;the elimination or restructuring of many publicenterprises; and the reform of the agricultural sector  witha view to reducing costs and to increasing anddiversifying production. These tangible results enabledMali in February 1996 to conclude a new three-yearagreement for the period 1996-1998 in the framework ofthe Reinforced Structural Adjustment Facility.Mindful of the need to accompany the promotion ofeconomic growth with resolute efforts in the socialdomain to improve significantly the living standards ofpeoples and to reduce poverty permanently  myGovernment has expanded social services. In addition priority in socio-economic development programmes hasbeen given to women.Since 26 March 1991  Mali has continued its steadyprogress towards consolidating its regained peace andbuilding a State based on the rule of law. The qualitativedevelopments that have taken place in Mali’s northernregions show clearly the determination of Mali’s youngdemocracy to tackle and resolve all problems in aconcerted and peaceful way  with the active participationof all players and with scrupulous respect for humanrights and fundamental freedoms.The organization of the “Flame of Peace” ceremonywas an eloquent illustration of this. It was a symbolicceremony to destroy the stockpiles of several thousandweapons that were surrendered by ex-combatants of theMouvement et Fronts Unis de l’Azawad and theMouvement Patriotique Malien Ganda Koy. It took placeon 27 March 1996 in Timbuktu under the presidency ofthe Head of State of Mali  His Excellency Mr. AlphaOumar Konaré  and in the presence of the President ofthe Republic of Ghana  the current President of ECOWASand several ministerial delegations of Mali’s neighbouringcountries. The United Nations  which contributed to thepeace efforts through the Department of Political Affairsand the United Nations Development Programme as well26as to the small-arms collection process  was alsorepresented by an important delegation.During that ceremony the Mouvement et Fronts Unisde l’Azawad and the Mouvement Patriotique Malien GandaKoy issued a joint declaration under which they“solemnly and irreversibly proclaim the dissolution oftheir respective movements and fronts”.These positive developments in northern Mali meanthat real prospects now exist for integration and socio-economic development in the region. We therefore appealto the international community to support the efforts of theGovernment of Mali to consolidate democracy in thecountry; to continue to strengthen the peace that has beenestablished with the participation of the country’s variouscommunities; and to show its solidarity concretely  byproviding the necessary humanitarian assistance to meet theneeds of returning refugees and to help promote theirreintegration.It is thus important to undertake urgent work todevelop the regions concerned by  inter alia  reintegratingdisplaced peoples  restoring our administration  boostingagricultural production and improving the functioning ofpublic services  in particular in the areas of education health and justice.I take this opportunity to urgently appeal to Mali’sdevelopment partners quickly and effectively to implementthis programme  which  in the long run  aims atdevelopment within a State based on a strengthened rule oflaw and on democracy and human rights. Respect for therule of law is of major importance to Mali’s ThirdRepublic  which makes the promotion and defence ofhuman rights one of its priorities.In this connection I should also note theinstitutionalization  which has now been going on for twoyears  of the Space for Democratic Discourse  whichenables individuals  civil society and political parties tomake direct and public appeals to the Government on 10December every year with regard to the respect of humanrights in Mali. We likewise have institutionalized achildren’s parliament  which provides a forum for the freeexpression of Mali’s children to assist the public authoritiesin implementing the national plan of action for the survival development and protection of children.Mali — one of the six countries that initiated theWorld Summit for Children in 1990 — welcomed thecommemorative meeting held on 30 September 1996 toreview the progress made and to give thought to theadditional steps that need to be taken on behalf ofchildren.The consolidation of Mali’s young democracyrequires also the harmonious organization of relationsbetween civilians and the military. With the support of theUnited Nations  the Government of Mali held a seminaron this subject last July. A code of good conduct is beingdrafted in this connection.I should like to underscore here  simply butforcefully  the importance Mali attaches to human rights in particular the rights of women and children. We areconvinced that the role played by our Organization mustbe backed up by concrete actions that stress the right toeducation  health and life.The international economic situation clearly showsthat the gap between developed and developing countriesis widening. By generating an increase in inequalities andin the risk of social upheavals  this imbalance is makingthe future of the world increasingly uncertain. Given thesituation  the international community must find adequatesolutions.It is imperative that we find an answer to theexternal debt problem of the countries of the South. Inspite of the progress made in this area  relief measures fordebt servicing remain insufficient. My delegationtherefore makes an urgent appeal that the ongoingdiscussions at the current meetings of the World Bankand the International Monetary Fund on the creation of aspecial fund aimed at considerably reducing themultilateral debt of poor countries under structuraladjustment result in a successful outcome.My delegation deeply appreciates the importantextension of $500 million  intended to reduce the debt ofAfrican countries  made by the Group of Seven majorindustrialized countries last June at their summit meetingin Lyons. This is an encouraging sign and an example tofollow.It is just as important to support the efforts of theAfrican countries to diversify their economies and therange of their commodities. It is also necessary to reversethe current trend towards disinvestment and dwindlingfinancial resources destined for Africa.27We should facilitate the access of African products toworld markets  particularly by lifting the tariff and non-tariff barriers that affect its finished  semi-finished andmanufactured goods. They should also receive preferentialtreatment  as provided in the Final Act of the UruguayRound concluded in Marrakesh.Finally  the international community should give itsfull support to the Secretary-General’s United NationsSystem-wide Special Initiative for Africa so that it does notsuffer the same fate as the United Nations Programme ofAction for African Economic Recovery and Development.In addition to the critical economic and social situationin Africa  there is the problem of the least developedcountries. For this reason  my country appeals to theinternational community to implement urgently the UnitedNations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the1990s.Mali also welcomes the proclamation of 1996 as theInternational Year for the Eradication of Poverty. We hopethat the international community will achieve the goals ofthe first United Nations Decade for the Eradication ofPoverty.My country hopes that the next World Food Summit to be held in November in Rome  will make it possible forthe international community to reaffirm its commitment toensuring that poverty-eradication strategies are fullyintegrated into all United Nations initiatives.Mali has signed and ratified most internationalarrangements regarding the environment and thereforewelcomes the convening of a special session devoted to areview of the progress made by Agenda 21. Mali intends tocontinue to work towards the elaboration of the UnitedNations Convention to Combat Desertification in thoseCountries Experiencing Serious Drought and/orDesertification  particularly in Africa. Mali is thereforepleased at how fast the necessary ratification of 50 MemberStates was achieved. My delegation is neverthelessconcerned about the deadlock on the question of a worldmechanism. Mali believes that the mechanism should serveas a data bank and a supplier of the resources necessary toimplement national plans to combat desertification.Our Organization faces new challenges  both in theconsolidation of peace and in economic and socialdevelopment. Its role is constantly growing  and increasingnumbers of voices throughout the world appeal to it. Inorder to meet the challenges of the day  our Organizationmust have a sound and adequate financial basis. It mustalso carry out the necessary reforms so that it can bemore effective and thus meet the aspirations of peoplesfor security  justice and development. Accordingly  thesereforms must apply to the Security Council  the GeneralAssembly and the Secretariat  but particularly to thespecialized and development agencies responsible forelaborating and implementing development programmes.This is an ambitious challenge  and Africa mustcontribute significantly to efforts in that direction. Theinternational community must renew its trust in Africa bygiving a second term of office to the Head of ourOrganization  in keeping with past practice."
"113",4668,"MLT",51,1996,"﻿May I congratulate the Presidenton his new responsibilities and pay tribute to Mr. Freitasdo Amaral of Portugal. During last year’s jubilee session his persistence furthered this Assembly’s revitalizationprocess.Less than a year ago  world leaders met in this Hall tocommemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nationsand renew their commitment to the Charter. The worldcommunity rejoiced. Hope had survived the darkness of thecold war. Trust in the United Nations was  however tempered by an awareness of the difficulties threatening itssurvival and the aspirations of the peoples it represents.Could the Organization address the new phenomenon ofinstability which risked sapping its capacities andresources? What prevailed was a pragmatic assessment. Thealternatives to the United Nations were either that ofattempting to reinvent the wheel or scuttling this forum ofdialogue and cooperation to have arrogance and chaos usherin the new millennium.We  the peoples  can ill afford war. Rhetoric can nevercancel the grief and destruction it generates. The UnitedNations was founded to save succeeding generations fromthis scourge. Notwithstanding the then-widespreadcolonialism and the angst of bipolarism  the worldcommunity worked to contain the risk of war. As theability to destroy grew  so did the potential of States to beannihilated. Brave  bold steps required clear vision and acommitment to peace. The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  extended indefinitelylast year  is a monumental landmark in this arduous quest.The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty is anothermilestone. Malta co-sponsored the resolution that led toits adoption by the General Assembly and is honoured tohave been amongst its first signatories.The challenge remains. We must generate broaderconfidence to ensure universal adherence and complianceto these treaties and others  including the ChemicalWeapons Convention. Procrastination in their ratificationby the States that matter most could expose them to thedanger of becoming dead letters. Malta welcomes thecommitment expressed by President Clinton of the UnitedStates of America in this regard.The risk of world conflict  though remote  is stillpresent. The total horror of a nuclear holocaust induces anin-built restraint. This is not the case with conventionalarmaments or weapons of mass destruction. Millions ofvictims of local and regional conflicts — be they dead maimed  refugees  displaced  widowed or orphaned —continue to torment the conscience of humankind. Thesetragedies spur us to pursue initiatives which fostersecurity and confidence. The call for a ban on theproduction  export and use of anti-personnel landmineshas Malta’s full support. The seven-point programme ofaction proposed by the Foreign Minister Kinkel ofGermany provides a good basis for progress.We must melt the bastions of suspicion. Only aconsolidated regime of confidence-building anddisarmament measures can buttress belief in andcommitment to the peaceful settlement of disputes. Thisprocess requires regional and international concertedaction. Malta has been active in promoting security andcooperation in the Mediterranean. Malta and France haveboth made proposals for a stability pact for theMediterranean. The sharing of concerns among countriesafflicted by common problems can help overcome them.This and other initiatives could turn our sea of turmoilinto one of mutual trust.Malta’s foreign policy is both inspired anddependent on the notion of regional stability. It continues15to sustain our efforts at greater Mediterranean cooperation.It inspired our proposal to have the Conference on Securityand Cooperation in Europe declare itself a regionalarrangement in terms of Chapter VIII of the United NationsCharter.The enlargement of the European Union  of whichMalta expects to become a full member in the near future provides a unique dimension of the process of regionalcooperation. Malta welcomes the statement made by DeputyPrime Minister Spring of Ireland on behalf of the EuropeanUnion. It reflects the common values which have alwaysinspired the European process and led to the consolidationof democracy  prosperity  social justice and solidarity. Inthe framework of the structured dialogue  Malta has workedwith its European Union partners on key issues to promotepeaceful coexistence  cooperation  development andprogress within the world community.Malta supports the Euro-Mediterranean partnership.Cooperation in the political  security  economic andfinancial areas cannot but yield results. Social  cultural andhuman relations are other important aspects of thispartnership. Malta has always seen its application formembership of the European Union in terms thatencompass the economic and the broader politicaldimensions. The successful outcome of the negotiations onMalta’s accession  due to start in the coming months  willfurther strengthen our contribution.Interlocking institutions of the European securityarchitecture  such as the Organization for Security andCooperation in Europe  the Partnership for Peace and theCouncil of Europe  have strengthened the distinct areas ofcooperation on which security depends. We must identifyand combat threats to peace as they emerge.We have witnessed the horror of intolerance based onnationality  race  creed or political belief. Agonizingconflicts and acts of terrorism have shattered lives andtrampled upon the rights and dignity of whole populations.Such events have shocked us into action. Theestablishment of the ad hoc Tribunals and the currentnegotiations on the establishment of an internationalcriminal court  which Malta fully supports  are proof of thevaried manner in which the United Nations responds to newneeds.The road to peace  through the compromise ofnegotiated settlement  is not always immediate or popular.Yet  it is the only path. Reconciliation does not happen ofits own accord. It requires courage and leaders whostretch out their hand to their adversaries and build  brickby brick  the edifice of stability.The universally acclaimed processes which rekindledthe hope of settlement in Bosnia and Herzegovina and theMiddle East are parts of this noble task.The implementation of agreements reached betweenIsrael and the Palestine Liberation Organization  theresumption of negotiations and the full realization of theinalienable rights of the Palestinian people areindispensable for stability in the Middle East. Theinternational community must continue to assist thisprocess. Malta welcomes the first meeting between PrimeMinister Netanyahu and President Arafat. The most recentincidents of violence in Jerusalem and Ramallah in recentdays give rise to great concern. The momentum ofachievement should not be dissipated by acts which erodethe confidence built thus far.The people of Cyprus have thirsted for peace andunity for too long and also deserve the attainment of ajust and long-lasting settlement.In this Hall  recognition was always and exclusivelyreserved for peacemakers. It was never bestowed onwarmongers  aggressors or cynics who constantly doubtand discourage others from building hope.The United Nations Children’s Fund  the Office ofthe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees  theWorld Health Organization  the Food and AgricultureOrganization of the United Nations  the United NationsDevelopment Programme and United Nations actions inPalestine  Namibia  Cambodia and Mozambique are partof this Organization’s history in contributing towards thewell-being and development of peoples  peacekeeping andpeace-building. The success achieved should not berobbed of merit by instances where it is lacking. Are notthe Blue Helmets across the globe a signal ofengagement? Are not negotiations on preventivediplomacy a commitment to addressing the root causes oftension and conflict? Are not our deliberations ondevelopment means to create stability and well-being atthe local level?In 50 years  we have created a range of tools topromote cooperation. True enough  our tools needperfecting. We must calibrate them to current realities.Tools  however  need to be used. A shed full of perfect but unused  tools never provided any farmer with a16livelihood. Only the will to operate tools and invest energywhere it matters helps to reap the fruit.The future demands a more action-oriented approach:more time in the field  rather than pondering in the shed.This resolve inspires us as we follow up the United Nationsconferences on the environment  human rights  population social development  women’s rights and human settlements.The World Food Summit is another example of action.Renewed focus on development has led to variousinitiatives  including those specific to Africa. Partnershipsforged by the European Union and Japan with thedeveloping world reflect active cooperative involvement.Achievement registered by a number of developing Statesunderlines the benefit of such undertakings. The dialogueinstituted between Non-Aligned Movement  the Group of77 and the Group of Seven is an important and welcomestep.Malta’s academic institutions  in collaboration withUnited Nations agencies and the Commonwealth secretariat annually sponsor and organize a number of trainingprogrammes. Most fall into the category of the training oftrainers. Students from the developing world and fromcountries with economies in transition have attended short-or long-term courses and are now back in their countriesdirectly contributing to development.Malta  through its Government and non-governmentalorganizations  regularly donates funds for a number ofhumanitarian and overseas development aid programmes.These initiatives  together with the traditional involvementof Maltese teachers and social workers in the developingworld as volunteers from non-governmental organizationsor members of religious orders  symbolize our nationalcommitment to international solidarity.We view our collective achievements with pride. Eachconvention and treaty agreed upon by the internationalcommunity is a testimonial of our common will to build abetter life  each a symbol of our resolve to beat our swordsinto ploughshares. Yet  the anguished sea of faces ofmillions of children denied the right to hope still haunts us whether it is war  famine  or exploitation which generatesmisery. Our collective future can never be secure until thesechildren acquire the right to smile in hope and to their fairshare in the bounties of society.Cynicism and fatalism cannot cure us of social ills.Blended with hope  pragmatism yields reward. What ismore pragmatic than the care of the destitute to whichpeople like Mother Theresa dedicate their lives. Oneperson less going to bed with an empty stomach  oneperson less torn with pain  one person less deniedshelter — small pragmatic steps inspired by the innatedignity of each human being; acts of caring solidaritywhich each individual  each family  each community iscapable of; commitment to others generates hope. Eachounce of food which alleviates famine; each drop of waterwhich combats drought and desertification; each dose ofmedicine which contains the spread of disease; each bookwhich kindles knowledge helps build a better world.Democracy  the rule of law  free and fair electionsand constant vigilance in the promotion and protection ofhuman rights are the guarantors of peace. Internationalelection observer missions are an important contributionto confidence-building. Malta has participated in thisprocess  most recently in Palestine and Bosnia andHerzegovina.As much as action is instrumental  so is restraint.Emissions which pollute the environment; lumberingwhich depletes the rain forests; indiscriminate trawlingwhich exhausts our fishstocks — even if disguised aseconomic imperatives — undermine efforts towardssustainable development.Malta looks forward to this Assembly’s 1997 specialsession to follow up and update the Rio achievements.We have strategies and action plans. Now is the timefor dynamic engagement. Present and future generationsdemand that we use these instruments to combat drugtrafficking  illicit arms transfers  money laundering andorganized crime  which sap the life of the communitieswe built with so much effort.My Government is totally committed in this regard.Legislation adopted has strengthened the arm of the lawin apprehending traffickers  halting the flow of drugs andconfiscating illegal funds accrued. This determined policyis bearing fruit. Malta supports the convening of aGeneral Assembly special session in 1998comprehensively to address drug trafficking and relatedissues. Poland’s proposed convention to fight transnationalcrime has been noted with interest. Regional andinternational cooperation on these issues remains the keyto success.Our children have a right to a life free from fear ina safer world. That remains our responsibility as parentsand policy makers.17The United Nations is often accused of lacking in itsassigned role. Yet the United Nations is what MemberStates make of it. They decide on its future. United Nationsreform requires discipline in our operating methods. Wehave to discard self-imposed fetters and act with therevived spirit that our times demand.Tempered by the fires of conflict and the lessons ofthe League of Nations  the founding fathers built into theCharter a balance worth preserving. Reform should not bereduced to a simple juxtaposition of organizational charts.Only by revitalizing the spirit that gives our Organizationlife and purpose will we achieve the ideal of nations largeand small working in unison for a better world.As President of the General Assembly at its forty-fifthsession  in the immediate aftermath of the cold war  myDeputy Prime Minister  Mr. Guido de Marco  called forreflection and action to better the symbiotic relationshipbetween the United Nations principal organs. Since thenworking groups have been set up to discuss restructuring.Within the Security Council reform group  work hasevolved  but it is still far from reaching common ground.There is consensus that the Council should be expanded andbe more representative. The type of expansion and thecategories are still subject to a wide divergence of views.Malta looks forward to an expanded Security Council thatbest serves the world community. On the merits ofincreasing the Council’s permanent membership  we stillhave an open mind. The very nature of permanencedemands that we establish clear and exact criteria onrequired qualifications for present and future candidates.Giving due recognition to changes in internationalrelations and the nature and extent of the contribution ofStates towards tasks assigned to the Council  we must avoidrigid stances or those that may be construed as such. Thereare a number of compromise proposals that could help usfind a solution  even if temporarily. We have listened withgreat attention and positive interest to Foreign Minister Diniexplaining the Italian proposal as one which takes intoaccount both the special contribution of a number of Statesand the right of all States to serve on the Council regardlessof their size  wealth or military might.Only understandings between States that win theconfidence of all can assist us in surmounting existingobstacles. We are satisfied to note the consensus existing onbettering the important qualitative relationship between theSecurity Council and the General Assembly. Changesintroduced in the working methods of the Council are anindication of a universal positive disposition.The Open-ended High-level Working Group on theStrengthening of the United Nations system has registeredsignificant progress and tackled a variety of complexissues. Malta has consistently advocated greater efficiencyand a more effective role for the General Assembly todissipate negative perceptions that may exist.Responsibilities of this Assembly  of which we are allpermanent members  are many and varied. We havealready noted the benefits of streamlining. More isrequired. Our deliberations have an impact on publicopinion and political contingencies. We would be remissif indifference or bureaucratization were to numb us fromfully assuming the responsibilities and obligationsimposed by the Charter.Starting with the forty-fifth session  my DeputyPrime Minister has also called for a review of the role ofthe Trusteeship Council. Creating or abolishinginstitutions necessarily has an impact on the principles onwhich they are based. The balance characteristic of theCharter needs to be enhanced rather than diluted. TheUnited Nations should continue to cherish all principleson which it was founded  including the notion of trust  onwhich the Trusteeship Council rests.Last year  Malta submitted a resolution seeking theopinion of States on the Trusteeship Council’s future. Thediversity of views expressed is indicative of the existingpotential. Malta looks forward to further discussion on thesubject  confident in the will to better utilize existinginstitutions to serve the principles of the Charter. Ourcommon heritage and the welfare of future generationsdemand that in reorienting the United Nations wepreserve and protect the vision and ideals that gave itbirth.Thirty years ago Malta launched the concept ofcommon heritage. This concept has become ingrained inthe reality of the United Nations Convention on the Lawof the Sea and the International Sea-Bed Authority. Ittakes time for ideas to mature and consensus to emerge.The most recent development  which we welcome  is theInternational Tribunal for the Law of the Sea  to beinaugurated at Hamburg  Germany  next month. Thoseinstitutions will undoubtedly continue to contribute to theunderlying principle of trust in protecting and preservingour common heritage.18The financial crisis facing the Organization hasdampened hopes and discouraged many. Malta believes thatthe ongoing exercise of assessing costs  eliminating wasteand rationalizing structures must go on. Although pruningis essential to strengthen the United Nations  so also is theneed for all Member States to meet obligations and to paytheir assessed contributions to the regular and peacekeepingbudgets  in full  promptly and without conditions.Discussion on the scale of assessments will also contributeto improving the financial base of the Organization.“Bankruptcy” is an awful word. It is too oftenrepeated in relation to the United Nations. Finances areundoubtedly a cause of common concern. There is however  another threatening phenomenon which looms —moral bankruptcy. This is by far the greater danger and theone that we should fear most.With the end of the cold war  a second-generationUnited Nations had to find in its Member States the resolveand commitment to face winds of change that at timesassume the force of gales and whirlwinds. With a steadyhand on the rudder and our eyes fixed on that guiding starthat inspired the founding fathers  we can still bring ship toport. The fate of humankind is our precious cargo andresponsibility."
"114",4714,"MMR",51,1996,"﻿May I begin by extending toMr. Razali the warmest congratulations of the delegation ofthe Union of Myanmar on his most deserving election asPresident of the fifty-first session of the General Assembly.His election to that important office is no doubt a reflectionof the high esteem in which his country  Malaysia  is heldby the international community for its active role in worldaffairs  and of his wealth of personal experience anddiplomatic skills. We are confident that under hisleadership our deliberations will be fruitful. On a personalnote  I should like to say how deeply honoured I was tohave accompanied the Head of State Senior General ThanShwe on his state visit to Malaysia last month. The visitwas a success. We were much impressed by the warmreception accorded us and by the outstandingachievements of the leadership in bringing peace andprosperity to the people of Malaysia.I wish also to express our appreciation toMr. Razali’s predecessor  His Excellency Mr. DiogoFreitas do Amaral  for his invaluable contribution to thework of the fiftieth session of the General Assembly.The United Nations today is at a crossroads. On theone hand  there is hope for a new era in internationalrelations as post- cold-war trends compel nations towardsever-growing interdependence and the globalization of theworld economy. On the other hand  issues that have beendormant for decades have emerged  drawing the worldinto a pattern of conflict  ethnic strife and violence. Inthis time of global transformation the United Nations hasan important role to play. It must actively work to guidethe world through the transitional period to a new peaceful  secure and stable era based on respect for theCharter.In this United Nations Decade of International Lawit would be most appropriate to rededicate ourselves toachieving a world in which principles of sovereignty territorial integrity  independence  sovereign equality andnon-interference in the internal affairs of States arerespected. Myanmar truly believes that we can overcomethe political  economic and social challenges we face andavoid confrontation and chaos only if we seize theopportunity to extend and strengthen the Organization andpromote a multilateral system based on the primacy ofinternational law and freedom of choice and equality ofall States.Disarmament  sustainable development  enhancementof the environment and suppression of narcotic drugs arepriority issues that affect the security and well-being ofpeoples throughout the world. Concern continues tomount over the lack of adequate progress in these areas.The proliferation of arms  particularly of weapons of massdestruction  remains the greatest potential threat tomankind’s survival. All States  large and small  nuclearand non-nuclear  have a vital interest in ensuring thesuccess of negotiations on disarmament. The primaryresponsibility for removing the threat of a nuclear16holocaust  however  rests with the nuclear-weapon States.It is essential that the nuclear-weapon States show thepolitical will to accommodate the concerns of non-nuclear-weapon States to achieve a mutually acceptable basis foruniversal disarmament.Myanmar continues to regard a comprehensive test-bantreaty as an essential step towards nuclear disarmament.The adoption of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-BanTreaty (CTBT) by the General Assembly on 10 September1996 is a welcome development. It will contributesignificantly to the process of nuclear disarmament and toour efforts to achieve the goal of general and completedisarmament.Myanmar has always supported the establishment ofnuclear-free zones. In our own region we have  togetherwith our neighbours  signed and ratified the South EastAsia Nuclear Weapon-Free Zone Treaty. Peace and securityin the world need to be built upon economic development.Without development there can be no lasting peace. It mustbe realized  however  that economic progress in developingcountries depends as much on a fair and equitableinternational economic environment as it does on domesticreforms to effectively confront the challenge of poverty andeconomic malaise. In this regard  we share the Secretary-General’s view that development should be recognized asthe foremost and most far-reaching task of our time. At thesame time  we are deeply concerned that the process ofglobalization of the world economy has yielded many morelosers than winners. The situation was most eloquentlydescribed by the Chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement President Samper Pizano of Colombia  in his address to theMeeting of the Ministerial Committee on Methodology heldearlier this year in Cartagena:“The cake of progress continues to be handed out inlarge slices for a few  and in crumbs for the rest.”Indeed it is distressing to note the dangerous tendencyof certain States to link trade and commerce with otherissues. We find unacceptable the threat or use of economicsanctions and the extraterritorial application of domestic lawto influence policies in developing countries. The use ofeconomic sanctions as a tool of policy is indefensible. It isa flagrant breach of the United Nations Charter.Narcotic drugs are a growing menace to theinternational community. Aware of the problem  Myanmaris carrying out narcotics suppression as a national cause.From the outset the Myanmar Government realized that thedrug problem can be tackled only through a multisectoralapproach and has laid down national strategies to combatthe menace. The nationwide drug-abuse controlprogramme covers many activities: crop substitution andlivestock distribution for farmers in the border areaswhere opium is grown; treatment and rehabilitation ofdrug addicts; preventive education; and law enforcement.The areas where poppies are grown are underdevelopedregions where the national races depend on the cultivationof opium as their principal means of livelihood. Hence the Government has set up an entire ministry devoted tothe development of border areas. The development ofthese areas will no doubt ensure the success of theeradication campaign.In parallel with the national effort  the Governmenthas sought closer cooperation with the United NationsInternational Drug Control Programme (UNDCP) andneighbouring countries  and is actively participating in theinternational campaign against the production andtrafficking of illicit drugs. Our efforts are meeting withsuccess  as one armed group after another has returned tothe fold to join hands with the Government indevelopment endeavours. An encouraging event this yearwas the unconditional surrender of the Mong Tai Army ofnearly 20 000 men  led by U Khun Sa. We are confidentthat this unprecedented achievement will result in adrastic reduction of the opium supply.I should like to firmly reiterate Myanmar’scommitment to the total eradication of poppy plantationsin our country. The sheer magnitude of the problemrequires new ways and means to address the problem.There must be additional efforts to curb demand  just aswe work to deter production and trafficking. We wouldwelcome increased support for our national programmesor for development projects administered by UNDCP.Environment issues are among the most widelydiscussed topics of our times. Environment anddevelopment top the international agenda as humanimpact on the environment has increased dramatically andmankind faces challenges unprecedented in scope andseverity. The tremendous growth in population  coupledwith industrial development in every region of the world has taxed the carrying capacity of the Earth. The struggleeven to support the present population at today’sstandards of living will cause environmental degradationon an unprecedented scale. However  in the last few yearsseeds of hope have been sown  as there is growingawareness in the world that the causes and consequencesof environmental degradation transcend boundaries andthat our future world must be one of partnership.17Myanmar is aware that different elements ofecological systems are linked. It is only through anintegrated approach at the national  regional and globallevels that we can achieve sustainable development. For thisreason we have been endeavouring to contribute to theprotection and promotion of the environment at every level.In developing countries like Myanmar  forests farmlands  fisheries and freshwater constitute the foundationof development. In Myanmar we are fortunate that theseresources are abundant and are not under stress. This islargely the result of the traditional culture that pervadesdaily life. Planting trees  creating gardens and parks building bridges  digging wells  and providing rest housesand monasteries are considered meritorious deeds. Thepeople of Myanmar love and respect nature and seek to livein harmony with the environment. The history of Myanmaris replete with accounts of environmental conservationcarried out by Myanmar monarchs. The ancient kings hadthe vision to protect teak forests by royal decree and toensure systematic management of forest resources.In the three years following the World Conference onHuman Rights  increasing emphasis has been placed on thepromotion and protection of human rights. While we canwelcome the spirit in which the question of human rights isconsidered  we are seriously concerned by the growingtendency of certain Western countries to politicize thequestion of human rights and to use it as a tool to interferein the domestic affairs of States. We firmly believe that theinternational community should take a more holisticapproach to the question of human rights and not bepreoccupied with individual rights and freedoms.Any government  institution or individual seeking topromote human rights should bear in mind the significanceof national and regional peculiarities as well as historical cultural and religious backgrounds and the stage ofeconomic development. In Myanmar and other developingcountries  poverty remains an effective obstacle to the fullenjoyment of those rights. For this reason we areredoubling our efforts to ensure our peoples’ right todevelopment so that they can be delivered from the clutchesof poverty.The allegations that wholesale repressive measures arebeing carried out in Myanmar have never been borne out.On the contrary  the peace and stability that now reign inthe country have allowed it to achieve significant progress.Continued economic reform will positively affect the livingstandards of all citizens. At present there is potential inMyanmar for unprecedented peace and development and forit to join the ranks of the fast-growing economies in itsregion. The international community can do no better thanto help Myanmar by playing a constructive role.In recent years a few countries  such as Myanmar have been singled out by certain countries for punitiveaction. Central to any assessment of the proper course ofpolicy towards any country is an understanding of theconditions that prevail there. In the case of Myanmar  firstand foremost  it should be noted that it is undergoingimportant reforms. Regrettably  no credit has been givento the Myanmar Government for bringing about politicalstability and economic progress in a short period of eightyears.The Government has initiated economic reformsaimed at transforming the centrally planned economy intoa market-oriented one. Private investment and domesticentrepreneurial activity have been encouraged  and theeconomy has been opened to direct foreign investment.Private-sector participation in both domestic and foreigntrade has been promoted. The economic reforms arebearing fruit and have led to sustained growth. In the pastfour years the economy recorded an average growth rateof 8.2 per cent  resulting in increased employmentopportunities and significantly rising living standards inthe country  primarily in urban areas  where privateenterprises are flourishing  and in fertile rural areas where farmers have better incentive to grow and markettheir produce.Foreign investments in Myanmar today totals $4.3billion and is expected to grow in the coming years. Thatthe pace of economic activity has quickened is reflectednot only within the country but abroad  where a growingnumber of Myanmar representatives are taking part ininternational and regional forums  including sports business and intellectual meetings.We in Myanmar are aware that the best hope for abrighter future lies in our national races joining togetherto ensure the stability of the State  community peace andtranquillity. To this end a national convention is beingheld to adopt guidelines for a new State constitution  inaccordance with which a peaceful  modern and developednation will be built.It should be appreciated that Myanmar is a unioncomposed of 135 national races from which 16 armedgroups have evolved  some dating back to 1948  the yearof our independence. It should also be noted that  despitethe magnitude of the task  the Myanmar Government has18succeeded in bringing back to the fold 15 out of the 16armed groups and has established a separate Ministry forProgress of Border Areas and National Races andDevelopment Affairs. Insurgency  which hindereddevelopment for decades  is now virtually over  and all theenergy of the defence forces and the people is beingdevoted to nation-building. One fact that is oftenoverlooked is the pervasive influence of traditional culturein Myanmar  as a result of which leniency has been shownto offenders. Although a number of death sentences werehanded down by civil and military courts following the1988 unrest in the country  none has been carried out.One factor that demonstrates our confidence in thepositive changes taking place in Myanmar is our readinessto open our doors to tourists. This year has been designated“Visit Myanmar Year”  and we are expecting hundreds ofthousands of visitors despite the negative campaignlaunched by critics. Those who call for a travel boycott toMyanmar should remember that tourism benefits a widerange of people  the visitors as well as the hosts. Big hotelsand travel agencies  as well as the family-run stalls that selleverything from hand-crafted jewellery to lacquer-ware andwood carvings  stand to make a living. Why not encouragetourists to come to Myanmar and see for themselves thevast transformations taking place?Today  as we stand on the threshold of a newmillennium  we have before us both opportunities andchallenges. At this time of important change andtransformation  the United Nations and its Member Statesmust strive to ensure that all nations can live in peace andharmony. To this end  we will need a man of exceptionalskills and wisdom at the helm of the Organization in theyears ahead. We should continue to seek the best man forthe job  bearing in mind the personal skills and integritythat the important post demands. The choice of theSecretary-General of the Organization assumes an evengreater importance at this time  when we see increasingresort to the threat or use of force in a manner inconsistentwith the purposes and principles of the Organization.In conclusion  I should like to renew Myanmar’spledge to work with all nations to strengthen theOrganization and to achieve universal peace."
"115",4771,"MNG",51,1996,"﻿At the outset  I wishto extend my sincere congratulations to His ExcellencyMr. Razali Ismail of Malaysia on his unanimous electionto the high post of the presidency of this session of theGeneral Assembly. I also wish to express my appreciationto His Excellency Mr. Freitas do Amaral for his excellentstewardship of the historic fiftieth session of the GeneralAssembly.The current session is being held at a time when thecontours of a new international system are still beingshaped. The twentieth century has witnessed thegeneration of enormous wealth. However  its distributionamong regions  individual States and groups within Statesremains uneven. Scientific and technologicaldevelopments have led to great strides in the advancementof human society while they have posed potentiallydisruptive threats to its survival. Trends towardsglobalization and integration are accompanied by theforces of fragmentation and marginalization. The winds ofsweeping democratic change have touched the greater partof the family of nations. By and large  the world todayfinds itself at a momentous juncture  at a time of bothopportunities and challenges.Today no country can afford to stay aloof from thetremendous transformations that are going on. InMongolia  this year ushered in a new era. As a result ofgeneral elections held last summer  State power has beenpeacefully transferred to democratic political forces forthe first time in 75 years. This marks the logicalculmination of the 1990 democratic revolution and lays asolid foundation for stable democratic development. It is10also a result of the simultaneous pursuit of both politicaland economic reforms.The reform process is complex  time-consuming andchallenging. Mongolia is not alone in facing the challengesinherent in laying the foundations of an open  democratic just and humane society and in creating conditions foraccelerated social and economic development. Like manyother developing countries undergoing fundamentalchanges  Mongolia is faced with a host of problems: a lowlevel of development  poverty  unemployment  an externaldebt burden and an underdeveloped national economicstructure vulnerable to fluctuations on the world market. Inspite of those hardships  the Government of Mongolia isdetermined to undertake decisive measures to speed up thereform process.The Government of Mongolia  while preserving thecontinuity of its multipillared foreign policy  is resolved topursue an active  balanced foreign policy based on nationalinterests. Mongolia will continue its strong support for themultifaceted activities of the United Nations as one of themain pillars of its foreign policy.A few days ago the international community witnesseda landmark event designed to attain the goal of a nuclear-weapon-free world. I refer to the adoption by the GeneralAssembly of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.This morning I had the privilege of signing the Treaty onbehalf of Mongolia. It is of paramount importance  in ourview  that all the declared nuclear Powers and thresholdStates accede to the Treaty so that the many years of hardwork that went into it may yield tangible results. With aview to contributing to an effective implementation of thisimportant Treaty  Mongolia will actively participate in itsinternational monitoring system.We believe that the creation of more nuclear-weapon-free zones in different regions of the world will contributeto the strengthening of regional and international peace andsecurity. Therefore  we commend and support theDeclarations of Africa and South-East Asia as nuclear-weapon-free zones. In 1992  Mongolia declared its territorya nuclear-weapon-free zone  and I am pleased to note herethat the nuclear-weapon States  along with other countries have welcomed and supported our initiative. Mongoliaintends to formalize and upgrade the status of the zone tothe international level. In a broader context  it is essentialto provide assurances to non-nuclear-weapon States againstthe use or threat of use of nuclear weapons  in the form ofan international instrument.The advisory opinion of the International Court ofJustice on the illegality of the use or threat of use ofnuclear weapons  as well as the importantrecommendations contained in the report of the CanberraCommission  could serve as a sound basis in furthernegotiations on non-proliferation and nucleardisarmament.While expressing Mongolia’s satisfaction with theChemical Weapons Convention that will soon come intoforce  I should like to stress the importance of itsratification by States with substantial arsenals of chemicalweapons so that the Convention can be more effective ineliminating this type of weapon of mass destruction.Turning to regional issues  I should like to underlinein particular our deep concern over the uncertainsituations in the Balkans and on the Korean peninsula.The recent events in the Middle East are adverselyaffecting the peace process that is under way. We believethat the parties concerned should exercise utmost restraintand resolve the problems by political negotiation  asenvisaged in the Madrid and Oslo agreements.The peaceful advancement of the human family andits safety can no longer be assured in a worldcharacterized by abject poverty  external debt burdens  agrowing technological and economic gap between the richand the poor  widespread hunger and malnutrition increasing violence and discrimination  crimes and druguse. It would probably be axiomatic to say that no onecan ensure his or her own security at the expense ofothers. However  merely acknowledging this fact canhardly help solve the problem. There must be realdetermination and political will  coupled with collectiveaction  to face the challenges ahead.The recent international conferences on children  theenvironment  human rights  population  socialdevelopment and human settlements organized under theauspices of the United Nations have forged a clear visionand a forward-looking strategy for our common andconcerted action toward the betterment of the humancondition. Mongolia holds the view that this newframework for international development cooperationshould find its due reflection in the Agenda forDevelopment  which would ensure their integrated andcomprehensive implementation and follow-up. Vital  inthis regard  is a coherent coordination of the policies andactivities of the various entities of the United Nationssystem and those of the Bretton Woods institutions at theglobal and national levels.The implementation of the decisions of theaforementioned conferences requires genuine politicalcommitment on the part of the international community andits individual members to substantially increase theresources for sustainable human development. We believethat mobilization of added financial resources can be madepossible by reducing global military spending and capturingthe resultant peace dividend for human priority needs. Ourcommon and shared future calls for the donor countries thathave not yet done so to honour their long-standingcommitment to the 0.7 per cent target.We welcome and support the World TradeOrganization as a multilateral forum for defining aninternational trade policy aimed at coordinating andpromoting the interests of countries with different levels ofdevelopment. Mongolia will join this Organization shortly which will allow it a greater involvement in world tradeand economic integration. Likewise  Mongolia will activelyendeavour to secure its proper place in the Asia-Pacificintegration  a region characterized by high economicdevelopment and overall political stability.Handicapped by their geographical location  the land-locked developing countries face particular difficulties intheir development efforts. Owing to their disadvantagedposition  they risk being further isolated and marginalizedfrom the globalization process. In this connection  I wish toemphasize the practical importance of implementing theGlobal Framework for Transit Transport CooperationBetween Land-locked and Transit-developing Countries andthe Donor Community  endorsed by the General Assemblyat its last session.South-South cooperation has become a potentialinstrument for accelerating the effective integration ofdeveloping countries into the global economy. I believe thatthe conference on finance  trade and investment to be heldin Costa Rica next January will help to further enhanceSouth-South cooperation by identifying its future priorities.With the acceleration of scientific and technologicalprogress  the question of protecting the environment frommercantile human activities is acquiring an ever-increasingimportance. Effective international cooperation aimed atoffsetting the adverse effects of industrialization oncountries  especially in environmentally sensitive regions;preserving their unique nature and ecosystems; shieldingthem from natural disasters; and mitigating the damageinflicted is the order of the day. Furthermore  this requiresan allocation of additional resources and their effectiveutilization. Elaboration of a national strategy for sustainabledevelopment  in line with the Earth Summit Declarationand Agenda 21  is well under way in my country.Mongolia attaches particular importance to the specialsession of the General Assembly scheduled for 1997 toreview the implementation of Agenda 21. In preparationfor that session  a study could be conducted on the rootcauses of the considerable increase in natural disastersover recent years  as noted in the report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization.Today  it is vital to foster respect for and compliancewith the norms of international law. In this regard Mongolia welcomes the establishment of the InternationalSeabed Authority and supports the creation of aninternational criminal court. We believe that theinternational community should elaborate the guidingprinciples of conducting international negotiations — themain instrument of bilateral and international diplomacy.Mongolia fully shares the view that the UnitedNations should be restructured  its activities modified anddemocratized  and its effectiveness and efficiencyimproved along the lines of the objectives set forth in theDeclaration on the Occasion of the Fiftieth Anniversaryof the United Nations. I hope that the ongoingdeliberations in the high-level Working Groups of theGeneral Assembly will result in the adoption of specificaction-oriented recommendations that will make theUnited Nations better equipped  financed and structuredto serve the ideals enshrined in the Charter.Security Council reform should be intensifiedthrough the introduction of greater transparency in itsactivities and the democratization of its working methods.The expansion of its composition must ensure the fair andequitable representation of various regions and groups ofStates as well as its increased effectiveness andefficiency. It goes without saying that  in the finalanalysis  this world Organization can be only as good asits Member States allow it to be.Less than four years separate us from the nextmillennium. The time has come for resolute action. Thetime has come to collectively undertake radical changes.The time has come to fulfil the dreams of our forefathersto build a better future for our children."
"116",4813,"MOZ",51,1996,"﻿On behalf of mydelegation  and on my own behalf  I wish to congratulateyou  Sir  on your unanimous election as President of theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-first session. I am convincedthat your qualities of a gifted diplomat devoted to the causeof peace and understanding among peoples will ensure asuccessful outcome of our deliberations. I pledge mydelegation’s full support as you discharge your nobleresponsibilities.I would like to seize this opportunity to commend thebrilliant manner in which your predecessor  Mr. Freitas doAmaral of Portugal  presided over the proceedings of thefiftieth session of the General Assembly.Let me also pay a well-deserved tribute to Mr. BoutrosBoutros-Ghali  Secretary-General of the United Nations  forhis continued contribution and personal commitment to theideals of international peace and security.We celebrate today the fourth anniversary of theestablishment of a peaceful Mozambique after a long periodof uncertainty in our history. It has been a period of greatchallenges and sacrifices  but also of great excitement forall Mozambicans. With peace  we are gradually healing thewounds caused by the war and our young multi-partydemocracy is flourishing and consolidating its roots. TheAssembly of the Republic  our Parliament  has beenmeeting regularly  symbolizing our collective desire to worktogether for the consolidation of peace  nationalreconstruction and democracy. Similarly  efforts are beingmade to implement the Government’s five-year programme in which the reduction of absolute poverty  with emphasison education  health  rural development and job creation continues to be our major objective.At the same time  preparations are being made witha view to beginning next year the holding of municipalelections  thus complementing the process initiated in1994 with the holding of the first multi-party general andpresidential elections. In view of financial and otherconstraints  the Government anticipates that municipalelections will take place on a gradual basis. However  thefinal decision will be made by the Assembly of theRepublic itself  following the completion of the ongoingdebate on the subject.What is important in our view is that elections takeplace  for they represent an opportunity for the people tochoose their local representatives  identify and solve localproblems and define their own needs and priorities. TheGovernment is also addressing  as a matter of urgency the establishment and strengthening of all the differenttribunals envisaged in the Constitution  with a view toenabling the normal functioning of the judiciary system asan important step forward in the efforts to strengthen therule of law  democracy and respect for individual rightsand freedoms.Furthermore  we continue to be fully committed toensuring public safety and security. To this end  myGovernment has recently submitted to donor countries aproject proposal in order to begin the process ofupgrading the technical capacity of the police  thusenabling that institution to deal more effectively withcrime prevention  control and other challenges. Theseinclude continuing the search for and destruction of armsthroughout the country and dealing with transnationalcrimes  particularly drug trafficking and moneylaundering.Furthermore  demining continues to be one of myGovernment’s top priorities. For us  demining is not anend per se. Rather  it is a process which we regard as anintegral part of the overall national development process.Where possible  it has been our policy to stimulate thelaunching of agricultural production and related activitiesonce demining is completed. However  given themagnitude of the land-mine issue in Mozambique resulting from many years of conflict  additional resourcesare needed effectively to address this problem in the yearsahead  in particular within the framework of strengtheningthe national capacity for demining.From this rostrum  I would like to express mygratitude to all those countries and organizations whichhave contributed to the demining programme inMozambique. We look forward to continuing work9together with a view to eliminating these horrible weaponsnot only in Mozambique  but also in all countries affectedby this evil. Accordingly  and in line with my last year’sstatement before this Assembly  my Government reiteratesits full support to the call for an international agreementagainst the production  stockpiling and use of anti-personalland-mines.Recently  my Government and the Office of theUnited Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR)concluded the repatriation and resettlement of Mozambicancitizens who had sought refuge in neighbouring countriesduring the armed conflict. This programme  initiated as aresult of a memorandum of understanding signed in March1993 with UNHCR and subsequent agreements  has beenregarded as one of the biggest and most successfulrepatriation programmes ever undertaken by UNHCR.Thanks to this programme  around 1.7 millionMozambicans have safely and voluntarily returned to theirplaces of origin. We are now proud to say that there are nomore Mozambicans living abroad as refugees.However  the challenges before us are immense. Weare aware of the difficulties facing this segment of ourpopulation and the long road still ahead before we candeclare them economically safe and ready to live on theirown. This is where the assistance of the internationalcommunity is most needed and appreciated.With the end of the repatriation process and theresettlement of these populations  there has been significantprogress in agricultural production. As a matter of fact recorded agricultural output in certain areas of Mozambiquethis year is the highest since independence. The mainproblem we face now is that of the financial capacity tobuy and store adequately the surplus of this production. Weneed support to build warehouses within the framework ofthe food security programme.Like many other developing countries  Mozambiquehas been undergoing a structural adjustment programmesince 1987. The core objectives of the programme were inter alia  to create and adjust the country’s macroeconomicpolicy  ensure a correct legal and regulatory framework forthe development of a strong market economy  provide atransparent and accountable policy framework aimed atpromoting investment  allocate adequate budgetaryresources for social programmes  create the necessaryconditions for the establishment and consolidation ofdemocratic institutions and support good governance andpolitical stability.After almost 10 years of implementation of thisprogramme under the most adverse conditions  someprogress has been achieved. Nevertheless  the overallobjectives  including specifically the upgrading of theliving standards of the population  are still far from beingachieved. In some cases living standards of workingpeople have  in fact  deteriorated in recent years  whichmay erode the political support needed for thecontinuation of the reforms.As of next year  Mozambique will have to startmeeting its debt-servicing obligations to multilateralinstitutions  as this category of debt has not been eligiblefor rescheduling so far. The debt burden  coupled withvery restrictive monetary policies and related measurespursued in connection with the structural adjustmentprogramme  will certainly have a serious negative impacton the performance of the national economy. Unlessmeasures are taken to address this situation  it will bevery difficult for the country to sustain the envisagedpolitical  economic and social targets required to uplift theliving standards of the people. The situation of mycountry’s indebtedness is a critical one  indeed  as it hasincreased by about six per cent during the last two years.In 1994  debt servicing alone absorbed about 93 per centof the country’s total export earnings and representedabout 28.6 per cent of gross domestic product. Thisscenario is likely to remain  under the prevailingcircumstances  for the next few years. Therefore  myGovernment supports the view that a comprehensiveeffort should be made to effectively address the externalindebtedness of developing countries  in particular theleast developed countries undertaking painful structuraladjustment programmes and whose growth prospectscontinue to be severely undermined by this burden.In order to address official bilateral debt problems the Naples Terms  adopted by the Paris Club  in favour ofthe poorest and most indebted countries should beexpeditiously implemented. At the same time  we believenon-Paris Club creditors which have not done so shouldalso consider taking appropriate relief measures toalleviate the suffering of debtor nations. Measuresannounced at the recently held Lyon Summit could nothave been more timely. We look forward to welcomingtheir early implementation.As I speak on this subject  I would like to launch anemphatic appeal for a closer partnership between debtors10and creditors. We have recently been pleased to note that at the political level  there appears to be a growingunderstanding of developing countries’ concerns over theissue of the external debt crisis. We would therefore bedeeply appreciative if this understanding were translatedinto tangible results and if the subsequent technicaldiscussions held following political consultations weremuch more fruitful. Regrettably  this has not always beenthe case. A comprehensive approach to assist leastdeveloped countries through a flexible implementation ofexisting instruments and through finding new mechanisms is necessary. These include improvements in capital andinvestment flows and an increase in real terms of theofficial development assistance to least developed countries particularly in Africa.To this end  we call upon donor countries international financial institutions and United Nationsorgans and specialized agencies to effectively participate inthe implementation of the Programme of Action for theleast developed countries for the 1990s  the mid-termreview of which was held in September last year.Similarly  my delegation welcomes the recentlylaunched United Nations System-wide Special Initiative onAfrica  for it brings a new impetus to the internationalcommunity’s awareness of the necessity to bring about ameaningful solution to African problems. Additional effortsshould be made to prevent repetition of past experiencesduring the implementation of similar important initiatives by ensuring a successful implementation of this one. Therecent mid-term review of the United Nations New Agendafor the Development of Africa has highlighted the positivechanges made in the right direction during the last fewyears on the African continent. These trends should besupported and encouraged by the international community.In this regard  my Government hopes that the reportbeing prepared by a group of experts led by Ms. GraçaMachel  in conformity with the General Assemblyresolution 48/157 of 20 December 1993  will contributesignificantly to drawing the international community’sattention on the fate of children victimized by armedconflicts in the world  particularly  in Africa.The current session of the General Assembly offers aunique opportunity for a collective review of the issue ofconflict resolution in many parts of the world. With respectto Angola  the recent summit of the Southern AfricanDevelopment Community (SADC) organ on politics defence and security has expressed concern over the slowprogress and apparent stalemate in the implementation ofthe Lusaka Protocol. The summit expressed  inter alia deep regret over the absence of the União Nacional paraa Independência Total de Angola (UNITA) from themeeting and made a strong appeal to UNITA to fulfil itscommitment within the deadline established by theLusaka Protocol and those of Security Council resolution864 (1993).Mozambique  along with other SADC countries  ismaking its contribution to the smooth progress of thisdelicate process. The settlement of the conflict in Angolawill contribute decisively to the materialization ofstrategic goals set forth by SADC and allow our region toembark on the process of regional integration and todedicate our efforts to the well-being of our peoples.Within the recently created Lusophone Community or Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries  we arealso working hard to encourage the peace process inAngola. In doing so  we aim to consolidate the historicand cultural ties which unite the seven countries that havePortuguese as their official language  thus creating thenecessary conditions for a more fruitful cooperationamong them.We are encouraged by the recent progress in SierraLeone and Rwanda and look forward to a positiveoutcome of the crises in those countries. However  weremain concerned at the prevailing volatile situations inBurundi  Liberia and Somalia. We welcome all initiativesaimed at finding the needed political settlement of thecrises in these African countries.The recurrence of such long-lasting conflicts remainsa serious challenge to the international community as awhole and also to the efforts within the framework of therecently established Organization of African Unity (OAU)Mechanism for Conflict Prevention  Management andResolution. My delegation wishes to commend all thecountries that have lent their support to the functioning ofthe Mechanism  thus enabling Africans to take a muchmore active role in searching for solutions to the conflictson their continent.The recent outbreak of violence in the Middle Eastis a matter of grave concern to my delegation. Thisviolence  if not averted urgently  will be a serious setbackto the commendable progress made in the quest for apolitical settlement to the long-standing conflict in thatregion. We call upon all the parties concerned to exercisemaximum restraint and to display the needed politicalmaturity in the implementation of the mutually agreedcommitments in the interest of all the peoples of the region.In this connection  we are encouraged by the dialogueinitiated in the recent summit in Washington between thePrime Minister of Israel and the President of the PalestinianAuthority with a view to putting an end to violence andresuming the peace process.We have also followed the developments regarding theissue of East Timor. In making an assessment of theprogress made so far  one cannot fail to registerdisappointment over the slow pace of talks betweenIndonesia and Portugal. Nevertheless  my delegation wishesto encourage both countries to assume their responsibilitieswith more vigour  with a view to finding a just comprehensive and internationally acceptable solution tothis issue  bearing in mind the need to allow the people ofEast Timor an opportunity to exercise their political rights including the right to self-determination.Time and again  virtually all Member States haveemphasized the critical need to undertake reforms withinthe United Nations so as to ensure greater effectiveness inits work and to fulfil the sacrosanct principles enshrined inits Charter. The needed reforms within our Organizationshould not be regarded as an end in themselves. Theyshould  inter alia  pave the way for the active and globalparticipation of the developing countries  particularly theleast developed countries  in the work and procedures of theUnited Nations  including the Economic and Social Council bearing in mind the shared responsibilities of thesecountries in the economic and social challenges facingtoday’s world.In this reform process  the strengthening of the UnitedNations system  which does not necessarily meandownsizing  is of paramount importance. The revitalizationof the role of the Economic and Social Council is longoverdue to allow better coordination and effective andefficient management of the funds  programmes andspecialized agencies of the United Nations system. Reformsshould also reflect the dynamics of international relationsand the growing need for enhanced democracy  equitablegeographic representation and the changes in thecomposition of its membership since the establishment ofthe United Nations 51 years ago. Above all  they shouldensure the needed legitimacy  transparency and efficiencyof its decisions.In this connection  my delegation shares thefrustrations expressed by a number of delegations regardingthe lack of tangible progress within the Open-endedWorking Group on the Question of EquitableRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of theSecurity Council and other matters related to the SecurityCouncil. Since the beginning of its procedures  importantand interesting ideas have been advanced in this regard.Therefore  nobody can deny the arguments calling for anexpansion of that body. Lack of progress on theenlargement of the Security Council will only underminethe ability of the United Nations to discharge fully itsobligations and limit the confidence of internationalpublic opinion on the future of our Organization. It isonly by addressing the issue of enlargement and by eachone’s fulfilling its financial obligations that we canreaffirm our commitment to the purposes and principlesof the Charter and expect a well-functioning and dynamicUnited Nations ready to face the challenges of the nextcentury. What is necessary is a genuine political will tochange the status quo  which has favoured a limitednumber of Member States to the detriment of thelegitimate interests of the vast majority of its membership.In its 51 years of existence the United Nations despite numerous difficulties during this period  has beenable to achieve its crucial objective of halting theemergence of a third world war. Therefore  it must beallowed to continue to preserve the gains already achievedand draw lessons from mistakes of the past so as toensure the feasibility of its mandate  as we approach thetwenty-first century  in the maintenance of internationalpeace and security  in monitoring the implementation ofimportant decisions taken in the economic  social andenvironmental fields and in playing a more dynamic rolein the quest for the development of our countries."
"117",4858,"MRT",51,1996,"﻿I should like to convey to the President  on behalfof my delegation  my warm congratulations on his electionto the presidency of the fifty-first session of the GeneralAssembly. We are convinced that his personal qualities experience and great skill are our best guarantee for thesuccess of this session and will enable us to achievepositive results.I should also like to take this opportunity to expressour gratitude and esteem to Mr. Freitas do Amaral President of the fiftieth session  who so ably guided thework of the Assembly last year.I should also like once again to extend our entireconfidence to our brother  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  andto express to him our thanks for the great efforts he hastirelessly expended since shouldering his heavyresponsibilities in strengthening the universality andcredibility of the United Nations and enhancing itscapacity to play its rightful role  notwithstandingparticularly difficult international circumstances.It is gratifying to note that  as the Organizationenters into its second 50 years of life  substantial progressis being made on the road to peace throughout the world.Thus  East-West confrontation  more commonlyknown as the cold war  has ended and the spectre of thebalance of terror has disappeared  giving way to dialogueand cooperation in the establishment and maintenance ofworld peace and security. Other important steps have alsobeen taken towards decolonization  the eradication ofracial discrimination and the full exercise by peoples oftheir right to self-determination.We must  however  note that these achievements valuable as they are  have not contributed significantly toimproving the situation in many parts of the world where in some countries  there are still hotbeds of tension andbloody wars. Nor have they sufficed to eliminate thepoverty and underdevelopment that are still the daily lotof a large proportion of the inhabitants of our planet.Thus  developing countries continue to suffer thecombined effects of the world economic crisis and theongoing deterioration of terms of trade and to bear theburden of an external debt that exhausts their resources atthe very time that official development assistance isconstantly decreasing.The past year has seen no important improvement inthe world economic situation. That conclusion isunavoidable  since the current economic crisis has as itsbasis the inequity inherent in the world economy  aninequity whose major consequences are macroeconomicimbalance  unfair terms of trade and inequality in thedistribution of wealth.In this framework  the African continent is obviouslythe hardest hit by the negative effects of the deteriorationin economic conditions owing to the burden of itsexternal debt and the fall in the prices of the raw12materials that make up the principal source of income formost African countries.The Sahel region is among those on our continent thatis suffering the most from this situation  especially giventhe chronic drought from which it has suffered for overthree decades and that has weakened and sometimesdestroyed the economies of its component countries.However  we are gratified by the increased interestshown in recent years with regard to African developmentand we welcome the System-wide Special Initiative forAfrica launched by the Secretary-General  which we wouldlike to see implemented as soon as possible.The consolidation of democracy and the constructionof a State based on the rule of law and respect for humanrights are positive results of the activities of theinternational community  as reflected in the resolutions ofthe United Nations and its specialized agencies as well asin the decisions and recommendations handed down byseveral conferences organized under United Nationsauspices or with its support. This confirms the importanceof the collective effort of the United Nations and shouldencourage the Organization to continue its pursuit of thenoble objectives of mankind.In that connection  and in order to enable the UnitedNations to strengthen such action  it is particularly urgentand essential to work on the restructuring of its organs  therationalization of its working methods and the improvementin its performance.To that end  my country supports the proposalsdesigned to give renewed dynamism to the Economic andSocial Council  to end duplication in its subsidiary bodiesand to improve its rules of operation. We also supportproposals aimed at enlarging representation in the SecurityCouncil in keeping with the requirements of democracy transparency and equity.We also believe that the principle of equality amongMember States should be the basis for any actionundertaken to restructure the Security Council  which according to Article 24 of the United Nations Charter  actson behalf of all Member States. This means that theCouncil has an obligation to reflect the universal characterof the United Nations.Allow me to say a word about the democratic processin Mauritania  the first phase of which began 10 years agoin 1986 with the first local elections and was followed bythe adoption of the 1991 Constitution. Pluralistic  multi-party presidential and parliamentary elections followed in1992 and the second round of local elections in 1994.This process is being strengthened once again by theholding on 11 October of the second round of legislativeelections in a free and transparent climate. Two hundredand sixty-nine candidates  most from 13 political parties will appeal to the voters for the 79 seats of the NationalAssembly. All provisions have been made to ensure thatthis election takes place under the best conditions.With this new achievement  the Mauritanian peoplewill confirm that it has become  as stated by HisExcellency President Maaouya Ould Sid’Ahmed Taya “the source of sovereignty and legality” and the master ofits own destiny and affairs.Having won the struggle for democracy andachieved the institution of the rule of law and theguarantee of all individual and collective rights Mauritania is engaged in another  equally determinedstruggle against economic and social underdevelopment.In this regard  many economic reform programmes havebeen implemented since 1985 within the framework of aliberal policy incorporating all development dimensionsand designed to raise the living standards of citizens andmaking basic services available to them.These reforms have allowed us to reinvigorate publicfinances  overcome inflation and restore continuedgrowth. Many projects have also been carried out in theareas of communications  transportation infrastructure village electrification  expanded water-supply networksand increased health-care coverage. Let me express ourappreciation to all of the brotherly and friendly countries institutions and non-governmental organizations that havesupported my country’s efforts towards these goals andthank them for the aid they have provided and continueto provide.Strengthening democracy and economic and socialdevelopment requires the consolidation of peace andsecurity both for States and individuals. We musttherefore note the striking paradox  despite the end of thecold war and new hopes for peace and justice  of there-emergence of terrorism  instability and the proliferationof hotbeds of tension around the world.The Middle East is one region where  unfortunately this paradox is most alarming. My country  renewing itsfull support for the peace process  remains convinced thatSecurity Council resolutions 242 (1967)  338 (1973) and13425 (1978) and the principle of “land for peace”  adoptedat the Madrid Conference  remain the bases for anycomprehensive  just and lasting peace in that region.We also believe that there can be no real solution tothe Middle East problem as long as Israel has notwithdrawn from all the occupied Palestinian territories including the Holy Arab City of Al-Quds  the Golan andsouthern Lebanon.We had therefore welcomed the new era that seemedto have emerged with the signing on 13 September 1993 ofthe Declaration of Principles on the autonomy of Gaza andJericho and other positive advances that followed especially the 1994 Cairo agreement  the peace Agreementbetween Israel and Jordan  and the Taba Agreement on theimplementation of the second phase of the Declaration ofPrinciples  signed in Washington on 28 September 1995.We had hoped that the Palestinian people will soon see theend of its tragedy by recovering its legitimate right to self-determination and to establish its independent State on itsterritory.On this basis  and in order to ensure the continuationof the peace process  the concluded Agreements must beimplemented and commitments undertaken must behonoured. Negotiations must resume among all theconcerned parties on the basis of the principles arrived atand accepted by all and in accordance with the relevantSecurity Council resolutions. My country also insists on theneed to lift the embargo imposed on the brotherlyPalestinian people  the devastating consequences of whichon the fledgling Palestinian economy and the repercussionsof which on security in the Palestinian territories couldendanger the peace process.Finally  we invite the two sponsors of the peaceprocess to assume fully their responsibilities in order toallow the people of the region to recover their legitimaterights and to open a new chapter in the history of thissubregion  so that its potential can be put to the service ofeconomic development and social advancement.Nearby  the aftermath of the Gulf War continues toraise obstacles to the normalization of the situation in thatregion. In this regard  my country has always affirmed andwishes to reaffirm today its dedication to respect forinternational legality and the United Nations resolutionspertaining to the Gulf War and its consequences. Wereiterate our rejection of any threat to the independence ofKuwait and its territorial integrity and we call for thesettlement of the question of Kuwaiti prisoners.We also reaffirm our consistent position of rejectingany action threatening the unity of fraternal Iraq and theintegrity of its territory. We call for the lifting of theembargo imposed on the Iraqi people  which is subjectingthem to famine and disease. In this regard  my countrywishes to see implemented  as soon as possible  SecurityCouncil resolution 986 (1995) on the issue of oil for food.We also wish to express our rejection of the plan beingentertained by some of Iraq’s neighbours to create a safearea in northern Iraq  in contradiction to their declareddedication to territorial integrity and unity and in violationof the principles and rules of international law and theUnited Nations Charter.My country believes that the United Arab Emirateshas the inalienable right to recover its full and completesovereignty over the islands of Abu Musa  Greater Tunband Lesser Tunb. We reiterate our support for the UnitedArab Emirates in its endeavours to recover its rights byall available means.In the Arab Maghreb  the question of WesternSahara is a consistent source of great concern because ofits threat to stability and security in the subregion. Mycountry also believes that the United Nations  and theSecurity Council in particular  should  now more thanever  assume its full responsibility for the implementationof the settlement plan  in keeping with resolutions adoptedto that end on the holding of a free and impartialreferendum that will make it possible to achieve acomprehensive and definitive solution to the question ofWestern Sahara and to ensure security and stability in theregion. For our part  we continue to be prepared tocontribute positively to the achievement of that aim.With regard to the embargo that for several yearshas affected the Libyan people  my country wishes to seegreater receptivity to Libya’s obvious willingness tocooperate with the United Nations and other concernedparties  in seeking a solution to the crisis between it andcertain western countries. We call for the lifting of thisembargo — which is hurting the Libyan people and allthe peoples of the Maghreb — and hope that the proposalof the League of Arab States  which enjoys broad support will open up new opportunities to put an end to it.With regard to security and stability  Africacontinues to face major problems. Conflicts are spreadingdeath  famine and epidemic throughout the continent. InSomalia  the war continues to leave a train of death anddestruction and the international community  despite thesolidarity it has shown in the past through its14involvement  no longer evinces much interest in a situationthat is threatening the Somali people. We hope the Somalipeople will overcome their differences and find a way toconduct a constructive dialogue.In Liberia  we hope that the peace process willcontinue  in keeping with the Abuja Agreement  and wereiterate our support for the decisions taken by theministerial ad hoc Committee of the Economic Communityof West African States (ECOWAS) at its seventh sessionand the decisions and recommendations of the last twosummits of the Organization of African Unity andECOWAS on Liberia  so that peace and harmony mayreturn to that fraternal country.We hope that our Rwandan and Burundian brotherswill  in their countries  resolve their conflicts and seekdialogue and understanding in solving their problems. Wealso hope that they will be able to face the challenges ofdevelopment and devote to it the energies now beingdevoted to their differences.With regard to Bosnia and Herzegovina  my countryexpresses satisfaction at the important advances made alongthe road to peace  especially the recent democraticelections. We reaffirm also the need to continueimplementation of the Dayton Agreement and to see theinternational community exert the necessary effort for thereconstruction of that country  whose infrastructure hasbeen destroyed and whose people have suffered the mosthorrifying forms of aggression.The United Nations must adapt to the world as it isand to the changes it undergoes. The Islamic Republic ofMauritania wishes to reiterate its willingness andcommitment to work in concert with other Member Statestowards the realization of the noble goals of ourOrganization  in particular the consolidation of peace andsecurity in the world.At a time when most third-world countries are facingenormous challenges that hamper their advance towardsgreater progress and prosperity  and while our planet isfacing environmental challenges that threaten the future ofall life on Earth  considerable resources are being devotedto the production  refinement and acquisition of weapons ofmass destruction of all kinds  while official developmentassistance continues to decline.In this respect we hope that the recent Treatyprohibiting nuclear tests will be one important step alongthe way to complete and general disarmament  the only wayto free up the necessary resources for the development ofthe third world.Today  more than half a century after the creation ofour Organization  we must be fully aware of our commondestiny. We must dedicate ourselves to promotingmutually advantageous international cooperation andbringing about effective solidarity equal to the challengeswe face to ensure a better future for all humankind.My country  as in the past  will continue to worktowards the strengthening of friendly and brotherlyrelations among all peoples and nations in the pursuit ofthe noble ideals aspired to by the founding fathers of theUnited Nations."
"118",4904,"MUS",51,1996,"﻿I join all those whohave gone before me in congratulating you  Sir  on behalfof Mauritius  on your accession to the office of President ofthe General Assembly at its fifty-first session. I also thankMr. Freitas do Amaral of Portugal for his skilfulstewardship of the fiftieth session.Hearing and reading the speeches of world leaders tothis Assembly  I am struck by the extraordinary degree ofunanimity between them — how much we seem to agree inprinciple but how little on the right course of action; on thenecessity of diplomacy and discussion as the primary pathto peace; on the necessity of according to every man woman and child the fundamental rights and freedomswhich this Organization has  over the years  done so muchto establish; on the necessity of providing equalopportunities for men  women and children in all oursocieties; on the necessity of protecting the environment;and on the need to ensure that mankind moves forwardtogether on the path of development.In all these noble and commendable aims we areunited. However  we often seem to suffer from a paralysiswhen it comes to actual implementation of these goodintentions.This Organization was the response of the human raceto the catastrophic experiences of two world wars and toscientific discoveries and inventions which confronted uswith unprecedented choices. It was an expression of faithin the power of human beings to be rational in the face ofthese choices and to choose the paths of peace and progressinstead of war and destruction.But sometimes its voice has seemed very faint andfar off in the midst of the terrible troubles that haveafflicted us since then. Some have begun to mutter of theineffectiveness of the institution and to complain of thecost. I am convinced that those criticisms do not begin toexpress the whole truth about the work that is done bythis Organization. We are embarked upon a great andnecessary experiment  and that is why the work of theSecretary-General is so important. Here I should like topay tribute to Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  whosecontribution has been so valuable in recent years. It isparticularly appropriate that this great office should befilled  as we move into the next millennium  by arepresentative of Africa  for Africa remains the greatintransigent challenge which the world has scarcely yetbegun to face. Only through the renewed and concerteddetermination of this Organization and the vision ofcooperation and mutual responsibility which it representsis there any hope of successfully meeting theextraordinary difficulties which the next century willbring.Decade after decade  many of the nations of Africahave seen their efforts at development frustrated bynatural and man-made disasters  poor governance and ahostile international environment. Foreign aid has not hadthe desired impact on the progress of these countries  andthe poorer nations have accumulated huge andunmanageable debt which they labour  with inadequatetools  to support.As the Assembly knows  of the 36 poorest countriesin the world  as classified by the United NationsDevelopment Programme in the human developmentindex  29 are in Africa. The majority of them have percapita incomes lower than they were 20 years ago. Thecountries of sub-Saharan Africa last year attracted only 3per cent of the foreign direct investment into thedeveloping world  compared to 20 per cent for LatinAmerica and the Caribbean and 59 per cent for East Asiaand the Pacific region. Life expectancy is placed at 50.9years  the lowest among developing countries.At the same time  a new and more demandinginternational economic order is emerging  one in whichAfrica is beginning to feel overwhelmed and isolatedfrom the mainstream of world economic development. Ifsome of its nations have not yet caught up with theindustrial revolution  what hope have they  unaided  ofreaching the heights of the technological and informationrevolutions which are sweeping the developed countriesof the world towards new horizons.If we are to bring Africa into the general march of theeconomies of the world towards progress and prosperity  wemust begin  at the highest level  to coordinate and to charta course for Africa to join in. Piecemeal aid and occasionalintervention on the occasion of awesome disasters will notbe enough.Therefore  we welcome the Group of Seven’scommitment in Lyon to a partnership for development andto the elimination of trade barriers to exports fromdeveloping countries. These barriers must come down. Butwe question whether this and private investment alone willbe sufficient. Swift and dramatic debt relief for countries inneed of it is essential. We welcome the lead provided bythe World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF)in this regard  but it must be followed by decisive andurgent action. Measures should also be designed to promotethe growth of real democracy and good governance  foreconomic prosperity must go hand in hand with democracyand the rule of law. It may seem temporarily otherwise. Itmay seem that the creation of wealth can  for a while  beseparated from the yearning of the people and ofindividuals to be free  but sooner or later the force of theaspirations which prosperity brings will burst forth  as thewaters burst from the dam.Surely we must look with dismay at many areas of ourworld in which human rights are discounted or denied. Acase in point is Myanmar  where a democratic vote  held in1990  has been defeated and denied by force  and where thehouse of the elected leader of the people is kept underconstant surveillance and surrounded by soldiers.My Government will continue to support the cause ofdemocracy and human rights in Africa and wherever in theworld such support is required. Mauritius will later thismonth host the twentieth session of the AfricanCommission of Human and People’s Rights  whichcommemorates the tenth anniversary of its African Charter.This session of the Commission will undertake  with theparticipation of non-governmental organizations and otherinterested elements of civil society  an assessment andreevaluation of the implementation of the Charter andprepare a five-year plan of action which we are confidentwill greatly help strengthen and improve the situation ofhuman rights in our continent.My country  whose only resources are the stability ofits democracy and the enterprising spirit of its people comprises many races  cultures and religions. We look toEurope  Africa  the Far East and the Indian subcontinent forour cultural inheritance. Our people cross many divides.Therefore  we are able to witness and sense the impact ofthe rapid development of the modern world upon thesedifferent cultures and peoples more quickly  because weare a part of them. And I can tell the Assembly that whatwe see gives us cause for concern.As the old world order passes and a new onereplaces it  we are going through a period of transitionfraught with pitfalls and dangers. We cannot but bedismayed at the number of countries that are falling preyto the ancient and deadly sirens of ethnicity and narrownationalism that appeal to man’s baser instincts ofintolerance and xenophobic fear. Our continent of Africaseems particularly affected. Somalia and Liberia seem todescend endlessly into chaos  while Burundi threatens toblow up again.We are concerned by recent indications that partiesto the Middle East peace process may be giving in to thetemptation of pandering to extremist fringes. We owepeace to this Holy Land and to the generations to come.We owe it to the memory of two statesmen who laiddown their lives to this cause. The resolute pursuit ofpeace is the only way to defeat the assassins  those whofelled President Sadat and Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.In the Commonwealth family of nations to which webelong  the uniqueness of which is its very diversity  anumber of Member States are blighted by this affliction.Mauritius fervently hopes that the sister island of Fijiwill soon be able to resume its rightful place in thecomity of nations by correcting the inequities written intothat nation’s constitution in a moment of tension  whenracist passions were unbridled. We would be pleased toshare with the people of Fiji our own constitutionalexperience of a pluricultural society.In my own country  only 10 months ago in a freeand democratic election  the people voted overwhelminglyfor change. The Government has pledged to render ourdemocratic process even more transparent andunequivocal. The numerous strategies and policyobjectives enunciated by the new Government at thebeginning of the current legislature  earlier this year  aimprecisely at confronting squarely the problems that weface on all the issues that I have broached. Our overridingobjective will be to ultimately make the economy workfor the people and not the people work for the economy.While a Government’s overall objective is toimprove the well-being of the people  sound economic12policies alone will not make our countries prosper. In orderto create the right environment for the economy to flourishthere must be good governance. This is also a moralimperative. The history of mankind inevitably moves in thedirection of greater freedom  more transparency  wideraccountability in all sectors of public life and greater accessto information held by public agencies relating to citizens.My Government is committed to a continuing processof democratization which will reinforce our institutions bycreating wider confidence in them. We are convinced thatthis will create a climate more conducive to investment andwill enhance the creative and entrepreneurial spirit of ourpeople.While the pursuit of happiness has perforce to beindividual and private  it cannot be to the detriment of thecollective good. The protection of the environment is oneendeavour that has to be undertaken collectively at thenational as well as the global level. Only if mankind as awhole takes care to ensure the integrity of our planet canwe envisage a future for generations yet to be born. It is upto us to ensure the viability and ecological health of theplanet we shall bequeath to those who come after us. MyGovernment will pursue on its own national territory avigorous policy of conservation and rehabilitation of naturalresources. Our actions at the national level will be matchedby our contributions at the international and regional levels in concert with all our partners  to advance on these sameissues.Through our membership in regional and subregionalorganizations  we are undertaking  in close partnership withneighbouring countries  to advance and promote the sameobjectives that I have defined. Only one year after joiningthe Southern African Development Community (SADC) Mauritius has become an active member  putting its skillsand knowledge in sectors where it has acquired valuableexperience at the service of fellow members.Mauritius informed this Assembly last year that it hadinitiated a process for the creation of a regional cooperationplatform in the Indian Ocean region. Indeed  the IndianOcean region was the only one in the world which did nothave such a platform to discuss the economic and socialdevelopment policies of its countries in a coordinatedmanner. I am pleased to inform the Assembly this year thatthe Mauritius Indian Ocean Rim Initiative has gatheredconsiderable momentum. The Initiative  which started withonly seven countries  has doubled its membership to 14countries. A charter has been drawn up to provide therelevant framework within which to develop and implementregional cooperation programmes. In addition  in contrastwith some existing regional blocs  it has adopted anoutward-looking approach  so as to be compatible withthe multilateral system. The association has thedistinguishing feature of having adopted a tripartiteapproach comprising government  the private sector andthe academic community  to ensure as wide a consensusas possible.Mauritius is convening a ministerial meeting in thefirst week of March 1997 to give political blessing to theIndian Ocean rim association for regional cooperation.The Indian Ocean region can now serenely look forwardto playing its role  as a serious regional partner in theinternational arena  in the effort to uplift the standard ofliving of the peoples of the region. I am sure that theinternational community will lend its full support to thisnascent regional grouping  in line with the often repeatedappeal for South-South cooperation.We have witnessed in recent years the growingsignificance of regional accords and blocs in determiningand fashioning the orientation of multilateral financial andtrading systems and institutions. We believe thatregionalization is a necessary step towards a more liberalglobal environment inasmuch as it allows the lessendowed countries and regions with specificities of theirown to experiment and to test the political  economic andsocial reforms of their programmes. A similar approachhas been adopted by the more advanced countries andregions  as evidenced by the emergence of the NorthAmerican Free Trade Agreement and the consolidation ofexisting groupings  such as the European Union and theAssociation of South-East Asian Nations  to mention justa couple of them.In addition  we have witnessed a new interpretationof the concept of regional blocs as purely geographicalunits that make use of their own individual characteristicsto experiment  and to test political  economic and socialreforms programmes within a smaller geographical entitybefore challenges are confronted on a worldwide scale.Regionalization is increasingly being viewed by aiddonors and international financial institutions as a meansto promote overall economic development and to createan enabling environment that will attract foreign directinvestment in specific regions. This process has alsochanged the way in which international businesses andmultinational corporations are restructuring their activities.Improvements in telecommunications facilities  theadoption of advanced technology for the transmission of13information in real time and the use of more rapid andreliable modes of transportation have all contributed togiving regionalization a new dimension in political andeconomic issues. Hence  the prospects for ensuring a morebalanced global development process are more real andattainable.The decades-old partnership between African Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) States and the EuropeanUnion through the Lomé Conventions  the fourth of whichwill come to an end in the year 2000  has served as anexcellent instrument for trading agreements between theAfrican  Asian  Pacific and Caribbean countries and theEuropean Union. This instrument has to a very large extenthelped in consolidating the links between the ACP Statesand the European Union. It has permitted the growth oftrade  economic  political  social and cultural development for both developed and underdeveloped countries. However the successor agreement to Lomé IV will have to take intoaccount the changing pattern in world trade and theacquired benefits under the Lomé Conventions  and in thiscontext we shall wait for the publication of the green bookon the subject commissioned by the European Union.The Sugar Protocol  which provides for guaranteedprices and quotas for the ACP sugar-producing countries has been instrumental to a large extent in the socio-economic development of Mauritius.While I have addressed development issues mainly  weshould not overlook the crucial question of disarmament.The principled stand of Mauritius in the field ofdisarmament has always been to advocate a world free ofnuclear weapons as well as chemical and other weapons ofmass destruction. On the question of nuclear weapons  weonce again reaffirm our total commitment to nucleardisarmament  and hope that the world community will makeall efforts to secure unanimity around the views expressedin this Assembly by Member States that have somedifficulties with some treaty provisions. Furthermore  withregard particularly to the position of Mauritius on the recentdecision on the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty we stood by the principle that we have always applied toother issues in the past  namely that of fairness and non-discrimination against any party. It is therefore imperativethat we give renewed momentum to the disarmamentprocess in general  and address the flaws of theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty urgently.In order to meet the challenges of the next century  webelieve that it is urgently necessary to pursue the reform ofthe United Nations. It is vital that the Security Councilshould be enlarged and made more representative andbalanced among its permanent members  and shouldinclude developing countries such as India. And it isequally imperative that the Working Groups of theGeneral Assembly should complete their task ofproducing an effective and credible programme forreform. It seems to us self-evident that  after 50 years some revision and redesign is necessary. We think  withShakespeare “When we mean to build We first survey the plot  then draw the model;And when we see the figure of the house Then we must rate the cost of the erection;Which if we find outweighs ability What do we then but draw anew the modelIn fewer offices...?” (King Henry IV  Part 2  Act I Scene 3)Some have come to this Assembly in order tocomplain that the world and the United Nations are notdoing enough. But we should inquire of ourselves first:What are we doing to advance or to hinder these causesupon which  in principle  there is such remarkableagreement?After this overview of the world situation  allow meto speak of a matter of national interest to us. One of thefundamental principles to which we all subscribe is thatof respect for the sovereignty of Member States.Interference in the internal affairs of States and disregardfor their national sovereignty has often been a source oftension and conflict. Now that the cold war is behind usand we move towards ever greater economic  commercialand cultural integration  we should be able to findamicable answers to questions of sovereignty. Mauritiushas sovereignty disputes regarding the ChagosArchipelago and Tromelin Island with two countries withwhich we have historically close and friendly ties. Thesedifferences were referred to as friendly disputes bySir Seewoosagar Ramgoolam  architect of ourindependence and father our nation. We hope to resolvethese differences through quiet diplomacy and dialogue.The cold war has died  but the need for peace andsecurity lives on. The state of affairs in the world todaychallenges us but must not daunt us. Against thisbackground  the principle of meliorism — that the worldmay be made better by human effort — should prevail inour actions. Those who have the means and capabilitiesto help should not waver or shy away at the call of theUnited Nations.14These are some of the ideas that I wanted to sharetoday. It is my hope that we will all join in a globalpartnership for the achievement of a better and strongerUnited Nations at the service of the peoples in whose namewe stand here."
"119",4941,"MWI",51,1996,"﻿Minister for Foreign AffairsLet me begin  Sir  byextending to you my heartfelt congratulations on yourelection to the high office of President of the fifty-firstsession of the General Assembly. Malawi holds you andyour great country  Malaysia  in very high esteem. Yourelection to preside over this important session  soon afterthe special commemorative session  surely demonstratesthe confidence that the international community as awhole has in you and your country. I have no doubt thatyou will guide the deliberations of the Assembly to asuccessful conclusion.Let me also pay tribute to your predecessor  HisExcellency Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral of Portugal  for3the very skilful manner in which he conducted thedeliberations of the fiftieth session. As we all know  theearlier part of that session coincided with thecommemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the UnitedNations  an occasion which attracted an unprecedentedgathering of world leaders as well as other high-levelrepresentatives. In spite of the demands which theceremony imposed on the Organization  Mr. do Amaral metthe challenge with admirable tact and tenacity. To him wewish to say “well done” for a job brilliantly executed.The fiftieth session of the General Assembly was amilestone in the life of the United Nations. It not onlysymbolized the coming of age of the Organization but gavedelegations an opportunity for serious reflection andappraisal of the various aspects of the Organization and itsoperations. It was therefore not surprising to us that reformwas  and continues to be  the main theme of thedeliberations.My delegation is pleased to note that reform of theOrganization is being pursued with vigour and a renewedsense of direction. Indeed  we cannot wish away theinspiring words of wisdom that came out of the statementsof the world leaders who addressed the Assembly duringthe Special Commemorative Meeting. The United Nationsneeds to be strengthened for it to respond fully to the manypolitical and economic challenges that face the world today.We all agree that now is the time for the SecurityCouncil to be democratized in such a way that itscomposition corresponds equitably with the increase in themembership of the Organization. Its working methods andprocedures also need to be enhanced in order to bring aboutmore transparency and accountability. The continuingdebate on this subject has clearly revealed to us theessential issues to be dealt with. We are encouraged bywhat seems to be an emerging spirit of accommodation onthe subject. It is our sincere hope that the hurdles thatremain ahead will be surmounted in the same spirit of giveand take. More significantly  it is necessary to bear in mindthat while the relevant Working Group is open-ended inspace  it is not open-ended in time. The sense of urgencywith which world leaders addressed the question of reformduring the commemorative ceremony demands that work onthis matter move forward resolutely.Even the most reformed United Nations cannotperform without the necessary resources. It is no secret thatthe operations of the Organization have in recent years beenhampered by financial constraints. We are encouraged bythe progress so far achieved in the High-level Open-endedWorking Group on the Financial Situation of the UnitedNations. We  however  would have liked more sustained action-oriented progress so that we could put to rest amatter which has greater implications  including for themorale of the staff of the Organization. We trust that thedeliberations will continue to address the issues in anopen and transparent manner. At the same time  it is oursincere hope that Member States will continue to honourtheir existing obligations without introducing linkages.Two years ago  the President of the Republic ofMalawi  His Excellency Mr. Bakili Muluzi  stood here atthis very rostrum to herald the dawning of a new era inMalawi on 17 June 1994  when Malawians ushered intheir first democratically elected Government after 30years of dictatorship. It is common knowledge that thenew Government inherited a multitude of problems withdebilitating consequences for the socio-economicdevelopment and welfare of the Malawian people.Undaunted by these enormous challenges  the newGovernment  soon after assuming power  put into placepolicies with the overall aim of reducing poverty andimproving education and social services  particularlyamong people living in rural areas. Two and a half yearson  the wide-ranging economic and structural reforms thatthe Government embarked upon are increasingly yieldingpositive results. General economic activity is expandingat a remarkable pace  inflation is coming down steadily public finances are in the process of being restored tosustainable levels  and the situation of the balance ofpayments and foreign reserves continues to improve  thusgradually restoring confidence in the economy.Most significantly  the liberalization of markets andrelative prices in commodities have increased work andproduction incentives and opened opportunities for manyMalawians. We remain committed to removing the fewremaining rigidities in the economy  which in the pasthave tended to cause discrimination against the commonman in the village. The opening up of the economy andthe expansion of opportunities for all will continue toguide us in pursuing our economic agenda. We are however  the first to realize that there are many stumblingblocks ahead.Malawi is a very small country  and is landlocked.Like other countries  we too have our own vision of abetter and more prosperous Malawi. Through our own2020 Programme  we hope to solicit the views of thevarious sectors of the national populace and chart thedirection of the country’s development to the year 2020.4So far  the public has shown considerable enthusiasm in theongoing consultations  in the same way that theyparticipated in the political transformation of the countrytwo years ago. It is our desire and commitment to controlour economic destiny. The level of expectation created bythe democratic dispensation needs to be matched byeconomic empowerment and social development. To haveit otherwise would be to compromise democracy.The Government and the people of Malawi appreciateand are thankful for the assistance which the internationalcommunity is rendering our country. We are hopeful thatthe international community will continue to help Malawirealize its dreams and its vision. We call upon ourdevelopment partners to continue to augment the assistancethat they are currently extending to the people of Malawi.We also wish to appeal to our cooperating partners to comeand invest in our country. The economic and investmentclimate is now more conducive than ever before.Malawi has welcomed with enthusiasm the launchingby the international community of programmes which aimat encouraging development in Africa. For the past fewyears  hope in the continent was fanned by the adoption ofthe United Nations New Agenda for the Development ofAfrica in the 1990s. The much talked about diversificationof the economies of African States was warmly received asa move which would strengthen the predominantly primaryraw material-producing basis of the countries’ economies.It is sad to note that the financial resources required for theprogramme have not matched the enthusiasm that revolvedaround the launching of the New Agenda. My delegationsincerely hopes that the mid-term review of the Agenda which has just concluded  will reignite the enthusiasm of usall and enhance the political will of all the cooperatingpartners.More recently  my Government welcomed thelaunching by the Secretary-General of the United NationsSystem-wide Special Initiative on Africa. Malawi isparticularly pleased with the innovative nature of theInitiative. The conferring of the leadership of theprogramme on the Africans themselves only confirms whatwe have always desired to see happen. In addition  thespecificity of the objectives sought under the Initiative is amove in the right direction. We commend the internationalcommunity for this programme and call upon the leadinstitutions not to waver at the implementation stage. Forour part  we stand ready to cooperate fully with the otherimplementing partners  and so far that is precisely what weare doing.Malawi is following with interest the current workon the elaboration of an Agenda for Development. Mydelegation notes that the basic guidelines for an Agendafor Development are well known and have already beennegotiated and agreed upon in the various United Nationsconferences and summits. What remains is essentially theimplementation of the action plans in a more integratedand innovative way  entailing political commitment by allactive members of the international community. We lookforward to an early conclusion of an Agenda forDevelopment. We in Malawi see all these initiatives ascomplementary to our own ongoing efforts to improve thewell-being of our people.Malawi notes with satisfaction the important rolethat the United Nations plays in the maintenance ofinternational peace and security in various parts of theworld. We welcome the steady progress which has beenachieved in Angola and hail the Government forhonouring its commitments. At the same time  we wish toappeal to the leadership of the National Union for theTotal Independence of Angola (UNITA) to adhere to theimplementation of the Lusaka Protocol and relatedagreements. We have always maintained that peace inAngola will be beneficial not only to the people ofAngola  a people tired of war  but also to our southernAfrican subcontinent as a whole.My Government remains disturbed by the recentdevelopments in Burundi. The July 1996 coup d’état wasa major setback to the democratic process  and wesupport the position taken by the Organization of AfricanUnity (OAU) and the countries of the Great Lakes region.We denounce the coup d’état. Malawi does not condoneany takeover of power by any party throughunconstitutional means. Quite frankly  we in Africa aresick and tired of this “disease”. We want the ballot boxto be the referee in African politics  once and for all.Coups d’états have contributed negatively to the fame ofour otherwise rich and beautiful continent. We remainconvinced that the Arusha process is the only credibleway of bringing about peace in Burundi. We thereforecall upon the military rulers in Burundi to pave the wayfor the resumption of the Arusha peace negotiations.The installation in August 1996 of an interimGovernment in Liberia led by Mrs. Ruth Perry gives usall hope that the warring factions have chosen the way ofpeace and reconciliation after years of the senselesskilling of innocent civilians. Malawi commends theleadership of the Economic Community of West AfricanStates (ECOWAS) for having successfully brokered the5peace plan among the warring factions. We reaffirm ourfaith in the Abuja Agreement and express the hope that theimplementation schedule agreed upon recently will lead tosuccessful elections next year. We call upon theinternational community to closely monitor developmentsand assist the ECOWAS Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) inthe noble work that it is carrying out in Liberia.There remains cause for genuine concern overdevelopments in Western Sahara. My Government hasnoted that for a long time now  progress has stalled overthe identification of eligible voters in the referendum. Therepeated extension of the mandate of the United NationsMission for the Referendum in Western Sahara(MINURSO) is a show of commitment by the internationalcommunity which should not be taken for granted. Malawitherefore calls upon the principal players in the process toshow some flexibility so that an amicable solution to thecurrent impasse can be reached.Developments in countries of the former Yugoslaviahave recently been encouraging. The cessation of hostilitiesin the Balkans under the Dayton Peace Agreement signedearly this year and the recent elections have generatedconsiderable hope within the international community. It isthe hope of my Government that no reckless moves will betaken which could jeopardize the existing momentumtowards stability.During the past few years considerable progresstowards a comprehensive peace settlement has been madein the Middle East. We have in the past expressed supportfor the peace initiative which  since its birth at Madrid on30 October 1991  has grown steadily and has given rise toimportant agreements between Israel and the PalestineLiberation Organization (PLO). We remain convinced thatthe path that was started in Madrid is the way forward. Wetherefore urge all the parties concerned to abide by theirprevious commitments and move forward to achieve theaspirations of the people of the region and the world. Therecent disturbing developments only show how thin thedividing line is between peace and violence.The international community has recently beenreminded  through violent clashes  of the volatile situationthat exists in divided Cyprus. The division  which aroseover two decades ago  remains a constant reminder that theinternational community has yet to boldly tackle thesituation there. My Government hopes that the issue ofCyprus will be pursued with commitment by both themediators and the parties concerned.It is the wish of my Government that the long-standing question of the international status of theRepublic of China on Taiwan will be peacefully resolvedin a manner acceptable to the Governments on both sidesof the Taiwan Strait. We are encouraged by the recentreported indications that the two sides are ready to talk toeach other. However  the Malawi Government wishes toreaffirm its commitment to the promotion of freedom human rights and democratic principles and thereforesupports the aspirations of the more than 21 millionTaiwanese people to recognition and full participation inall the activities of the international community.We and our prestigious Organization should bepreventing and resolving conflicts. We should not sit byas confrontation builds. Instead  we should find the timeto initiate dialogue and lasting solutions  and not alwayshave to wake up and respond to emergencies. Thebenchmark should not always be to please the stronger; itshould also be to support the weak and vulnerable andthose under stress. But apart from our trade interests  ourmoral obligation must be renewed every day.Let me conclude by reaffirming our faith in theUnited Nations. We believe the United Nations has a vitalrole to play in the maintenance of international peace andsecurity. Many areas of tension remain the world over.We urge the United Nations to act more resolutely indealing with these many troubled areas. The UnitedNations has made and continues to make a difference inthe lives of millions of people in many countries including my own  Malawi  in many areas of humanendeavour. We have no doubt that a reformed UnitedNations will contribute more to making the world a betterplace to live. We are confident  Sir  that under yourstewardship of the fifty-first session of the GeneralAssembly  we  the peoples of the United Nations  willhave taken another bold step towards a revitalized andreformed United Nations  a United Nations capable offully responding to the challenges of the twenty-firstcentury. Our prayer is  let us boldly resolve and goforward together to the next millennium."
"120",4987,"MYS",51,1996,"﻿I am happy toacknowledge a Malaysian as the President of the GeneralAssembly  a first for Malaysia. We are thankful to allMember States for their support  especially the members ofthe Asian Group  which endorsed Malaysia’s candidatureearly.I would like to think that the selection has to dowith Malaysia’s efforts and involvement  with the UnitedNations and globally. Within three years of Malaysia’sindependence  we were involved in United Nationspeacekeeping operations in the Congo. Today in Bosniaand Herzegovina  Malaysia is perhaps the only developingcountry participating in the peacekeeping forces led bythe North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)  payingin full the cost of our involvement. Malaysia will continueto participate in international activities  United Nations-sponsored or otherwise  combining altruism withenlightened self-interest.This time last year  there was much celebration asthe United Nations attained its fiftieth year. Amid thecelebrations extolling the achievements of the UnitedNations  there were serious concerns expressed about therelevance and effectiveness of this Organization and theneed for democratic reforms so that the United Nationscould better fulfil the purposes and principles of theCharter. The fiftieth anniversary came and went and despite the extravaganza  very little has been achieved.The Organization itself remains far removed fromthe aspirations of the peoples of the United Nations which it is supposed to promote and protect. Hopefully the tragedy of Bosnia and Herzegovina will  withinternational help  be on the mend  but Palestine’s hopesand aspirations have been undermined by the new IsraeliGovernment  which is backed  unfortunately  by someWestern Powers  and is backtracking on painfullynegotiated agreements. At this moment  a rash decision byIsrael not only imperils further the peace process  withlives being lost  but can inflame and outrage MuslimStates and Muslim society if the sanctity of the Al-AqsaMosque is defiled. In Africa  Somalia  Rwanda andLiberia remain on the razor’s edge of survival  andBurundi awaits United Nations and regional initiatives toavoid a catastrophe. And there are countries such asAfghanistan  victims of the cold war  abandoned by themajor Powers  needing help to reconstruct and overcomethe destruction wrought by war. And what will be the fateof tiny Chechnya and its valiant people  facing the fullonslaught of mighty Russia?While some developing countries becomefragmented and marginalized  the process of accruingpower and benefits continues with the major countries aided by their control of the Security Council  theirmonopoly on nuclear power and their economic highground. One sees various twists and turns  doublestandards and selectivity  as the dictates of domestic6politics overrule justice and humanitarianism ininternational affairs. Commitment to multilateralism is soqualified and investment in the United Nations so tentativethat common needs have often been sacrificed.Now  as the General Assembly begins its fifty-firstsession  we urge again that the international communitywork collectively for substantial change  reflecting a moreequitable sharing of political and economic power. This callfor reform is made even more urgent when we consider thatthe premises by which international relations are conductedtoday continue to perpetuate a grossly unjust system.The systematic abuse of power by the major countrieshas continued. They apply selective sanctions and doublestandards on the developing world to promote their narrownational interests. Clearly disregarding multilateralism  withits inherent qualities of mutual respect and shared interests the North continues its vice-like grip on all spheres ofinternational activity  including politics  international trade development  the environment and the media to name afew.Elitism exercised by the major countries is frequentlycloaked in the guise of globalism or of serving the commoninterests of nations. However even a cursory examinationof this brand of globalism reveals it to be sanctimonious  ifnot hypocritical. For example  under the pretext ofsafeguarding international peace and security  the nuclear-weapon States maintain their right to destroy  or threaten todestroy  all life on this planet. Yet these countries denyothers even the right to use conventional weapons for self-defence.Malaysia deeply regrets the lack of a consensus on theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty but welcomes itssubsequent adoption at the fiftieth session of the GeneralAssembly. We worry about nuclear aspirations in ourregion and in Israel. To a large extent  the refusal of thenuclear-weapon States to adopt a timetable for nucleardisarmament is responsible for this situation and seriouslyflaws the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.Malaysia is encouraged by the recent International Court ofJustice Advisory Opinion on the legality of the threat or useof nuclear weapons. To render the Court’s findingmeaningful  there should be serious efforts made towardsaccelerating the process of nuclear disarmament  includingthe early convening of a special session of the GeneralAssembly devoted to disarmament.While these major Powers advocate peace andcondemn arms races by others  their industries aggressivelydevelop and promote the sales of defence technologiesand weapons of death. Like a drug dealer supplying hishelplessly addicted victims  the northern-based armsindustries keep poor countries mired in a cycle of povertyand insecurity  laying waste vital human skills andresources.Perhaps such political elitism comes naturally tothese powerful countries  many of which were imperialPowers before. A clue as to their priorities for the globalagenda is to be found in the recent communiqué of theeconomic summit of the Group of Seven. Reform of theUnited Nations  in particular the Security Council  as anurgent issue  gave way to the pre-eminence of theglobalization of the world economy. And so  the SecurityCouncil remains a blunt instrument of the foreign policiesof the permanent members.In the context of a globalized world  much is madeof the terms “interdependence” and “mutual interests”.Multilateralism has been elbowed aside. Yetmultilateralism is the foundation of the internationalrelations and cooperation which the United Nationssymbolizes. From now on  globalization will take overand nations will lose their sovereignty.Consider the current financial crisis that faces thisOrganization. The United Nations is on the verge ofbankruptcy  being held to ransom by its major donorcountry  the wealthiest nation in the world. That countryrefuses to meet its assessed and legally due contributions yet insists on maintaining its hegemony on globalmanagement.The major Powers’ solution to the United Nationsstalemate is to speak of revitalizing the United Nations asif they were conducting a corporate downsizing exercise.While it is important to end bureaucratic inefficienciesand the wasteful use of resources  we should be mindfulthat the United Nations is not a business.Overconcentration on internal-management issues candeflect the attention of the United Nations from its majorglobal responsibilities. While Malaysia is critical of theUnited Nations and its leadership  we cannot but regretthe tendency of major Powers to assign the UnitedNations complex tasks  missions impossible  without clearmandates and authority or adequate resources. How doesthe United Nations undertake peacekeeping operationswithout the authority or the means to keep the peace?We find the inequities of power-sharing in theUnited Nations to be intolerable and view with alarm7prevailing trends towards weakening this Organizationfurther. Already  the centre of gravity for all principaleconomic decisions that affect developing countries lies inthe undemocratic Bretton Woods institutions  the WorldTrade Organization (WTO) and of course the self-appointedGroup of Seven.Strengthening multilateralism requires a reform of theBretton Woods institutions  which dominate thedevelopment scene. These institutions are operating againsttheir general mandate. Decision-making is undemocraticand untransparent. Despite their specific mandates tofacilitate development and regulate the internationalmonetary system  these institutions are used to disciplinethird-world countries and to act as debt collectors for therich North. It is salutary to note that the World Bankcollected a net amount of $7.2 billion in 1995 in debtrepayment over and above what it disbursed in aid to thepoor indebted countries and raked in a profit of almost $1.5billion. The International Monetary Fund has now becomean enforcer of the dictates of market lenders and isassuming the role of a global rating agency.The majority of poor developing countries are saddledwith unsustainable levels of debt that preclude them froma share of world prosperity and growth. Debt servicing oncurrent scales is untenable and debtor countries  as aconsequence  can do little to alleviate their poverty andmisery. The chilling numbers speak for themselves - moreis spent on servicing debt than on financing basicprogrammes for health care  education and humanitarianrelief.The reductions in the commitments for concessionalassistance by almost all the industrial countries mark aturning point in international development cooperation.Bluntly put  the rich have reneged on solemn commitmentsand pledges. The cut-backs in pledges for the replenishmentof international development assistance and theunwillingness to clear earlier arrears  triggered by aunilateral decision of the major contributor to scale back itscontributions  have led other donors to scale back theircontributions as well.Now that the concept of globalism is so intimatelylinked with international trade  it is important critically toexamine the realities of this so called “free trade”. Thepainfully long history of the Uruguay Round negotiationsshould have forewarned us that the WTO  althoughestablished as a rules-based multilateral organization toregulate international trade  will become answerable only tothe world’s wealthiest economic Powers. Like the BrettonWoods institutions  the WTO remains outside anyrelationship of accountability to the far more democraticUnited Nations General Assembly.During the Uruguay Round  the developing countriesdiscovered that  instead of negotiating international ruleson trade in manufactured goods  the rich countries of theNorth had widened the agenda and pushed forliberalization in economic areas where they clearly havean advantage  in particular  financial services andinvestments.Even though some countries of the South havebenefited from the liberalization of trade — and Malaysiais one of them — the General Agreement on Tariffs andTrade (GATT) nevertheless harbours new threats todeveloping and newly emerging economies. Not onlyhave the poor countries of the South to struggle uphillmerely to meet the basic needs of their peoples  but theyare now bullied into adjusting their economic policies tomeet their new obligations under GATT so that northern-based corporations can penetrate and capture theirmarkets. The poor may not reserve their markets forthemselves even when they have no capacity to penetratethe markets of the rich.Fair competition and level playing fields are only forthe rich. For example  their attempts to link theenvironment and labour standards to trade inmanufactured goods is a clear attempt to deny developingcountries their meagre competitive advantage. Therelationship between trade and labour standards emergednot because of a concern for the well-being of workers inpoor countries  but as protectionist moves aimed againstgrowing and competitively-priced imports from the South.To compound this unfair interpretation of themultilateral trade rules  we find that  when it comes to thetransfer of technology  the northern countries take afiercely anti-liberal stand  insisting that all WTO memberStates compulsorily introduce a set of national laws toprotect intellectual property rights. Since most patents areowned by the North  this in effect means legal protectionof their technological monopoly and a drastic curtailmentof the right of developing countries to have access to newtechnology.It appears  therefore  that the northern interpretationof “free trade” and “liberalization” are slogans that inreality mean liberalization when it benefits the North butprotectionism if it can block the South. Thus  while goodsand capital are permitted and encouraged to move around8the globe  labour and technology may not. Even as we areasked to submit to GATT rules and the WTO  we find onecountry blatantly undermining the WTO by enactingextraterritorial laws that must be submitted to by all nationsand their companies on pain of excommunication.The GATT also fails to protect the genetic resourcesof the South while allowing genetically modified materialsto be patented. We now have a situation where theft ofgenetic resources by western biotech transnationalcorporations enables them to make huge profits byproducing patented genetic mutations of these samematerials. To what depths have we sunk in the globalmarketplace when nature’s gifts to the poor may not beprotected but their modification by the rich becomesexclusive property?There are of course many winners and losers in theworld of the WTO  but we are concerned that the majorlosers will soon again be the poorest and most marginalizedcountries. A small number of developing countries  likeMalaysia  have benefited. But let me point out that ourgains have been achieved through thrift  productivity andthe ingenuity of our people  hard-earned fruits of ourlabour. Lest it be forgotten  our new-found prosperity hasalso benefited those in the developed countries. Ourproducts are competitively priced  thus contributing tolower inflation in the rich countries. Our prosperity hasprovided vast and expanding markets for the goods of richcountries  thus creating jobs and helping to lower theirunemployment rates.The term “globalization” has become the buzzword ofour times. In the G-7 communiqué  globalization was toutedas“a source of hope for the future ... responsible for theexpansion of wealth and prosperity in the world.”(A/51/208  annex II  para. 2)However  some would argue that globalization  with itsobjectives of breaking down borders and sucking thecountries of the world into one single economic entity  haseclipsed multilateralism or attempts to masquerade as thesame thing. Indeed  globalization has been described by therich as a“new global partnership for development”. (ibid. annex II  IV)If the current behaviour of the rich countries isanything to go by  globalization simply means the breakingdown of the borders of countries so that those with thecapital and the goods will be free to dominate themarkets. Colonies in the former British Empire willremember “Imperial Preference” when they were madethe exclusive markets of the metropolitan Power.Globalization can mean just that  except that the worldmarket will belong to the rich nations. Linkages tonon-trade issues will prevent the poor from everchallenging the rich  in the same way that the colonieswere not allowed to industrialize.We do indeed live in a brutal and unjust world where the astonishing developments in science andtechnology and our increasingly sophisticated knowledgebase are not matched by the ability of Governments tomarshal forces to overcome the social and economicinequities of their countries. The facts and figures arewell documented and widely known  but they are worthrepeating just to jog our conscience — if we still haveone. What are the universal values of this globalizedworld when increasing numbers of people in both theNorth and South live in abject poverty? A fifth of thehuman race — 1.3 billion people — lack access to themost basic necessities  such as food and clean drinkingwater  while preventable hunger and disease kill 35 000children throughout the world every day. The 1996 UnitedNations Development Programme’s Human DevelopmentReport states that  in the past 40 years  the richest 20 percent of people have seen the differential betweenthemselves and the poorest 20 per cent double.Are we expected to believe in the sincerity of therich countries when they talk about a new globalpartnership and the achievement of sustainabledevelopment  when the fact is that  today  we have over20 million environmental refugees in addition to an equalnumber of traditional refugees? Why should thedeveloping countries accept the twisted lexicon ofnorthern development-speak when “developmentassistance” means that the net flow of wealth from poorcountries to rich has increased to at least $400 billion ayear when the terms of trade  transfer pricing  debtservicing and the brain drain are taken into account.Wading through the obstacles of this strife-tornworld is a critical dilemma that faces the internationalcommunity today. It is one of international leadership andthe failure to deal with these critical issues. Instead  wewitness a persistent abnegation by the major Powers ofthe responsibilities that accompany the rights andprivileges of such authority. We must determine the type9of world and society we want to live in  and this should bebased on truly universal values.As we approach the next millennium and as thepre-eminence of transnational forces has blurred thedefinition of national sovereignty  we must seriouslyquestion why a powerful minority is still allowed tobankrupt and coerce the majority to meet its narroweconomic and political needs. The poor are no longerindependent. They have already lost control over their owncurrency. And now they have lost their borders too.Freedom of the press is touted as a basic democraticprinciple. But control of the media by a handful of westerncorporations has made nonsense of this principle.Proclaiming to be windows on the world  the westernmedia  manipulated and censored by those in control invariably manage to distort reports so as to put anythinghappening in the South in the worst possible light.Anything positive in the developing countries is ignored.The growth and influence of electronic  satellite andinformation technology is astounding. But its impact posesone of the biggest political and ethical challenges of ourtime  subverting and distorting our social consciousness.The elites of the North and the South have become blind tothe enormities of reality. Events and people are stripped oftheir context  so that we become less capable of recognizingthe common humanity and equal rights of all the people inthe world. Pictures of poverty and inequality are no longerreceived with moral outrage  but have become simple factsof life. Thus begins the process of dehumanization anddisengagement from the rest of human society.Although without a doubt the information age willbring cheap and easy access to knowledge and educationand facilitate worldwide business  its abuse is alreadyaffecting the moral values of the world. Smut and violencegratuitously distributed by criminals in the North are no lesspolluting than carbon dioxide emissions nor less dangerousthan drug trafficking.If one great Power can apply its laws to citizens ofanother country it considers to be guilty of drug trafficking why cannot countries with different moral codes extraditethe traffickers of pornography for legal action under thelaws of the offended countries? Why cannot there beinternational laws and international courts to punish thosewho spread filth and incite racial hatred and racialviolence? Before the whole world sinks deeper into moraldecay  the international community should act. Abuse of theubiquitous Internet system must be stopped.The monopoly of the electronic media by the Northshould be broken. As it is  we are getting slanted news made worse by broadcasters interpreting in favour of theirown or their countries’ interests. As usual  the poorcountries with no role in operating the international mediahave become the principal victims of world newsnetworks. Not only are distorted pictures of our countriesbeing broadcast  but our own capacity to understand whatis happening is being undermined. In the past  Westernmissionaries spread the Gospel. Today the media hastaken over  and all our cherished values and diversecultures are being destroyed.The United Nations has not always been a failure. Inits early years it helped to dismantle the empires ofWestern European countries. Malaysia is grateful to it  forit too won freedom because of the moral suasion of theUnited Nations. But the United Nations now seems blindto what is being done to Iraq and Chechnya. One greatPower continues its vendetta against Iraq  firing missilesat distant targets to bring the Iraqi leadership to its knees oblivious to the sufferings of the besieged Iraqi people.Another Power has shut the gates of mercy on theChechens  and with rockets and bombs has killedindiscriminately and with appalling brutality in order thatChechnya should remain part of an empire. How muchmore should the Chechens suffer before the SecurityCouncil takes notice? Where are the vaunted defenders ofhuman rights who claim that national borders will notstop them?It is a fact that every year many statements are madeat the United Nations that lament the crises of poverty third-world debt  human rights abuses  conflicts and wars social disintegration and environmental degradation. It isalmost boring. And yet nothing much has been donewhich could bring about an amelioration of this sad stateof affairs.Perhaps it is because the processes ofintergovernmental consensus decision-making of theUnited Nations are tedious and frustrating. Perhaps it ismismanagement by the Governments of so many poornations which afford many excuses for the rich not tohelp.It is of course easy to use the United Nations as aforum to unmask the hypocrisies of both the North andthe South  but it is more difficult to work collectively toimplement change and solve problems. Still  Malaysiabelieves that this repetitive criticism is valid andnecessary  that international injustice and oppression10should not be swept into the dustbins of history. I wouldlike to say again that Malaysia strongly believes in themultilateralism of the United Nations and is prepared toinvest in this international Organization with all ourstrength  beliefs and moral fibre."
"121",5014,"NAM",51,1996,"﻿Your election  Mr.President  represents a fitting tribute to you personally foryour well-known qualities as a consummate diplomat andto Malaysia for its constructive role in world affairs andremarkable success in economic development and socialintegration at home.I cannot forget the skilful and decisive role youplayed as President of the Security Council  in defence ofour interests  against attempts aimed at weakening theeffectiveness of the United Nations Transition AssistanceGroup in Namibia. Our two countries have since joinedhands in cooperative relations  which are growing fromstrength to strength. I congratulate you and wish youevery success in your challenging task.Your Prime Minister  Mr. Mahathir Mohamad  is agreat friend of the Namibian people. His eloquent voiceilluminates the burning international issues advocated bythe South. It also serves to define most clearly the basisof South-North dialogue  as well as the vital work beingdone for the developing countries by the Group of 77 andChina.Your predecessor  Mr. Diogo Feitas do Amaral earned himself a place of honour in the annals of historyby presiding over the fiftieth commemorative session ofthe General Assembly. I commend him for his valuableefforts and constructive contribution.Our illustrious Secretary-General  Mr. BoutrosBoutros-Ghali  has been a devoted champion of theCharter of the United Nations  a firm reformer and anindefatigable promoter of peace  social development andpeacekeeping throughout the world. Africa holds theSecretary-General in high esteem and supports his tirelessefforts in behalf of peace and a better future forhumanity  an outlook that is common to the Organizationof African Unity (OAU)  the United Nations and theNon-Aligned Movement.At the most recent OAU summit  held at Yaoundé African leaders demonstrated unity and solidarity byendorsing Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali for reelection asSecretary-General of the United Nations. Namibia standsbehind that decision.The fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations was acelebration of the success and durability of ourOrganization. At the same time  it was a celebration ofthe triumph of the will and determination of world leadersand citizens alike to conquer tyranny  hegemony  poverty 5illiteracy  social inequities and underdevelopment amidst thewealth and knowledge that abound in the world.President Nujoma had this to say last year  from thisrostrum:“During the past 50 years  this Organization hasserved humanity as a universal market-place of greatideas and collective action.”(Official Records of theGeneral Assembly  Fiftieth Session  Plenary Meetings 35th meeting  p. 10)President Nujoma has also said that the promotion ofworld peace and security was meant to save succeedinggenerations from the scourge of war and  moreover  topromote social progress and better standards of life inlarger freedom. These are living commitments for allnations and peoples and must be realized fully. They bindus together as members of one human race and as eachother’s keepers.You  Mr. President  issued a charge to the fifty-firstsession of the General Assembly in your acceptance speechon 17 September 1996. I thought its essence wasencapsulated in these words  which seemed to echo whatmy leader had said:“The United Nations must begin to embed itselfin reality and push the critical issues  especiallypoverty and social injustice  to the centre of nationaland public debate. What will it take to do this? Ofimmediate need is political will by Member States tocommit to the principles of democracy andaccountability. The nature of democratic practiceneeded for such an enterprise is one based on carefuldeliberation and consultation so that compromise tothe lowest value is minimized in favour of optimizingthe best options that will protect universal values.”(Official Records of the General Assembly  Fifty-FirstSession  Plenary Meetings  first meeting  p. 4)I could hardly agree more with those sentiments.I shall never be convinced  and I shall never succumbto the notion  that nuclear weapons assure world peace andsecurity  development  prosperity or equality among nations.On the contrary  I am convinced that peace  disarmament democracy  multilateral cooperation and resource allocationcan unleash human ingenuity and industry for developmentand social progress.It is for these reasons that Namibia insists oncomplete nuclear disarmament in all respects. The otherday I signed the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treatyon behalf of the Republic of Namibia  not out ofcomplete satisfaction but to encourage the ongoing worktowards disarmament  bearing in mind the constructiveand timely advisory opinion of the International Court ofJustice on nuclear weapons  as well as the Treaties ofPelindaba  Rarotonga and Tlatelolco  which creatednuclear-free zones in Africa  the South Pacific and LatinAmerica respectively.Africa is bleeding  just as the souls of our people the African people  are burning in misery and mayhem.Their precious humanity and lives have been denuded ofdignity and worth. How long must this carnage anddehumanization be allowed to continue in Somalia Burundi and other tormented places in Africa?The glimmer of hope in Liberia engendered by therecently concluded peace accord  brokered by Statesmembers of the Economic Community of West AfricanStates (ECOWAS)  and the inauguration of Mrs. RuthPerry as the first-ever woman Head of State in Africa must not be snatched away again by unscrupulous power-grabbers and political opportunists. Rather  the newlyinaugurated Head of State must be given all the supportshe needs to pursue a national course of democratization reconciliation and reconstruction for all Liberians.The long-standing partnership and cooperationbetween the Organization of African Unity (OAU) andthe United Nations should be brought to bear in theemerging favourable situation in Liberia with a view tostabilizing the transition and to preventing any militaryreversals. Just as peacekeeping cannot be successfulwithout international involvement  so also do regionalpost-conflict peace-building and reconstruction depend oninternational support to be successful. It is here wherepreventive diplomacy  peacekeeping and peacemakingcome together to do good for all.Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim  the very able andhardworking Secretary-General of the OAU  is anxious toapply in all those conflict situations  the Mechanism forConflict Prevention  Management and Resolution. But heis short of resources  including personnel  as well as ofappropriate capacity to do the job. Namibia will continueto make its contribution in spite of its limited means. Weurge the international community to render generousassistance to the OAU for this purpose.6Drug trafficking is a horrendous killer disease whichpermeates the social fabric of society. Drug lords arenotorious gangsters not unlike those responsible fororganized crime  with corrupting inroads into Governments businesses and civil society  targeting youth  students andeven small children. The member States of the SouthernAfrican Development Community (SADC) recently signeda protocol on drug trafficking in our region and agreed tocoordinate their law enforcement efforts to combat thismenace jointly.Today  the risk of dying due to anti-personnellandmines in many parts of the world has increasedastronomically. This risk exists in southern Africa as well mainly in Angola  but also in Mozambique and Namibia.This is another area in which SADC is combining theefforts of its members with a view to regional initiatives.Cooperation between SADC and the European Unionhas made it possible for us to benefit from resources andexpertise to deal more effectively with this very seriousproblem. That is why Namibia welcomes the initiativetaken on this matter by my colleague  Mr. Klaus Kinkel Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Federal Republic ofGermany  and supports his Seven-Point-Action Programmeon Anti-Personnel Mines.In this connection  we encourage other ongoinginitiatives aimed at banning anti-personnel landmines  aswell as the commendable work which some countries aredoing in the field of demining  including in Namibia.Namibia therefore supports the inclusion of a ban onanti-personnel landmines in the agenda of the forthcomingsession of the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva.In the interest of democratization and nationalreconciliation  and in order to mitigate the existing harshand racially biased social disparities which we inheritedfrom the apartheid order  Namibia has been pleading withthe United Nations and the rest of the internationalcommunity for least-developed country status. So far  thisplea has remained unheeded in the main  but  to be fair  notentirely. While renewing our plea  it is worthacknowledging with appreciation the implementation ofGeneral Assembly resolution 46/204  concerning “as if”least-developed country status  which has aided Namibia insome constructive ways. This was made possible by UnitedNations Member States  as well as by specialized agencies.We thank them all for their support and also for havingextended the “as if” least-developed status for an additionalthree years.We believe  as most do  that economic growth  jobcreation  human resource development and genderequality must be visible and qualitative in content ascritical weapons against social dislocations and strife.Without exception  during last year’s fiftiethanniversary commemoration of the founding of the UnitedNations  world leaders dealt  one way or another  with thedemocratization  restructuring and revitalization of theUnited Nations. This was as it ought to be. Systemicreform of the United Nations was already overduedecades ago.While the reform process itself is still very much oncourse  its forward momentum seems to have beendeflected for one reason or another.The common position shared by the Organization ofAfrican Unity (OAU)  the Non-Aligned Movement andother fair-minded bodies and persons is based on theprinciple of equitable representation and transparency interms of decision-making at all levels of ourOrganization.In this context  Africa  Asia and Latin America andthe Caribbean each deserve to be allocated at least twopermanent seats on the Security Council  as well as aconcomitant increase of non-permanent seats in the spiritof democracy and fairness. Namibia has already expressedon a number of occasions a position on the addition ofJapan and Germany as permanent members of theSecurity Council  but not in isolation of the representationenvisaged for the aforementioned three continents.At the same time  Namibia believes that the GeneralAssembly was not meant by the authors of the UnitedNations Charter to play second fiddle to any of the otherprincipal organs. It is a universal parliament of equalmembers with the same preoccupation for world peaceand security  as well as for human survival andprosperity.It stands to reason  therefore  that United Nationsreform must not end up by making the Assembly a rubberstamp of other principal organs  be it the Security Councilor the Economic and Social Council. We should like  inthe end  to see well-balanced and mutuallycomplementary organs and institutions of the UnitedNations system.Multilateralism is the essence of the United Nationssystem. Decisions taken by the majority of Member States7should not be changed in the interest of a few throughadministrative fiat. It is for the General Assembly itself  ifneed be  to reconsider or to change any programmeactivities or personnel requirements approved previously.In addition to reaffirming their continued commitmentto and strengthening  of South-South cooperation  themember States of the Group of 77 and China  in their latestreport  renewed their call for a just and predictablemultilateral trading system that would ensure the completeintegration of the economies of the South into the worldeconomy and the emerging international trading system.To this end  the South attaches great importance to thefirst Ministerial Conference of the World TradeOrganization  to be held in Singapore in December 1996.Namibia strongly supports this meeting.The 1993 Israeli-Palestinian peace accord and theestablishment of the Palestinian Authority raised hopes forlasting peace in the Middle East. Regrettably  bloodshedand enmity are once again threatening to derail the MiddleEast peace process.Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Arafat cannotafford to waste one more minute. An urgent one-on-onemeeting and joint action  which ought to be routine  to endthe vicious circle of violence should take place withoutdelay. The first step in this direction is putting animmediate end to the creation of new settlements and to thereconstruction work in the Old City of Jerusalem. Theinitiators as well as the supporters of the Madrid peaceprocess should also bring their weight to bear towardsrestoring the partnership for a comprehensive  just andlasting settlement  in the best interest of all parties in theMiddle East  especially in the exercise of self-determinationby the Palestinians and the establishment of an independentstate of their own.And  of course  we are not forgetting Bosnia. Namibiahopes that the progress achieved so far will continue andwill eventually lead to lasting peace and reconciliation inthe area.Namibia cannot have a split personality on thequestion of self-determination and decolonization. WesternSahara is crying out for self-determination anddecolonization. Only when these goals are fully realized canAfrica and the United Nations boast of the completepolitical emancipation of our beloved continent.Namibia welcomes the high-level contacts that theKingdom of Morocco and the Saharan Arab DemocraticRepublic (SADR) have commenced. I should like toentreat them to maintain and invigorate these encouragingpolitical talks. The objective we would all like to seeimplemented  I believe  is the early holding of a UnitedNations-sponsored referendum in which only the authenticSaharawis will be able to express their unfettered will andassume their destiny.There is an extensive update on Angola in theSecretary-General’s annual report. In his importantstatement of 23 September 1996 to this Assembly  mycolleague  Venancio de Moura  Foreign Minister ofAngola  provided representatives with useful additionalinformation on the worrisome situation in his country inclusive of constitutional and political issues.I can hardly add to this information. For Namibia nonetheless  the suffering of our Angolan brothers andsisters  not to mention the children  is of paramountconcern. The other concern we have in Namibia is aboutthe fast-approaching deadline of the presence of theUnited Nations Angola Verification Mission(UNAVEM III) in Angola  which includes financialimplications arising out of the obstacles and delays whichkeep cropping up in the implementation of the LusakaProtocol. Be that as it may  Namibia is bound by bloodand common destiny to stand with Angola. That is whyour military contingent attached to UNAVEM III willremain in Angola until the Mission is satisfactorilyconcluded.This week  the leaders of the Southern AfricanDevelopment Community Organ on Politics  Defence andSecurity  under the co-chairmanship of President RobertMugabe  will meet in Luanda to exchange views on thecritical situation in Angola and its implications for theregion  the United Nations and the world at large.President Nujoma will attend this crucial and timelymeeting.Before concluding  let me say that an enduringchallenge for the United Nations  now and into the nextcentury  is to reactivate multilateralism as the centrepieceof international relations and constructive cooperation inthe emerging world order.This new world order cannot be built with a coldwar mind-set characterized by confrontation  militaryintervention  economic blockade and political8assassinations. There is no place for it in today’s world ofcooperation and open trade.The General Assembly  where all United NationsMember States are represented  is the ideal forum forresolving the conflicts of interest of the haves and thehave-nots  guided by the principles of equality  justice andequity for all.Finally  let me end with President Nujoma’sconcluding words  spoken here last year:“The future belongs to the youth and children.Our collective duty must be to reinforce theirvision for a peaceful  harmonious and prosperousfuture in the spirit of brotherhood andcooperation”. h"
"122",5059,"NER",51,1996,"﻿Itgives me great pleasure to convey to Mr. Razali Ismailthe heartfelt congratulations of the delegation of Niger onhis outstanding election to the presidency of the UnitedNations General Assembly at its fifty-first session. Hiselection is testimony to the high esteem and prestigeenjoyed by his country  Malaysia  in international affairsfor its contribution to the attainment of the ideals of ourOrganization. It is also recognition of the fact that he isa seasoned diplomat and a man of great experience.I extend my congratulations to the other officers ofthe Assembly  and we assure Mr. Razali of the fullcooperation of the delegation of Niger in the discharge ofhis duties. I should like to convey to his predecessor Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral of Portugal  our greatpleasure at  and our compliments on  the excellent job hedid during his presidency.The President of the Republic of Niger  GeneralIbrahim Maïnassara Barré  reaffirms his unreservedsupport for and encouragement to the Secretary-General Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for his tireless efforts forpeace and development. As the Assembly knows  thissupport was demonstrated to the Secretary-General at therecent Summit of Heads of State and Government of theOrganization of African Unity (OAU)  when my countryjoined the unanimous tribute to him.I know that my country’s decision to propose one ofour sons as a possible candidate for the post of Secretary-General has given rise to much comment. Let me heremake it clear that Mr. Hamid Algabid  the candidate inquestion  is simply a “candidate for the candidacy”. Inother words  if in the coming weeks no veto opposes there-election of Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali as Secretary-General  Africa would only stand to gain. It would beperfectly normal for a son of our continent  who is just asqualified as his predecessors  to enjoy  as they did  asecond mandate at the head of our distinguishedOrganization.The annual session of the General Assembly givesmy country an opportunity to renew its faith in the idealsand principles of the United Nations Charter. The fiftiethanniversary of our Organization  which wecommemorated last year  gave us an opportunity to lookat the progress made and to define the priorities on whichwe should focus. Among those priorities is joint action bythe international community to reduce the economicimbalance between the nations of the North and thenations of the South. Unfortunately  the map of economic24and social development of the world contains a geographyof contrasts and disparities  although there were reasonablehopes that the end of the cold war would facilitate themobilization of the international community fordevelopment.Everywhere  and more specifically in the countries ofthe South  poverty is the greatest threat to political stabilityand social cohesion. The destitution of the shanty towns the destitution of the street children  and absolute povertyare a disgrace to us all  and they will be as long as we seemarginalization as inevitable. As the Director-General ofthe United Nations Educational  Scientific and CulturalOrganization  Frederico Mayor  stated so well:“From poverty to marginalization  frommarginalization to exclusion: this is how the mostfertile breeding ground for violence is created.”It is this violence which we must avoid  by offeringbetter alternatives to the peoples to whom we areresponsible — most particularly in Africa. Indeed  thiscontinent shows signs of being a land full of vitality capable of major economic achievements  if theinternational community gives us a chance and theresources. Accordingly  the commitments jointly enteredinto in the United Nations New Agenda for theDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s are as relevant as ever.And more than ever they require that greater efforts bemade for Africa by other members of the internationalcommunity.The question of external debt  and in particular thequestion of multilateral debt  which was given specialattention at the G-7 summit in Lyon deserves radical urgent treatment. Niger fully supports the recommendationsadopted at the mid-term review of the United Nations NewAgenda for the Development of Africa. We welcome thelaunching on 15 March 1996 of the United Nations System-wide Initiative on Africa. We hope that this programme which is in any case an important framework forcooperation  will make it possible to ensure sustainableeconomic and social development in Africa.Official Development Assistance — quite rightlyidentified as one of the main conditions for therevitalization of the African countries — should beincreased to the level indicated in the resolutions adoptedon this subject. At the upcoming Singapore meeting of theWorld Trade Organization appropriate follow-up actionshould be taken to ensure that the rights and interests of allcountries  and in particular of the African countries  beprotected. Likewise  the provision of technical andfinancial assistance to implement horizontal and verticalpolicies to diversify exports will give African countriesthe means for greater economic independence.Since the end of the cold war  our Organization hascertainly had some success in the maintenance ofinternational peace and security. Among these successeswas the coming into being of a democratic and multiracialSouth Africa and the end of the disastrous war inMozambique. We have also made significant progress inthe peace process in Angola  in the crisis in the MiddleEast and in the former Yugoslavia  in particular theholding a few days ago of elections in Bosnia andHerzegovina. Niger is following closely the effortsundertaken by the authorities in Rwanda to overcome theaftermath of the tragic events we all witnessed and inparticular to consolidate national reconciliation and lastingpeace.The situation in Liberia has seen a change for thebetter after the recent Economic Community of WestAfrican States (ECOWAS) summit devoted to thatcountry. Niger supports the recommendations whichemerged from it and has decided  despite our ownfinancial difficulties  inter alia  to strengthen the structureof the ECOWAS Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) inLiberia by sending a contingent of about 500 men. Mycountry believes  however  that these efforts will only besuccessful with the valuable support of the internationalcommunity  which inter alia must honour itscommitments to this country.I take this opportunity tocommend the tireless efforts made in Liberia by Nigeria the great friend and brother of Niger.Somalia also deserves support. My country has beenfollowing with great interest the evolution of the situationin Western Sahara and hopes for a resumption of dialoguebetween the two main protagonists there so that  in thenear future  efforts by made by the United Nations willfinally lead to the self-determination referendum whichthe international community hopes to see. Concerning thesanctions imposed on Libya  Niger believes that theconstructive proposals made by the authorities of thatcountry provide a serious basis for negotiations to resolvethat crisis  the consequences of which are adverselyaffecting the Libyan people as well neighbouringcountries.In the Middle East  for three years now  considerableprogress has been made on the path to peace. Untilrecently  President Arafat  living among his own people 25was developing a dialogue with his former enemies that while certainly difficult  was also useful. With the supportof the international community  that dialogue must go on.But unfortunately  since the return of the right wing topower in Israel  all hopes seem to have been dashed. OurOrganization must shoulder its responsibilities and doeverything in its power to stop the Middle East fromplunging into a new war with unforeseeable consequences.If the State of Israel has the right to exist and to live inpeace  the same goes for all States in the region —beginning with Palestine.Niger is similarly concerned about the serious situationin Jammu and Kashmir and hopes that the internationalcommunity will discuss it further. It is indispensable that inthat region of the world as well  and with theencouragement of all countries of good will  that wisdomand dialogue prevails  so that in the near future the peopleof Kashmir can finally exercise freely their inalienable rightto self-determination.Disarmament and the non-proliferation of weapons ofmass destruction  including nuclear weapons  have a centralrole to play in conflict prevention and the promotion ofpeace and economic and social development. This is whyNiger renews its appeal for universal accession tointernational conventions and treaties that relate to weaponsof mass destruction  and in particular to the cornerstonetreaty: the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of NuclearWeapons.Further efforts should be made to control conventionalweapons and  generally speaking  to establish confidence-building measures among States. The signing of the Treatyof Pelindaba  on the creation of a nuclear-weapon free zonein Africa  was a source of legitimate pride. My countrywelcomes the adoption here in New York of the importantComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty  which finally putsan end to the fears of millions of human beings for theirlives and for their environment. It is certainly a significantstep towards nuclear non-proliferation. Niger was amongthe sponsors of the resolution submitted by Australia  andwill be signing the Treaty in the near future. We hope thatthis stage  which puts an end to the risks of horizontalproliferation  will lead to a substantial reduction in existingarsenals.Finally  as in previous years  my country will join ininitiatives to be taken to combat illicit trafficking in smallarms. It will also join the increasingly unanimouscondemnation by the international community of themanufacture and use of those deadly devices: anti-personnel landmines.The building of a better world  which is our commongoal  is still dependent on the establishment ofinternational relations based on the principle ofcooperation and human solidarity. We have had majordiscussions on this subject: in Rio on the environment  inCairo on population  in Copenhagen on socialdevelopment  in Beijing on the promotion of women  inIstanbul on human settlements  and soon  in Rome  onfood. All the concerns of humanity have been taken intoaccount in the many important recommendations whichemerged from those conferences and which outlined avision of a better world. We believe that only genuinehuman solidarity can transform that vision into reality.Before concluding  I would like to provide anoverview of the political solution in my country. Niger isone of the African countries which  early on  chose thepath of democracy. In less than five years  it has triedeverything: a national conference  democratic transition and free and transparent elections which established theinstitutions of our Third Republic. Following the dismissalof the Government by the National Assembly  and thedissolution of that Assembly by the President of theRepublic  the ensuing elections brought about the victoryof the opposition and the establishment of a power-sharing regime marked by institutional instability in whichthe higher interests of the country were sidelined. Theresulting paralysis of State structures prompted the armyto seize power. Understand me clearly: I have no wish tojustify military coups d’état. But in Niger  the putsch wasthe lesser evil. At least that is how it was perceived bythe people of Niger  who spontaneously organizeddemonstrations in support of the new regime.As I speak to you now  Niger  having elected a newPresident  General Ibrahim Baré Maïnassara  is nowpreparing for legislative elections. The Government isdoing this in cooperation with the opposition  which onlylast week finally agreed to hold discussions with therepresentatives of the presidential party and to define withit the conditions for organizing future popular elections.The two parties have agreed to abandon sterile polemicsand to create the calm conditions so necessary to workeffectively in the higher interests of Niger.This shows that Africa in general  and Niger inparticular  is not allergic to democracy. But in the matterat hand  what my country wants is to be given theopportunity to build to its democratic system — based 26without question  on respect for human rights andfreedoms — at its own pace  taking into account its ownpolitical  economic  social and cultural context. And Iventure here to say that one of the dominant features ofAfrican culture is that we do not turn public administrationinto a dichotomy between those in power and theopposition  between those responsible for running thecountry and those who are excluded from that process. InAfrica  we do everything together. We work together  weeat together and we manage things together. Of course  inthe interest of the human community to which everyonebelongs  everyone should know his rightful place in thisprocess and everyone should play the role he has beengiven.In this regard  I would like to add that even just inour subregion  West Africa  there are several examples ofcountries that have understood this process and that arefruitfully applying it on a daily basis. This is the case ofSenegal and Burkina Faso. Let us try to find in ourculture — or better in our cultures — all the elementsthat can enable our countries to establish a viable properly adapted democracy  while also rejectingcategorically any kind of ready-to-wear democracy thatmight be foisted upon us.In conclusion  allow me to reaffirm Niger’s faith inthe ideals of the United Nations and in its ability to findin the solidarity of all its Members appropriate responsesto the new challenges facing humanity."
"123",5105,"NGA",51,1996,"﻿On behalf of the Nigeriandelegation  I convey to Mr. Razali Ismail ourcongratulations on his election as President of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-first session. His election is arecognition of his wide-ranging experience  candour anddiplomatic skills. It is also a tribute to his great country.We are confident that  under his presidency  the work ofthe General Assembly will be highly successful.May I also convey the appreciation of my delegationto his predecessor  Mr. Diogo Freitas Do Amaral ofPortugal  for the admirable manner and great sense ofcommitment with which he conducted the affairs of thefiftieth session of the Assembly. Nigeria also commendsMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali for the energy  sense ofpurpose and direction which he has brought to bear on theoffice of the Secretary-General in the meritorious serviceof our Organization.When we met last year to commemorate the fiftiethanniversary of the United Nations  we observed that anumber of developments on the political and economicscene had affected relations between States and modifiedthe configuration of power at the global level. We9recognized that the United Nations continues to be a viableinstrument for the conduct of relations amongst States. Werededicated ourselves to the principles and objectives of theUnited Nations Charter  including  in particular  thepromotion of social and economic development and themaintenance of international peace and security. In thisendeavour  the United Nations has a central role to play.Member States  in line with their obligations under theCharter  have a duty to assist the United Nations in carryingout this responsibility. This requires the politicalcommitment of all Member States and in particular of thoseupon which the Charter confers special status.Some of the developments which have occurred on theinternational scene include the globalization of the worldeconomy  the upsurge in market economies  the rise ineconomic growth in a number of countries and the growingtrend towards political pluralism and democratization.However  new forms of conflict  new nationalisms terrorism  an increasing incidence of poverty and globalsocial decline have cast a sombre shadow on internationalpeace and security  as well as on economic growth anddevelopment. The growing incidents of conflict  whether inEurope  in Africa or in the Middle East  and the slow paceof their resolution  are helping to exacerbate internationaltension and undermine confidence among States. TheUnited Nations has a duty in this regard to redefine its roleand sharpen its peacemaking and peacekeeping tools inorder to effectively address them.Peace is indivisible. The burden of peace  therefore should be shared by all in a mode of global responsibilityand partnership. Let me add also that the maintenance ofinternational peace and security is not an exclusiveresponsibility of the United Nations. Regional andsubregional arrangements have important roles to play andhave demonstrated their commitment.Although many regions of the world are nowwitnessing one form of conflict or another  with varyingdegrees of implications for the United Nations system  noregion perhaps is more afflicted by this menace than Africa both in the number of conflicts currently raging and in theirunimaginable negative effects on the people. The individualand collective efforts of African States to achieve socio-political transformation have been threatened by theseconflicts. In spite of this  the States of Africa havecontinued to make concerted efforts at regional andsubregional levels to address this situation. The unique rolebeing played by the Organization of African Unity (OAU)Mechanism for Conflict Prevention Management andResolution is important and should be supported by theinternational community. Nigeria welcomes thecooperation between the OAU and other regionalorganizations and the United Nations in the field ofpreventive diplomacy  peacekeeping and peacemaking.In our own subregion  the Economic Community ofWest African States (ECOWAS) undertook anunprecedented initiative in crisis management byestablishing a peacekeeping force  the ECOWASMonitoring Group (ECOMOG)  in Liberia six years ago.In spite of the difficulties we have encountered in theprocess  we remain committed in our endeavour to helpthe Liberian process reach its logical conclusion. In thisregard  Nigeria shares the view of many observers whohave described the revised Abuja peace agreement ofAugust 1996 as providing the best legal framework forthe resolution of the Liberian crisis. I am pleased toreport that the implementation of the Agreement revisedat Abuja last August is now on course. A new Council ofState  headed by Mrs. Ruth Perry  has been installed.Since her installation  Mrs. Perry has enjoyed theconsiderable confidence of the other members of theLiberian National Transitional Government and indeed ofmost Liberians. I take this opportunity to appeal to allLiberians to extend cooperation to the new leadership inthe interest of peace in their country. Let me assure theAssembly that it is the determination of my Head ofState  General Sani Abacha  Chairman of ECOWAS —in collaboration with other leaders in our region and withthe support of the international community as a whole —to ensure the resolution of the Liberian crisis.It is our expectation that the Liberians themselveswill assume their destiny in favour of peace  nationalreconciliation and national reconstruction. We thereforerenew our appeal to the international community toprovide much-needed financial  material and logisticsupport to enable ECOMOG and the United NationsObserver Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL) to effectivelydischarge their respective mandates. Meanwhile  weacknowledge with appreciation the renewed cooperationand assistance with the ECOWAS effort of some of themembers of the international community.Of great importance to the search for peace in thevarious troubled spots of the world is the urgent need tocontrol the instruments of war. It is a matter of deepregret that the end of the cold war has not ushered in inits wake any appreciable reduction in the global armsbuild-up. As the arms build-up and the proliferation ofconflicts are mutually reinforcing  there is an urgent needfor the international community to contain the trend. The10threat posed by existing stockpiles of weapons of massdestruction and conventional armaments is yet to beremoved.The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) a priority item on the disarmament agenda of the UnitedNations  has been adopted. In spite of the imperfections ofthis Treaty  the Nigerian Government was able to supportit and will be signing it in due course. Its adoption  whichputs an end to the further qualitative improvement ofnuclear weapons and arsenals  represents a significant firststep towards the goal of nuclear disarmament. It is ourexpectation that the Conference on Disarmament  the singlemultilateral negotiating body on disarmament  will now takethe next logical step to negotiate such disarmament withina time-bound framework. The nuclear-weapon States havea clear responsibility and duty to cooperate with theConference on Disarmament to negotiate such a treaty.The adoption of the Treaty of Pelindaba creating anuclear-weapon-free zone in Africa has been an importantcontribution to confidence building in Africa  in addition tobeing a collateral disarmament measure. In view of theoverwhelming support enjoyed by the Treaty beyond theAfrican continent  it is recommended that other regionsundertake similar efforts by establishing nuclear-weapon-free zones or zones of peace. While it is commendable toobserve that the majority of nuclear-weapon States havesince signed the protocol to the Treaty  we take thisopportunity to urge other States that have not yet done soto do so  in order that the full objectives of the Treaty canbe achieved.Peace and development are mutually reinforcing. Ajust and enduring peace can only be founded on the generalwelfare and socio-economic progress of all peoples and allnations. It is indeed disconcerting to note that while thecountries of the North are becoming more affluent  thecountries of the South  which contain the majority of theworld’s population  are getting more impoverished. Wemust collectively recognize and accept the fact that thedeepening crisis of development faced by developingcountries can only undermine the new world order whichwe seek to create.Africa  in particular  has continued to experience thecrippling impacts of external debt  deteriorating terms oftrade  increasing barriers to trade  declining investment andfinancial inflows  and capital flight. African countriesrecognize that the primary responsibility for finding asolution to the economic difficulties facing the continentlies with themselves. Hence they have sought to put inplace sound macro-economic policies and adopted verypainful programmes of economic reform. However  theirbest endeavours have continued to be constrained by theprevailing unfavourable international economic climate.We believe that development cooperation should engendergenuine interdependence  mutual interest and benefits inthe context of global partnership  rather than the old modeof a donor-recipient relationship.We must recognize the central role of the UnitedNations in engendering the process of globaldevelopment. In this regard  my delegation calls for fasterprogress in the ongoing work on the Secretary-General’sAgenda for Development. In the same spirit  we of theAfrican continent urge the international community todeliver on its promises under the United Nations NewAgenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s (UN-NADAF). We have just taken part in the mid-term reviewof its implementation. We recognize that UN-NADAF hashad a poor record of implementation. None the less  theUnited Nations system and the international communityat large must deliver on their various commitments.Nigeria considers as complementary the Secretary-General’s United Nations System-wide Special Initiativefor Africa  particularly as it envisages collaboration andcoordination of efforts between the internationalcommunity  the Bretton Woods financial institutions andthe United Nations development agencies on the issue ofdevelopment. In recognition of its role as the centre forthe harmonization of the actions of nations  the UnitedNations successful hosting of major global conferences ondevelopment — from New York in 1990 through Rio in1992  Vienna in 1993  Cairo in 1994  Copenhagen andBeijing in 1995  to Istanbul in 1996 — deserves ourspecial commendation. The faithful implementation of thedecisions and programmes of action of these conferenceswould assist in bridging the yawning gap between thedeveloping and the developed economies and constitute asubstantive benefit to development. Accordingly  weendorse and will continue to give our unqualified supportto the hosting of a special session of the GeneralAssembly in 1997 to review the implementation ofAgenda 21.It is hardly necessary to recall that contemporaryinternational relations were founded on the basis ofrespect for the principles of sovereign equality of States non-interference in the internal affairs of other States andpeaceful co-existence. It is therefore a matter of greatconcern that these hallowed principles are increasinglybeing eroded by some powerful States. The UnitedNations should serve as the bulwark against the impositionof the will of the strong over that of the weak.Today all countries are engaged in a universal questfor human dignity. It is no longer sufficient for us to becontent that our nations have been liberated fromoppression and foreign domination. It is now universallyacknowledged that the full meaning of national sovereigntycannot be realized unless the individual citizen is free toexercise his true conscience. The rise of this newinternational conscience is a legitimate extension of theearlier emergence of the new international morality whichthrew colonialism into disarray.There ought to be no conflict between nationalsovereignty and the fundamental rights of the individual.We welcome the growing international concern with humanrights  but unless we are careful to strictly define theparameters of what actions justly constitute human rightsand what are excesses threatening the security of the Stateas well as the safety and well-being of the citizens  wecould unwittingly be doing a disservice to the essence ofhuman freedom and dignity. We must therefore guardagainst the use of human rights as a pretext for advancingthe individual or collective interests of one section of theinternational community against those of the other.In today’s world  the collation  delivery andmanagement of information has become an essentialcomponent of development. Countries which are betterendowed technologically have tended to use thatendowment to the disadvantage of the less endowed. Thereis a need therefore to establish a New World InformationOrder  which respects the mutual sensitivities of States andprotects the values of their differing cultures.Most developing countries lack the resources andtechnological capacity for the requisite information delivery.This  in no small measure  constrains their ability to projectnews of events in their society promptly and effectively avoiding the tendentious reporting of the media in thedeveloped countries. Nigeria’s desire to be friends with allnations  our commitment to the maintenance of internationalpeace and security and our abiding faith in the principlesenshrined in the charters of the United Nations  theOrganization of African Unity (OAU) and our subregionalorganization  ECOWAS  are demonstrable and beyondquestion. It was therefore a matter of surprise to theNigerian Government that this Assembly  in December1995  adopted resolution 50/199 of 22 December 1995 onthe human-rights situation in our country. We believe thatthis action was based largely on media reporting andwithout any investigation of the facts of the matter. Inspite of the fact that the Nigerian Government was nothappy with that action  we subsequently took the initiativeto invite the Secretary-General to send a fact-findingmission to Nigeria to ascertain the realities on the ground.That mission visited the country from 28 March to 13April 1996  and conducted its work unfettered. While themission’s report identified areas of progress in ourdomestic situation  it also made constructiverecommendations. I would like to take this opportunity toexpress the appreciation of the Government and thepeople of Nigeria to those Governments which took aprincipled position of not supporting the resolution againstus. We note with satisfaction that since the UnitedNations visit  a growing number of countries havereconsidered their position on the matter in favour ofNigeria. We therefore urge the Assembly to takecognizance of these positive developments.The present Administration in my country hascontinued to make steady progress in the implementationof its programme of transition to democratic rule. Thefundamental difficulties which faced our nation in itsprevious efforts at building a viable democracy are beingprogressively addressed  taking into account the objectiverealities of our national situation  so as to ensure anorderly transition and the establishment of durabledemocratic structures of governance at all levels in ourcountry. We are encouraged by the successful outcome ofthe elections which were conducted at the localgovernment level in March this year. The impressiveturnout of voters nationwide and the general atmosphereof tranquillity prevailing in our country have elicitedgoodwill and support from within and outside the country.Political parties have now been registered and fullpolitical activities have resumed nation-wide. Ourtransition to civil rule is now fully on an irreversiblecourse.In our resolve to ensure that the evolving democraticinstitutions take root in a fertile economic environment the Nigerian Government has undertaken economicreforms aimed at promoting rapid growth and sustainabledevelopment. The overall macroeconomic performance ofthe economy has improved with the implementation ofdeflationary fiscal and monetary measures. Efforts areongoing to establish a conducive environment for thepromotion of investment  both domestic and foreign.Additionally  in recognition of the vital role of finance inthe attainment of greater economic efficiency  a wholesaleoverhaul of the banking and financial services sector hasbeen undertaken to sanitize this important sector of the12national economy. It is also worthy of mention thatnecessary instruments have been put in place in order tointensify economic deregulation and create a conduciveenvironment for domestic and foreign investment.In the year 2010  Nigeria will be 50 years old as anindependent and sovereign nation. It is envisaged that bythat date  Nigeria will have achieved economic prosperity political stability and social harmony. In order to realizethis objective  our Government announced  a few weeksago  a new socio-economic campaign  “Vision 2010”  toprovide insights into and articulate the goals and objectivesof our national economy in a macroeconomic format. It isalso intended to focus on the contribution of the privatesector as the engine of growth of our economy. We urgethe international community to give this programme thenecessary support and encouragement.In order for the United Nations to respond fully to thepurpose for which it was established  there is need tostrengthen the Organization and to reform its principalorgans. Such reform must be system-wide and must beundertaken not for its own sake but to achieve efficiencyand effectiveness. It should aim to enhance rather thanweaken the capacity of the United Nations to respondeffectively to the legitimate aspirations of all its Members.A vibrant and responsible United Nations requires anassured financial base. The failure or unwillingness ofMember States to pay their assessed contributions as andwhen due is a dereliction of Charter obligations and a threatto the survival of the United Nations. For our part  Nigeriahas continued to pay in full and without conditions ourassessed contributions to the regular budget including  inparticular  for the year 1996. We therefore call on allMember States that have yet to do so to pay their assessedcontributions promptly  in full and without conditions.For several decades  the Middle East question hasengaged the attention of the international community.Nigeria has been concerned with the various wars and actsof terrorism which have brought incalculable loss of lifeand property to that region. There can be no question butthat we will continue to support the just struggle of thePalestinian people for their inalienable right to a homeland.There is an increasing awareness  even among the countriesof the region  that the right of Israel to live within safe andsecure borders can no longer be denied. We call on allparties to intensify their efforts to ensure that the peaceprocess in the Middle East remains on course.For some time now  the world has been faced witha new upsurge in terrorist incidents. Nigeria condemnsunreservedly all acts of terrorism in all its manifestations as terrorism cannot be a substitute for dialogue andpeaceful negotiations in resolving conflicts andmisunderstandings between nations. We call on theGeneral Assembly to take additional steps to eradicate thescourge of this menace  which also constitutes a threat tointernational peace and security.As the principal organ of the United Nations  theSecurity Council is in dire need of reform. Itscomposition must reflect the principle of equity  balanceand equitable geographical distribution. It must seek tocorrect the current anomaly of the non-representation ofAfrica in the permanent membership category.We should  however  be mindful that reform of theUnited Nations  particularly in a period of transition  is anonerous undertaking. My delegation recognizes the vitalrole of the office of the Secretary-General in overseeingthis reform process. In spite of the difficulties the UnitedNations is passing through and the fluidity of theinternational situation  His Excellency Mr. BoutrosBoutros-Ghali has shown uncommon and unrelentingcommitment to meeting the challenges of his office. Hedeserves our gratitude and continued support. Wetherefore wish to see him complete the laudable changeshe has initiated  some of which are already yieldinguseful results. In this connection we reiterate and supportfully the collective African position that Africa should begiven the opportunity to serve two terms in the office ofSecretary-General. For that purpose  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali is the only candidate recommended by theOrganization of African Unity. Like his predecessors Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali should be given a second termto serve our Organization. It is the only credible thing todo. This is a matter of principle in our country.My delegation recognizes the enormous tasks facingthe Organization as it seeks to concretely address thechallenges of the twenty-first century  and we wish toreaffirm Nigeria’s commitment to continue to contributeeffectively to the realization of the Organization’s twinobjectives of global peace and prosperity."
"124",5150,"NIC",51,1996,"﻿Allow me to begin by congratulating the President on hiselection to preside over the Assembly this session. We areconvinced that he will guide our work successfully. Wewould also like to take this opportunity to thankMr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral for his work.In 1990  when Mrs. Violeta Barrios de Chamorrobecame President of Nicaragua  the country was in a stateof war. Negotiating the demobilization of more than20 000 people who had taken up arms and reducing anarmy of over 90 000 soldiers were key tasks in ending acivil war that had lasted almost 10 years. This19complicated pacification process was just the beginning ofa process of peace  reconciliation  democracy anddevelopment in Nicaragua aimed at bringing the countryinto line with the new situation in the region and theglobalization of international relations.As part of this process  we began to modernize theState  curbed hyper-inflation  liberalized the pricing systemand did away with the State monopoly in the areas offoreign trade and finance  where we have managed toprivatize almost all the companies that used to belong to theState.As the State apparatus was reduced  we began todecentralize government and transfer responsibilities tomunicipal and community levels and to sectors in which theprivate sector could clearly be much more effective.We have carried out the process of peace andreconciliation that was essential for democratic nationalconsolidation. We have stabilized the economy and reducedthe external debt  although  unfortunately  it is still a greatburden.One of the main concerns of the Government ofPresident Violeta Barrios de Chamorro has been to ensurethat the human rights of the entire population of Nicaraguaare respected. To this end  we have adopted legislative andadministrative provisions that have rid Nicaraguan jails ofmurder  torture and impunity.We have set up new institutions that encourageeducation  trade and banking. We have introduced a new much more effective  social security system. We haveallocated more of our budget to primary and technicaleducation  and we can be proud of the unlimited freedomof the press in Nicaragua today. We have also managed toestablish civilian control over the military  which will beanother important bequest to the new Government.Today our country enjoys the greatest degree ofpolitical freedom in its history. Considerable progress hasbeen made in institutionalizing democracy  and theresources that in the past we Nicaraguans used for war arenow once again being used for education  health and thebuilding of housing and roads — in other words  for thecomprehensive development of Nicaragua.Democracy in Nicaragua was born in 1990  with theelection of President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro in theonly truly free election ever enjoyed by the Nicaraguanpopulation in its history. At that difficult time  weNicaraguans accepted the challenge of sowing the seedsof a new culture of peace. The United Nations played avery important role in this process of achievingdemocracy and opening up a new era for Nicaragua. Inthe same spirit  the United Nations is now cooperatingwith us and providing guidance for the elections later thisyear.Since 1990 major changes have occurred at theworld level. Many countries have rid themselves ofoppression and dictatorship. The Iron Curtain has beentorn down  as have the walls of ideological intolerance.The foundations of apartheid have crumbled  and in theMiddle East a peace process is unfolding  filling us withhope  although it is not without problems. Majorsacrifices have been made by peoples under totalitarianregimes so as to win the right to live in peace andfreedom in a more secure world — a fairer  morepeaceful  tolerant and democratic one.However  we see that new crises and armed conflictshave arisen in other regions of the world. Because of itsinternational character  the United Nations is duty-boundto face up to the challenges of security required by thecurrent situation; our Organization’s global agenda allowsit to operate more dynamically. The United Nations mustconfront issues such as the eradication of poverty environmental degradation  terrorism  the use andtrafficking of drugs  violence suffered by women and thepromotion of democratic values and progress in socialdevelopment. Nicaragua is convinced that peace anddemocracy are closely related to development  and thatwithout economic development it is extremely difficult toachieve sustainable democracy.In the Secretary-General’s “An Agenda for Peace”we have a summary of the important changes that haveoccurred in recent years. He sets forth the difficultconditions of hunger and poverty among other things  stillexisting in developing countries. He also recognizes thatthe burden of debt and barriers to international trade arestill a danger to world stability. All this makes thedevelopment of the new concept of international securitymore difficult — as discussed right here in the UnitedNations. The Secretary-General’s “An Agenda for Peace”is a mechanism to help us bring about true comprehensive peace.Let us recall  as was stated today by the PrimeMinister of Norway  that peace is no longer onlysomething that States must seek from one another. Wemust seek peace within each State as well.20The sensitive mission of the United Nations at thisnew stage of its development can be illustrated by itsdynamic role in Central America  a region that in 1992 wasdeclared by this very General Assembly to be an area ofpeace  freedom  democracy and development.No one doubts that the United Nations has begun amajor process of profound transformation and renewal taking place precisely 50 years after its establishment andreflecting the current international situation. With thisrenewal we hope for greater democratization of our worldOrganization  particularly in the Security Council. We alsohope for the admission of new Members to theOrganization  such as the Republic of China on Taiwan which meets the requirements set forth in the Charter to bea Member State  but whose right to be a Member is stilldenied it. Likewise  we are expecting the United Nations tocontribute to developing countries  particularly throughprogrammes of technical cooperation and cooperation fordevelopment.During these last few years of transition  while wehave been establishing and consolidating peace anddemocracy in Nicaragua  world disarmament hasaccelerated. Budgets for armaments have been reduced inmany countries  and we  the Governments of CentralAmerica  have adopted some serious initiatives as regardsthe production  use and transfer of anti-personnel mines.We have also declared Central America to be a regioncompletely free of those devices.Areas that were once battlegrounds  includingNicaragua  are now seeing demining operations with goodprospects. At the same time  several nuclear-weapon Stateshave initiated moratoriums on testing  thus greatlydiminishing the possibility of a devastating nuclear war.We have also seen an increase in the number ofnuclear-weapon-free zones. The signing of the PelindabaTreaty establishes a zone of this kind in Africa; and withthe establishment of other nuclear-weapon-free zones inSouth-East Asia we will be strengthening the potential fora more secure world. It is important to recall that veryrecently we adopted by an overwhelming majority  righthere at United Nations Headquarters  the ComprehensiveNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.We are seriously concerned that much of the recentpolitical progress achieved throughout the world is notnecessarily in tune with progress in the economic sphere.Developing countries continue to face serious problemssuch as extreme poverty and unemployment. Access to newinternational markets continues to be limited for ourproducts. The burden of debt is unbearable  and theconstant inequalities in international financial systemscontinue to affect our countries adversely. Therefore  wemust urgently establish much fairer and more equitableinternational economic relations.We are also concerned that during this same periodof global  regional and national transition  new forms ofintolerance  lack of understanding and violation of humanrights have breached the peace in certain areas of theworld. Such is the case in Bosnia and Herzegovina Somalia and Rwanda  where events have profoundlydisturbed the human conscience.In this same regard  Nicaragua is troubled by recentevents in Burundi  where in spite of the efforts of theOrganization of African Unity (OAU) and theinternational community  the situation remains delicate.On the other hand  the efforts made towards reachingpeace in Chechnya hearten us.We are concerned at the continuation of practicesand their pernicious effects. We believe that theirperpetrators should be brought to justice withoutexception. We condemn attacks such as that uponPresident Mubarak of Egypt and the recent one inDharan  Saudi Arabia  in which hundreds of innocentpeople were wounded. We feel great solidarity with thevictims and their families.Nicaragua is concerned at the growth in theproduction  consumption and traffic in drugs  and in thegrowing relationship between terrorism and weaponstrafficking  which  like drug trafficking  continues to posea major threat to future generations.For these reasons  I would like to state thatNicaragua was pleased to hear the proposal made by thePresident of Colombia regarding the need to develop aglobal agenda for drugs. We believe that the UnitedNations should think hard about that important initiative.On the eve of the twenty-first century  theinternational community as a whole should seek out waysand means to overcome all of these situations. We shouldmake our best efforts in that regard. Nicaragua is ready tosupport the international community in these initiatives.In July 1994  the second International Conference ofNew and Restored Democracies was held in Managua Nicaragua; its main objective was to study in a frank and21objective manner the weaknesses  prospects and challengesof new democracies. On this occasion  on behalf of mycountry and in our capacity of interim secretariat of theConference  I would like to urge that the third conferenceof new democracies  which will be held next year inBucharest  Romania  receive the international community’sspecial attention.In this ongoing quest for peace and for thestrengthening of democracy  we in Central America areputting into practice a new model of regional security. Theoutstanding features of this new model have been embodiedin the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of CentralAmerica  which is a national and regional strategy to fostera change in personal and social attitudes to ensure theestablishment of a model of sustainable development in thepolitical  economic  social  cultural and environmentalfields.We Central Americans have already ratified aframework treaty for democratic security which deals withrespect for and the promotion and protection of humanrights. Its provisions ensure the security of the CentralAmerican States and their inhabitants through theestablishment of conditions which will allow them theirpersonal  family and social development in peace  freedomand democracy. These are initiatives which could be studiedin other regions with the aim of strengthening nationalprocesses within the context of new circumstances and withthe objective of moving towards a new international orderwhich will be more secure  to which we all aspire.Only months away from the end of President VioletaBarrios de Chamorro’s term of office and less than onemonth from the elections in which her successor will bechosen  we are very satisfied with the work carried outduring this period. World and regional events have had  andwill continue to have  their impact within countries. In thecase of Nicaragua  this impact has been highly positive. Bythe end of its term  our Government will have leftNicaragua completely different from the Nicaragua wefound in 1990.We are certain that whoever is elected President in thecoming elections will have the necessary vision to establish as it has done in the past  a Government of benefit to allNicaraguans. Thus  we believe that extensive democraticconsolidation should also continue in order to continue onthe path of peace  harmony and progress.On behalf of President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro I would like to ask the international community and theUnited Nations to continue supporting Nicaragua  for thegood of democracy  for the good of our country  and above all  for the good of the international community.I take this opportunity on behalf of the people andGovernment of Nicaragua and on my own behalf to thankthe States  the Governments  the internationalorganizations and non-governmental organizations which in one way or another  have lent our country theircooperation and solidarity. Without this solidarity weNicaraguans would never have been able to achieve thedemocracy we have today  nor would we have been ableto lay the foundation for economic development. To all ofthem and to all of you  members of the Assembly  thankyou very much."
"125",5197,"NLD",51,1996,"﻿I join my colleague Minister Dick Spring of Ireland  who spoke on behalf ofthe European Union  in congratulating you  Sir  on yourelection to the presidency of the General Assembly. As arepresentative with a long and distinguished career inUnited Nations affairs  you are especially qualified to guideour work in the coming year.As the present century draws to a close  we need toask ourselves what shape the United Nations is in. Is itready to face the world that lies ahead? Is it ready to meetthe needs of generations that are still to be born? Therealities confronting us today may still be the realities oftomorrow  and they are formidable. We are witnessingincreasing poverty  a growing rift between rich and poor migration  population pressure  dwindling food stocks hazards to public health and the environment  drugs terrorism  internal conflicts and wholesale violations ofhuman rights: a daunting litany.In the face of these realities  to argue in favour ofreform of this Organization would be stating the obvious.Of course we need reform. Clearly  the United Nations over the years  has turned into an institutional junglewhere outsiders do not venture  an organization which forthat reason alone has lost much of its credibility andwhich is badly in need of revitalization. We have toreform. There is no alternative.We need reforms to get back what we have lost; thatis  not power  but authority. Power is wielded on manydifferent levels  and by some States more than by others.There is not very much the United Nations can do toinfluence Member States to make use of their power  andthe power of the United Nations itself is rather limited.But what the United Nations was given a lot of 51 yearsago  was authority: moral authority as well as legalauthority  the kind of authority that comes with speakingon behalf of the world community  with voicing thepublic conscience and transcending vested interests.Indeed  if this Organization is to approach the future froma position of strength and of confidence  and if we expectthe nations of the world to rally behind the flag of theUnited Nations  its authority needs to be intact. In fact  itneeds to be growing.Well  is it growing? Here a sobering note is due. Atthis critical juncture in its history  the United Nations isseeing its authority  the one commodity it can never havetoo much of  compromised and weakened; this is also theone commodity it cannot afford to have too little of. Iwould wish to highlight some of the manifestations ofhow the authority of the United Nations is on the waneand offer some prospects for shoring it up again.First  multilateralism  as such  is under pressure.Many States no longer regard multilateral cooperation asa separate goal of their foreign policy  but instead as oneof many policy instruments which they can choose toapply or not to apply in accordance with their nationalinterests. Alterative sources of international leadershiphave sprung up  and ad hoc coalitions are formed as theneed arises. The United Nations is regarded more andmore as a vehicle for safeguarding a nation’s particularinterests  even in the short term  rather than as thepreferred avenue for solving pressing world-wideproblems. This shopping-mall attitude towards the UnitedNations is in stark contrast with the lofty principles thefounding fathers signed their names to.16Gradual loss of authority is also caused bydisappointment and frustration. The United Nations wasonce established as an ideal form of internationalcooperation. Particularly after the end of the cold war expectations rose as never before. For decades  the worldhad been dominated and the United Nations paralysed bytwo power blocs at loggerheads. The United Nations couldnow finally begin to play the role originally laid out for it.Unfortunately  this did not happen. Success storiessuch as the United Nations involvement in Namibia  in ElSalvador and Mozambique were overshadowed bydisappointment over the outcome of Missions Impossiblesuch as Somalia  Rwanda and Bosnia. That the MemberStates themselves had decided to send the United Nationson those missions could not stem the erosion of authoritythat came with them.Frustration has mounted over effectiveness andefficiency  two qualities that have eluded the UnitedNations for a long time. It would be facile to blame thelack of them on the Secretariat alone. The grinding mannerin which the intergovernmental machinery of thisOrganization works is a major factor as well.Criticism abounds. The track record of the UnitedNations is in many ways impressive  to be sure  and evenmore so when we look at the broad spectrum of the entireUnited Nations system. Its achievements in the fields ofinternational law  human rights  development  thepopulation crisis  health care  the position of women  labourconditions and disarmament are just random examples. Inreality  the list is long. Yet somehow United Nations-bashing has become the craze these days and even a tool ofcampaign rhetoric  or else it serves to distract attentionfrom internal problems. Nevertheless  the United Nationsmoral authority is sapped by the real and the imagined andby criticism justified or unjustified.Then there is the financial situation. From the earlydays  payment or non-payment of contributions has beenindicative of the United Nations approval rating. The levelof arrears we are now facing is  however  withoutprecedent. Sadly  it is in large part a reflection of decliningconfidence and belief in the Organization’s potential. Thepresent financial turmoil is not primarily the cause of theUnited Nations predicament  but rather a consequence of it a symptom. Of course  empty coffers will lead to lessoutput eventually. Less output would undermine authorityeven further. Less authority in turn leads to fewerpayments  which again would exacerbate the financialcrisis. And so we may see the United Nations caught in adownward spiral. The current payment habits of someMember States amount to a self-fulfilling prophecy.Worse  they betray the very principles on which theUnited Nations was founded. The absence of full  promptand unconditional payments will further erode the UnitedNations authority  the same authority those very Stateshelped to bestow on the Organization 50 years ago.If there is one policy area in which the UnitedNations has lost much of its authority and stands to looseeven more  it is peace and security. Take Burundi. Today the humanitarian and political situation there is alarming.We are witnessing a creeping genocide. Terror prevails.In the past few months alone  thousands of innocent men women and children have lost their lives. An explosion ofgenocide is still a real threat. We cannot allow theoccurrence of another disaster such as that which tookplace in Rwanda in 1994. In that year  we claimed thatwe could hardly have seen it coming. In the case ofBurundi  there will be no such excuse. The writing isclearly on the wall. If we fail once again and a secondgenocide does take place  the United Nations will sufferits most dramatic loss of authority ever.What can we do to enhance the effectiveness of theUnited Nations and hence to help it regain the authorityit needs in order to fulfil its mandate? How can wereverse the downward spiral?If the United Nations is to be effective  the variousinstruments at the disposal of the international communityhave to be used in an integrated manner. This holds trueparticularly in the area of peace and security. In this area political  military  socio-economic  electoral andhumanitarian assistance  as well as reconstruction anddevelopment  will have to be applied in harmony. Hence an integrated approach is the only way effectively toprevent and combat conflicts. The United Nations needsto be on the ground when it matters and where it matters.This is the lesson that can be drawn from recent crises inAfrica — such as in Rwanda and Somalia — where theinternational response to tragic violence becameineffective through lack of coherence.Preventive diplomacy  on the one hand  and post-conflict peace-building  on the other  require increasedattention. More than ever  the United Nations shouldfocus on the prevention of conflicts and  when conflictsdo occur nevertheless  on defusing them at an early stage.When I addressed this Assembly two years ago  Idrew attention to the United Nations capability  or rather17the lack of it  to respond adequately and in a timely mannerto acute situations of conflict. Some progress has beenmade since then — progress in the form of modestintermediate steps that would in the longer run lead to aUnited Nations better equipped to maintain peace andsecurity. Today  there is a growing number of countries thattake part in the United Nations standby-arrangementssystem and in the efforts of a group of nations to establisha United Nations high-readiness brigade under this system.The transparency of the Security Council’s decision-makingconcerning peace-operations has improved. A rapidlydeployable headquarters will soon be added to the UnitedNations peace-keeping capacity.The future of conflict prevention is linked to theUnited Nations power to combat yet another threat to itsauthority: impunity. Does the world community actuallyhave sufficient means to bring to justice those guilty of warcrimes or crimes against humanity? As the cases of Burundiand Liberia sadly illustrate  the prospect of impunityprovides an open invitation to commit crimes without fearof retribution and stands in the way of future reconciliationand reconstruction. The Tribunals on the former Yugoslaviaand on Rwanda represent the single most importantendeavour of the international community since Nurembergto adjudicate war crimes and crimes against humanity. Wecannot let it fail. Yet the Yugoslavia Tribunal will face aserious problem so long as it cannot gain custody of moreof the many people it has indicted. Soon  the presentcircumstances will erode its authority and  indeed  that ofthe United Nations as a whole.My country feels that the establishment of ad hocTribunals once again underlines the need for the speedycreation of a permanent international criminal court. Oncethis Court has been established  it will become even moreimperative that those accused of such crimes actually bebrought to trial. The United Nations should enhance itscapacity to ensure the apprehension  extradition and trial ofthose so accused.If there is one area of the United Nations where moraland legal authority play crucial roles  it is that of humanrights. Here  the record of the Organization is impressive but still more can and should be done and new challengeslie in store.Increased attention for human rights will increase themoral authority of the United Nations. In this regard  itsauthority should rest firmly on the Universal Declaration adopted by this Organization in 1948“as a common standard of achievement for allpeoples and all nations” (resolution 217 A (III) eighth preambular para.) —in other words  a universal framework. Forty-five yearslater  in Vienna  the universality of human rights wasonce again expounded by the United Nations membershipas we know it today.Yet  universality of human rights is under pressure.Ever since Vienna  the discussion of what is calledcultural particularities seems to have chipped away at it.Some Governments claim that their nation’s human-rightsperformance cannot be held up to the same standards asother nations’ due to differences in their historical cultural and religious backgrounds.Let us make no mistake. There are differences in theway people look at human rights in the various regions ofthe world and the ongoing dialogue in the United Nationswould be ill-served if we chose to deny that there wereany differences at all. True  religious and ethical values cultural backgrounds and philosophical convictions shouldbe borne in mind at all times and  by themselves  areeven protected by the Universal Declaration. But theirlink to human rights as such and to the concept ofuniversality is a very particular one. The internationalcommunity has expressed it nowhere more accurately thanin the Platform for Action adopted in Beijing one yearago. As we agreed in Beijing  rather than detracting fromthe ambit of universality  cultural differences shouldcontribute to the full enjoyment of human rights. TheStates Members of this Organization agreed in Viennathat  regardless of their political  economic and culturalsystems  it is their duty to promote and protect all humanrights and fundamental freedoms.Increased emphasis calls for more financialresources. A larger part of the United Nations budgetshould be devoted to human rights. This  in turn  willenhance the moral authority of the Organization in theeyes of the multitudes who are still deprived of theirhuman rights today. Letting the programme wither awaywill produce the opposite effect.The General Assembly  being the only plenary organof the United Nations  is the most conspicuous.Credibility and authority are very much tied to theAssembly’s performance. Sadly  this body sees many of18its resolutions ignored. We should vigorously seek to infusenew vitality into the Assembly’s proceedings and in therelevance of its achievements.Two weeks ago  the Assembly effectively lived up toits responsibility by adopting the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty by an overwhelming majority. Theadoption of the Treaty by this world body lends authorityto the new norm outlawing nuclear testing. My countryfeels privileged that it was called upon to preside over thenegotiations. Adoption of the Treaty contributes to theultimate elimination of all nuclear weapons  a goal to whichmy country remains fully committed. We aim for apropitious entry into force. But even in the absence of entryinto force  the authority of the United Nations will make itmore difficult for any State to act against the Treaty.Increased attention should be given to those activitiesof the United Nations which are not of a strictly politicalnature or concerned with security  namely  the socio-economic aspects and the strengthening of those parts ofthe United Nations system dealing with such matters aspoverty  population  food security  urbanization  equality ofwomen and the environment. These areas are crucial for thefuture of the world and for the quality of life on this planet.These are also areas where the Organization is especiallyqualified to identify and debate the problems and where ithas set up an impressive array of operational activities. Aseries of world conferences in recent years has helped toupgrade the authority of the United Nations system. Theyhave set an agenda for the United Nations and the MemberStates to follow during the coming decades. The WorldFood Summit in November should do the same. TheSummit faces the awesome problem of a world that mayhave to feed 10 billion people by the time the UnitedNations is 100 years old.There is  of course  a risk that expectations have beenraised too high once more and that disappointment will leadonce more to loss of authority. The United Nations and itsMember States have to make sure this does not happen.The United Nations will play a major role in the fields ofadvocacy  coordination and monitoring. Although theUnited Nations itself contributes to implementation throughits field operations  the Member States bear the primaryresponsibility for full implementation at the national level.Together  they can succeed in ensuring that the worldcommunity reaches the goals it has set for itself.The authority of the United Nations is at stake. It willnot disappear in a clap of thunder. It will die with awhimper. It stands to fade away gradually  without at anytime making alarm bells ring  and with it  theOrganization may well slide into the margins of the worldscene. The United Nations needs a new sense of directionand purpose to become  once again  a beacon for mankindas intended by the authors of the Charter. That requires asustained effort of all Members of this Organization.There is little time left. Let us use it well."
"126",5242,"NOR",51,1996,"﻿Tomorrow  I am goingto sign the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty onbehalf of Norway. We join with almost all countries incelebrating our new freedom — freedom from fear ofnuclear contamination and proliferation. By our jointresolve  the terror of competitive madness fell victim tothe sheer force of reason.Thanks to the United Nations  the norm ofnon-testing has been galvanized. It is today part andparcel of international law. In the future  no country whether it has signed that treaty or not  will be able tobreak that norm. That can no longer be done withimpunity. It will go down in the annals of history thatnuclear testing was carried out over a period of 40 yearsin the twentieth century  and then never again.The decades of negotiations seemed endless  andwithout the perseverance of this Organization  it wouldnot have worked. Where else could we carve out a globaltest ban? Where else can we cast norms of globalapplicability? Where else can we extend an internationalsociety based on law and contract?That is what the United Nations does best. It is easyto ridicule years of meticulous negotiations. It is easy toderide the process as bloated bureaucracy andinefficiency. It is easy because that also happens everyday  here by the East River. And we must never becomeused to that.But some processes take time because they aredifficult and because they have profound effects on thewhole world. Every country  every man  woman and childdepend on what we can achieve right here  and everycountry represented here has a stake in our success or ourfailure.8For more than 50 years  the United Nations has — forbetter  but also for worse — reflected its Members  globalpolitical trends  contrasts  conflicts and confrontations. Ithas been judged  unjustly  more by its failures than by itssuccesses.The integration of scores of new Member States peace-keeping operations  the promotion and protection ofhuman rights  and field activities in developing countriesbringing relief and consolation to millions of destitutepeople all bear witness to how the United Nations hasharnessed the best of humanity and civilization. Today  thethreats to peace come not so much from contention betweengreat States. Today’s killing fields are within States. Out ofaround 40 cases of armed conflict in the world today hardly any occur between States. These conflicts are deeplyembedded in the history of regions and peoples  wheredisruption within societies date far back  some beingcenturies old.The price of intra-State conflict is being paid bycivilians. Ninety per cent of casualties in armed conflict arecivilians. They literally walk the minefields where millionsof anti-personnel mines are strewn. Not only is thedeath-toll numbing; let us also count the many missed yearsof economic production  the livestock lost  the schoolsravaged  the clinics destroyed.Millions pay the terrible human price. But we all paya price if the gap deepens between the fundamental normsof civilization and the daily suffering in too many countriesin too many parts of the world. Reversing that trend is ourmoral obligation; preventing deadly conflict is our commonchallenge.True  the United Nations is increasingly involved ininternal crises. We still do not possess the necessary means mandates and mission capacity to suppress devastatingconflict. All too often  intervention comes when the conflicthas erupted  when the battles have been fought and thedividing lines have been cemented. When the peacemakersare ready to go  it may be late — often too late.We lack efficient procedures for dealing withemerging conflicts. To individual countries  emergingintra-State conflict may not be deemed vital. But to theUnited Nations  any armed conflict or threat of conflictmust be vital. We need more preventive action and morepreventive diplomacy. Here at the United Nations  we needto develop the institutional  legal and managerial capacityto act  which would provide a model for regional action.Preventing conflict and human suffering must not behampered by the traditional norm of what is essentiallywithin the domestic jurisdiction of States. Killing peoplecannot be protected by the Charter.A situation which is not visibly dangerous and whichdoes not offer spectacular pictures for the evening news is all too often silenced and out of the news picture. Andsince those who suffer have no vote in any of thecountries which command the resources to help  it may beall too convenient to look the other way.But reacting in time need not be costly. On thecontrary  there is so much to gain  there is so much tosave. Much could be achieved if the United Nations werebetter able to send experienced diplomats and supportmissions to conflict-ridden areas in timely endeavours todeescalate conflict and reconstruct civil society. We knowthat the hands of the Secretary-General are often tied insuch cases  when it comes to redirecting resources. Thatis another challenge. United Nations expertise — ourexpertise — may not show up in a situation because thereare insufficient funds to pay for air tickets.Norway is ready to make an extra contribution. Weoffer to establish a fund for preventive action here at theUnited Nations. We pledge to fill it with approximately 1million dollars on an annual basis  and we invite otherGovernments to join us. The fund would facilitateimmediate deployment of first-class expertise forproactive diplomacy.Any organization that fails to change is bound tolose its effectiveness. So we must press on with reform.But we cannot accept intimidation. Withholding legallyassessed contributions amounts to just that. Today  somecountries in fact pay more than their fair share. Othercountries voluntarily pay more than their fair share. Manycountries pay too little  or hardly anything at all. We nowneed to settle on a long-term solution based on a moreequitable scale of contributions and scrupulous respect byMember States for their financial obligations and thepayment of arrears.We must press on with reform of the SecurityCouncil. We are not served by protracted denials of theworld as it is. The Security Council must reflect thisworld  and the issue of a regionally-balanced enlargementmust now be addressed. Asia  Africa and Latin Americashould be represented on a permanent basis. Japan andGermany should each have a permanent seat. And as weenlarge the Council we must see to it that the efficiency9of decision-making is retained and that the Council’simplementing ability is greatly enhanced.If we had sat down at the drawing board to create theUnited Nations today  we would have grouped the mostclosely interlinked challenges together and designated alimited number of agencies to deal with them. Today  in thesocial and economic field  responsibility for sustainabledevelopment  poverty  population and education is divided.There is too much fragmentation and too many turf battles.We need a leaner — and thereby  I believe  stronger— structure to deal with what we decided in Rio Cairo Copenhagen and Beijing. Now we must do what wesaid there.The Nordic countries  in their ongoing project forUnited Nations reform  have focused on the other end ofthe spectrum — the country level. Today  there are severalUnited Nations representatives in one country  oftenoverlapping each other and often contributing to morefragmentation. But political issues  humanitarian issues andlong-term development are interlinked. Our organizationalset-up should be the same. Let us coordinate ourhumanitarian assistance activities better  thus allowing us toreact more quickly and more effectively. And let us speakout more openly about human rights.Human rights are violated all over the world. But onlyin a few countries is the human rights situationdeteriorating. We may be impatient; we may find thatprogress is too slow in important countries; and there maybe temporary set-backs.But in a world of global communication  facts can nolonger be hidden. We cannot build fences around ideas inthe age of the Internet. It will become increasinglyimpossible to derive the benefits of the global economywithout exposing political power structures to the scrutinyof democracy.The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treatyestablished a global norm. This is what the United Nationsdoes best and what it must continue to do. The first Chapterof the Charter calls for effective collective measures for theremoval of threats to the peace. Our challenge is to graspthe complexity of today’s threats. No single country ispowerful enough to deal alone with the threats thattranscend our frontiers — terrorism  nuclear proliferation drugs  crime  disease and damage to the environment. Theyall require common action. They all belong on our commonagenda.Five years ago in Rio we reached consensus onAgenda 21. That was a call for action. Together wesowed the first seeds of a global norm for sustainabledevelopment. Now we must struggle on towards itsimplementation.Later this year we will start the final work on aclimate protocol. No challenge is more global thanclimate change. We owe it to present and futuregenerations to come up with a binding agreement that iscost-effective  equitable and verifiable. That process willrequire a combined political and scientific craftsmanshipwhich will need to draw upon every experience we havehad in multilateral diplomacy so far.There can be no civilized world unless we unite tostrengthen multilateralism by establishing globalnorms  by building and raising the minimum standards ofinter- and intra-State behaviour  and by building newnorms of international accountability.The war crimes tribunal in The Hague is abuilding-block in that edifice. The preventive aspectwould be served if the Karadzic´s and Mladic´s of thisworld were brought to justice to answer for their crimes.But again  conflicts should not be allowed to go thatfar. We must be able to address the root causes ofconflict in time. That is what prevention is all about. Thatis the win-win game we should all be playing. We cannotafford not to do so."
"127",5288,"NPL",51,1996,"﻿On behalf of my delegation andon my own behalf  I should like at the outset tocongratulate Mr. Razali Ismail on his unanimous election tothe presidency of the fifty-first session of the GeneralAssembly  and to express my happiness at seeing a fellowAsian  from Malaysia  with which my country enjoys thebest of relations  guiding our deliberations. I pledge to himthe full cooperation of my delegation. I wish also to thankMr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral for having guided the fiftiethsession of the General Assembly to a successful conclusion.My profound appreciation and gratitude also go tothe Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for histireless efforts in quest of a world of peace  progress justice and humanity.The past five decades have seen the United Nationsstriving to fulfil its Charter objectives. Yet peace andprosperity — mankind’s highest dream — remainunrealized. Conflicts  enormous cruelty  poverty  hungerand  of late  population and environmental problems  havebeen relentlessly on the rise. The United Nations  whichhas limited resources at its disposal and is thus ill-prepared to deal with such situations  has become thetarget of increasing public criticism. The tendency tofocus on the Organization’s set-backs while ignoring itsrecord of real and substantive success threatens toundermine the raison d’être of the United Nations.Those formidable odds notwithstanding  the worldbody has achieved a great deal of success in the field ofpeace  democracy and human rights. It has many recentachievements to its credit  in Namibia  Mozambique Cambodia  Haiti and El Salvador  to name but a few.Thanks to the efforts of the United Nations  the hope forstability and democracy has been a living reality in thosecountries.The presence of the United Nations Interim Force inLebanon  the United Nations Disengagement ObserverForce and the United Nations Truce SupervisionOrganization continues to make a difference in the MiddleEast. Similarly  the United Nations has exerted efforts tokeep and mediate peace in many countries of Asia Africa  Europe and Latin America through use of its goodoffices and through peacekeeping operations. In spite ofperceived setbacks suffered by the Organization in somepeacekeeping operations  which were undermanned andlacked clear-cut mandates  we must not forget the realgood that has been achieved through the prevention offurther genocides  the provision of massive humanitarianrelief and paving the way for political settlements.A year ago  many world leaders gathered here tocommemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the UnitedNations. With a deep sense of optimism  they took stockof the past and present performance of the Organization as they also pondered the future course that it may haveto traverse. They reaffirmed their faith in the principlesand purposes of the United Nations Charter  renewed theircommitment to the world body and pledged their supportto enable the Organization to come to grips with newrealities and challenges. No doubt the fiftieth anniversary14underlined the need to reactivate the United Nations as thecentrepiece of international relations  thereby furtherdeepening our hopes in the world body.Nepal takes comfort in the fact that the Dayton peaceprocess has provided the people of Bosnia and Herzegovinawith a chance to realize their long-cherished dream of apeaceful homeland. The recently concluded elections  wehope  will contribute to a lasting peace in the Balkans  andwe take this opportunity to extend our appreciation to allwho contributed to this election process. We are equallyhappy to be part of this peace process through ourcontribution of civilian police monitors to the InternationalPolice Task Force and the United Nations TransitionalAdministration for Eastern Slavonia  Baranja and WesternSirmium  under the United Nations Mission in Bosnia andHerzegovina. We hope that the next local elections will alsobe held peacefully.Last year in this Hall I said that the peace process inthe Middle East had become irreversible. That is still theview of Nepal  but the recent aggravation of the situation involving heavy loss of lives and consequent negativeimplications for peace  has given us deep concern. It is myearnest hope that the recent Washington summit meetingbetween Prime Minister Netanyahu and Chairman Arafatwill restore trust between the two sides and be instrumentalin the immediate resumption of serious negotiations withinthe Middle East peace process.More than any other country  the landlocked countryof Afghanistan has been a victim of the cold war  and theAfghan people are still suffering from its far-reachingconsequences. We hope that peace prevails in that country.Nepal  however  was deeply concerned at the flagrantviolation of the United Nations sanctuary.We believe that United Nations peacekeepingoperations are indispensable in the maintenance ofinternational peace and security. Nepal has been a majortroop-contributing country to peacekeeping missions of theUnited Nations. Over the years we have participated invarious peacekeeping operations with a total of 30 000troops and hundreds of civilian police. Our commitment toUnited Nations peace initiatives continues undiminished.Nepal supports ongoing efforts for the establishmentof a rapidly deployable Headquarters team in theDepartment of Peacekeeping Operations of the UnitedNations Secretariat  within the framework of a system ofstand-by arrangements to enhance the rapid responsecapabilities of the United Nations — a system to whichNepal has made a stand-by commitment to provide up to2 000 troops and 200 police monitors. Work on such aHeadquarters team should proceed in a transparentmanner and involve all interested Member States particularly troop-contributing nations. We believe that itshould be composed of staff recruited by the UnitedNations.The United Nations is unfortunately beset with achronic financial crisis  which has seriously impaired theOrganization’s ability to perform well. Despite the year-long meetings of the High-level Open-ended WorkingGroup on the Financial Situation of the United Nations the financial health of the Organization is still precarious and cross-funding of the regular budget from thepeacekeeping account is becoming almost the rule ratherthan the exception. The continuation of such practice which invariably results in late reimbursements to thetroop-contributing countries  is detrimental to the rapiddeployment capability expected of the United Nations.The capacity of the United Nations to plan and executepeacekeeping missions will be greatly undermined if thepresent financial crisis persists. Without a secure financialbase  the international community cannot expect theUnited Nations to play the role demanded of it in themaintenance of international peace and security.Modern peacekeeping missions  involving complexintra-State conflicts combined with massive humanitarianrelief operations  expose peacekeepers to anunprecedented level of danger. It is therefore only fittingthat those brave harbingers of peace who are put inharm’s way be treated on an equal footing by the UnitedNations. We hope that a just system of death anddisability compensation  as mandated by the fiftiethsession of the General Assembly  will be establishedsoon.For Nepal  the recent adoption by the GeneralAssembly of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treatyis a landmark in the history of nuclear non-proliferationand arms control. We hope that it is the culmination ofour efforts to ban nuclear testing once and for all. Webelieve that the conclusion of the ComprehensiveNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty brings us a step closer to ourdream of a nuclear-weapon-free world. It is precisely forthat reason that Nepal supported the Treaty  to which Iput my signature yesterday on behalf of my country.The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty is onlya partial fulfilment of our Treaty commitment to pursuein good faith the goal of the total elimination of nuclear15weapons. With the adoption of the Treaty  it has becomemore urgent than ever that we seriously consider otherpriority issues of nuclear disarmament in a practicable time-bound framework. In this regard  Nepal wishes tounderline its support for the programme of action recentlyput forward by 28 non-aligned and neutral countries for theelimination of nuclear weapons through a phasedprogramme.In recent times  substantial progress has been made inthe creation and expansion of nuclear-weapon-free zones.The Treaty of Bangkok and the Treaty of Pelindaba haveestablished South-East Asia and the continent of Africa respectively  as nuclear-weapon-free zones. Indeed  theseare steps  in the best tradition of the Treaties of Tlatelolcoand Rarotonga  that could contribute greatly to the cause ofnuclear disarmament and the global nuclear non-proliferation regime. We earnestly hope that efforts will beintensified in the Middle East and in our own region ofSouth Asia so that the goal of nuclear-weapon-free zonesbecomes a reality in those regions as well.We are of the view that our efforts towards the goalof total nuclear disarmament must be matched by efforts toachieve the non-proliferation of other weapons of massdestruction. We therefore fully support measures aimed atimposing a total ban on chemical  biological and otherinhumane weapons  including the production  sale andexport of anti-personnel landmines. In this regard  I amglad to say that Nepal is now at the final stage ofcompleting the necessary constitutional process in order toratify the chemical weapons Convention  which we havealready signed.As host to the United Nations Regional Centre forPeace and Disarmament in Asia and the Pacific  mydelegation wishes to emphasize the need for institutionalarrangements for the strengthening of the WorldDisarmament Campaign. The Kathmandu Centre hascontributed to international  regional and subregionaldialogue aimed at transparency and confidence-building inthe areas of disarmament and security.In his annual report on the work of the UnitedNations  the Secretary-General notes that the past yearwitnessed a determined effort by the internationalcommunity to take action to end the scourge of terrorism.I would like to reaffirm the commitment of Nepal to theDeclaration on Measures to Eliminate InternationalTerrorism adopted by the General Assembly two years ago.The reform of the Security Council is considerednecessary to make that crucial organ of the UnitedNations more reflective of contemporary realities. Weagree that any expansion of the Security Council mustaccommodate the interests and concerns of the bulk of thetotal membership  to redress the existing imbalance andanomalous representation. Any agreed formula forexpansion  in our view  must take into account the issueof equitable global representativity. The selection of themembers of an expanded Security Council should beguided by the contribution of Member States to themaintenance of international peace and security.Having said that  I want to emphasize that since theSecurity Council is the principal instrument of theinternational community in the area of collective security no expansion or reform should diminish in any way itscapacity for prompt and effective action to maintaininternational peace and security.The establishment of the World Trade Organization(WTO) following the conclusion of the Uruguay Roundhas made it clear that no country can ignore theglobalization process  which is gaining tremendousmomentum. At the same time  the acceleration of thisprocess of global economic integration has failed tonarrow the gap between the developed and the developingcountries. The economic situation of many countries ofAfrica and the least developed countries is furtherdeteriorating  and those countries are being marginalizedbecause of unfavourable conditions prevailing in theglobal market in the trade of their exportable products.Furthermore  those countries lack national capacity interms of technology and product development capabilityand also face various tariff and non-tariff barriers to theirexports abroad.The situation of the landlocked developing countriesamong the least developed countries is further exacerbatedby the high costs associated with the production andtransportation of their exportable commodities and theirdifficulty in maintaining the tight delivery schedulesdemanded by the global market. Without direct access tothe sea and given the absence of a significant market basewithin their boundaries  those landlocked countries cannotoffer any of the comparative advantages so essential toattracting foreign investment. Additional financialresources and the transfer of appropriate technology accompanied by concrete measures to offset those built-inhandicaps  are the bare minimum requirements. Weexpect that the WTO ministerial meeting at Singaporewill take this reality into account and ensure that the16products of the least developed countries are given free andunrestricted access to world markets in order to facilitatethe integration of those countries into the liberalizing andglobalizing world economy.It is with great distress that the developing countries and in particular the least developed countries  witness thesteep decline in the resources of United Nations operationalactivities for development. The least developed countriesneed the enhanced support of those agencies more thanever  since most of them have embarked on far-reachingreforms. In the absence of the flows of direct foreigninvestment now available to many developing countries  theleast developed countries that lack basic physicalinfrastructure and material resources have nowhere else toturn. The efforts of the organs of the United Nations systemengaged in providing technical and advisory assistance tothe least developed countries  particularly the UnitedNations Conference on Trade and Development(UNCTAD)  need to be supplemented adequately by theBretton Woods institutions and regional financialinstitutions to arrest and reverse the declining economic andsocial situation of the least developed countries.The solidarity of the support received from therepresentatives of the Non-Aligned Movement and theGroup of 77 during the recently concluded ministerialmeeting of least developed countries is an expression ofunderstanding and an acknowledgment of the responsibilityof the international community to the least developedcountries. We are confident that the emphasis given by theleaders of the Group of Seven at the Lyon Summit on theneed to assist the least developed countries and to integratethem in the global economy will be backed by concreteactions.South-South cooperation is another importantcomponent of international economic cooperation thatshould be further explored and promoted. The Governmentof Costa Rica deserves our appreciation for its generousoffer to host a South-South conference on finance  tradeand investment in January next year.In recent years we have witnessed a decline in theeconomic conditions of more and more people  especiallythose from the developing countries  who now comprise apopulation of 1.3 billion people living in poverty. TheDeclaration of the year 1996 as the International Year forthe Eradication of Poverty and the Declaration of the firstUnited Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty beginning in 1997  must be taken seriously if poverty is tobe eradicated with renewed vigour and dedication. Theeradication of poverty must be a priority agenda for allmultilateral development institutions.In this regard  we express our appreciation to theSecretary-General for his initiative to establish  throughthe Administrative Committee on Coordination  inter-agency task forces to oversee coherent implementation bythe United Nations system of various cross-sectoral issuescovered in recent major international conferences. It isheartening to note that one of the task forces  which is onthe creation of an enabling environment  is chaired by theWorld Bank. We look forward to the reports of the taskforces  which are expected in April 1997.We are confident that the special session of theGeneral Assembly on the Rio Declaration to be held inJune of next year will be successful in achieving theobjective of acquiring new and additional resources toimplement Agenda 21. We urge the developed countriesto honour the commitments they have made at majorinternational conferences  including those at Rio  Cairo Copenhagen  Beijing and Istanbul. We are deeplyconcerned at the declining level of official developmentassistance to developing countries  in particular the leastdeveloped countries.We are happy to see that the Framework Conventionon Climate Change has entered into force and is beingimplemented effectively. We are at the same timeconcerned about the Convention on Biological Diversity which has not been ratified by many countries. I amespecially pleased to say that the Parliament of Nepal hasalready ratified the International Convention to CombatDesertification.We are firmly committed to the Charter obligationto promote and protect fundamental human rights for all without distinction as to race  sex  language or religion.My delegation is closely following the negotiations thatare taking place in the Third Committee working groupestablished to oversee the recommendations of the ViennaDeclaration and Programme of Action.The Fourth World Conference on Women was alandmark in reaffirming the equal rights of women  andfocused our attention on the important aspect of the equalparticipation of men and women in developmentactivities. We in Nepal are serious about implementingthe outcome of that Conference  with the creation initially  of a separate Ministry of Women and SocialWelfare.17Political strife  ethnic conflicts and the denial of basichuman rights in many parts of the world have resulted in aninflux of a large number of refugees  mostly women andchildren. We express our appreciation to the HighCommissioner for Refugees for her untiring and continuedefforts to take care of refugees around the world  despitethe limited resources at her disposal. The Office of theUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)deserves our special praise for providingnecessary food and other services to some 100 000refugees in the camps in eastern Nepal. His Majesty’sGovernment of Nepal upholds the right of every refugeeto return to his or her homeland safely and with dignity.The Government will make every effort to solve theproblem of refugees from Bhutan through mutualdiscussion and understanding.As a critical part of our broad policy of peace cooperation and friendship with all countries of the worldon the basis of the Charter of the United Nations and theprinciple of non-alignment  Nepal is pursuing a policy ofpromoting regional cooperation and understanding underthe umbrella of the South Asian Association for RegionalCooperation (SAARC). We celebrated the tenthanniversary of the Association last year. The sevencountries of the Association are engaged in various areasof cooperation  including the suppression of terrorism anddrug abuse  environmental preservation  povertyalleviation and the promotion of regional trade. It is a factthat SAARC is far behind other similar regionalcooperation arrangements  but the countries of theAssociation  particularly Nepal  are persevering in theirdetermination to develop both the habit and concretemeasures of cooperation  understanding and peace amongthe South Asian partners."
"128",5352,"NZL",51,1996,"﻿It gives me particularpleasure to address the General Assembly at a session ofover which Malaysia has been elected to preside. Our twocountries are good friends  and Ambassador Razali ispersonally known to and respected by us all. New Zealandlooks forward to a productive session under his leadership.In just two weeks New Zealanders face a generalelection. There are many subjects over which the variouspolitical parties differ  but one thing remains quite clear: thesupport of New Zealanders for the United Nations and therule of international law embodied in it.For New Zealand  as for many other countriesrepresented here today — and especially smallercountries — the primary purpose of the United Nationsremains to provide for a system of collective security. Itbrings the nations of the world together in a grand coalitionto keep the peace  to help eliminate weapons of massdestruction  to uphold human rights  to encourage goodgovernance  to protect the environment and to promoteeconomic and social development  including bysupporting the role of women.Together  these activities  along with national andregional initiatives  provide the underpinnings of thesystem of collective security that we want to leave for ourchildren.For New Zealanders  our confidence in the UnitedNations was reaffirmed when  two weeks ago  the GeneralAssembly adopted the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-BanTreaty. It gave me much satisfaction to sign the Treatyearlier today on behalf of the Government and the peopleof New Zealand. Agreement on a test ban has been aNew Zealand objective for more than three decades andone we promoted in this Assembly  together withAustralia and Mexico. It reflects deeply held convictionson the part of all New Zealanders.New Zealand has argued  and will continue to argue for a world without nuclear weapons. Our belief thatthese weapons of mass destruction can and should beeliminated has been reinforced by the experiences of ourregion as a testing ground for nuclear weapons. I am gladto say it is an era now happily behind us.For New Zealand  the Treaty represents first of allan end to nuclear testing in our region and worldwide.But even more  it puts real obstacles in the way of anyState seeking to refine or develop a nuclear arsenal. Wehave taken a significant step on the way to eliminatingnuclear weapons entirely. Now  however  we must lookahead.The International Court of Justice  in its recentAdvisory Opinion on the legality of the use or threat of useof nuclear weapons  set out our obligation in this regard:the obligation to pursue in good faith and to bring to aconclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament.New Zealand believes that in 1997 all States  includingnuclear-weapon States  should pursue negotiations on aphased programme of nuclear disarmament  with theultimate goals of the complete elimination of nuclearweapons and a treaty on general and complete disarmamentunder strict and effective international control.We are better placed to make our contribution to suchnegotiations because of the recent decision of theConference on Disarmament to admit New Zealand and 22other countries as full members. As a reflection of theimportance we attach to its ongoing work  my Governmenthas now decided to appoint a full-time DisarmamentAmbassador to the Conference in Geneva.Further steps towards a nuclear-free world arerecommended in the report of the Canberra Commission onthe Elimination of Nuclear Weapons  released last month.We hope that report will energize discussions at thenational level  particularly in the nuclear-weapon States.The aspirations of many States to be free of nuclearweapons have found expression in the establishment ofwhat are now four nuclear-weapon-free zones. Takentogether  the four relevant treaties have the potential tocover some 114 nations and 1.7 billion people. MyGovernment has given considerable thought to ways inwhich cooperation between nuclear-weapon-free zones canbe advanced. We are working with other Governments ona draft resolution to be submitted to the Assembly at thissession  and New Zealand hopes it will receive widesupport.The disarmament arena is only one where the UnitedNations must continue to address serious challenges to ourcollective security. When my Government took office inOctober 1990  the international community faced thechallenge presented by Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait. In theheart of Europe  Yugoslavia was on the path to politicaldisintegration. Few of us imagined then  however  thenightmare of Bosnia  the genocide to come in Rwanda orthe mass starvation and anarchy in Somalia. In response during our term on the Security Council in 1993 and 1994 a record 75 000 United Nations peacekeepers weredeployed around the world  and Iraq’s invasion of Kuwaitwas robustly countered by coalition action authorized bythe Security Council. New Zealand was part of thatcoalition and is part of the current efforts to ensure thatIraq complies with subsequent Council decisions. Recentevents show that we still need to be vigilant. Iraq mustrecognize that there are limits to what the internationalcommunity will tolerate.New Zealanders also serve in the former Yugoslaviawhere  while the implementation of the Dayton accordslies primarily with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization(NATO)  the United Nations continues to play animportant role. Similarly  our personnel serve in Angolaand the Middle East.New Zealanders are staunch supporters of the UnitedNations role in international peacekeeping  despite the factthat the overall record through the first half of this decadehas been mixed. There were successes  such as Cambodia Mozambique and El Salvador  and there were thedisappointments and bitter frustrations of Bosnia  Somaliaand Rwanda. I hesitate to call those operations failures.To me  that would be to overlook the positive things theyachieved in extremely difficult circumstances and thecontributions made by so many dedicated and able people.Those operations will be failures only if we fail to learnfrom them. I think we have learned.We have learned that  first  the United Nations mustbe given the resources required to do the job. Secondly the Organization must be careful about mixingenforcement tasks with peacekeeping  unless ourpeacekeepers are appropriately configured from the outsetfor the higher level of threat.Thirdly  the Security Council should be wary ofadopting resolutions to which the Organization cannotgive effect. This creates a very corrosive credibilityproblem.My Government also considers that the UnitedNations must continue its efforts to develop a capacity torespond more rapidly. We commend the proposal toestablish a rapidly deployable operational headquartersteam and  indeed  have offered to contribute a highlyexperienced officer to it.Demining remains an important focus for NewZealand. Mines pose an unacceptable threat topeacekeeping operations and are a longer-term2humanitarian and development challenge. The UnitedNations must make every effort to ensure that the necessaryresources are available for demining activities.We have more than doubled our annual instalment tothe United Nations Voluntary Trust Fund for Assistance inMine Clearance. This is in addition to our continuingcontribution of expertise in demining in Cambodia Mozambique and Angola  as well as here at United NationsHeadquarters.Finally  we do not think the United Nations can writeitself out of the script when operations involving a potentialenforcement dimension are contemplated. If it did so  itcould quickly become irrelevant. The threats to internationalpeace and security in the future are likely to be every bit asdifficult as those of the recent past. The United Nations willneed to be able to respond effectively  not simply as arubber stamp for great-Power actions.The tragic events of recent days in the West Bank andGaza show that peace there remains elusive. New Zealandcalls upon all parties to desist from actions that might derailthe Middle East peace process. Painstaking efforts havegone into that process  and it offers a real hope for a long-term solution to the problems that have bedeviled thatregion. It must be supported and not jeopardized.Human rights are the foundation of freedom andjustice  and the achievement of universal respect for humanrights is an essential prerequisite for international peace andsecurity.In New Zealand we work hard to ensure that our ownhouse is in order. We are committed to ensuring that therights elaborated in the Universal Declaration of HumanRights  the Covenants and other core human rightsinstruments are a living reality for all New Zealanders  andwe are prepared to speak out when we see human rightsbeing violated in other parts of the world. At its heart  ourinternational human rights policy is geared to findingtangible ways of protecting and promoting human rightsand good government.In the Asia-Pacific region we are pleased by theprogress the United Nations is making in nurturing humanrights frameworks. We are also encouraged by the newlevels of cooperation and interaction being achieved by thehuman rights commissions of the region.New Zealand also sees a need to support individualcountries  international and regional organizations and non-governmental organizations in their work to improvehuman rights and the quality of governance. To this endthe Minister for Foreign Affairs has today announced theestablishment of an international good-governmentprogramme. This new programme will markedly expandour ability to support good government and human rightscapacity-building activities. It will work in tandem withthe existing Commonwealth Good Government Fund.Consistent with United Nations principles  NewZealand has also participated actively in the Action Groupof Commonwealth Ministers for the promotion ofprinciples of good governance established at theCommonwealth Heads of Government meeting at Hararein 1991 and reaffirmed at its Auckland meeting in 1995.For my own part  I have been privileged to represent NewZealand at several of the Action Group’s meetings andduring its recent mission to Gambia.Such programmes  with the interlinked goals ofsocial progress and economic development  do not comecheaply. The money spent on United Nations relief anddevelopment greatly surpasses that spent on peacekeeping and so it should.At the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 itwas recognized that substantial new and additionalfunding would be required for sustainable developmentand the implementation of Agenda 21  the programme ofaction that will take us into the next century.I am pleased to be able to say that by next year NewZealand will have increased its official developmentassistance by almost one third since Rio. There will be a24 per cent increase in our funding for United Nationsdevelopment agencies this year.1997 will see the five-year review of Agenda 21. Atthe special session of the General Assembly next June one important task will be to assess the effectiveness ofthe bodies and institutions that have been established toadvance the aims set out in Agenda 21. The issues aremany  and all are important. But we need to focus effortsand produce real results.In this regard  the Commission on SustainableDevelopment should have a strengthened role. It shouldbe the forum in which States can work to streamline theenvironment-and-sustainable- development agenda.All these challenges facing this unique Organization and our regard for it  highlight of course the urgent need3for reform. In particular  the Security Council must bemade more representative of the Organization’s membershipas it is today  not as it was 50 years ago. Its decision-making procedures must be brought up to date.Finding a sustainable basis for the financing of theOrganization remains long overdue. New Zealand hasdedicated itself to reform of both the Secretariat and theintergovernmental machinery  not least through ourvigorous commitment to the work of the Open-ended High-level Working Group on the Strengthening of the UnitedNations System. The report of that group provides ablueprint for action during this session. We also support theEfficiency Board  and have made available to it the servicesof a New Zealand expert in public-service restructuring.We believe that New Zealand’s record  not only as aprompt contributor of assessments  but also as a countrythat has demonstrated its commitment to financial reform places it in a good position to make an effectivecontribution to the work of the Advisory Committee onAdministrative and Budgetary Questions  in which we areseeking membership at this year’s session of the GeneralAssembly.The drive for reform of the United Nations system tomake it an effective instrument of the internationalcommunity for the next 50 years means no part of it canremain immune from scrutiny.A good deal of attention has been focused on theSecurity Council  the General Assembly and the Secretariat.We believe there is also scope for increasing theeffectiveness of the International Court of Justice. It is 50years since the ICJ was established as the principal UnitedNations judicial organ. To mark this important milestone inthe international rule of law  we should now finallyschedule a conference to adopt the statute for theinternational criminal court. The creation of a permanentcourt that will bring justice to victims of genocide  crimesagainst humanity  war crimes and other serious internationalcrimes is surely a priority for us all.I am grateful to have had this opportunity to reaffirmNew Zealand’s commitment to this Organization  and tomultilateralism  as the means for building a better world."
"129",5397,"OMN",51,1996,"﻿Atthe outset and on behalf of my delegation  allow me tocongratulate Ambassador Razali on his election as Presidentof the General Assembly at its fifty-first session. Oman haslong enjoyed close friendly relations with his country Malaysia  and we are confident that given his leadershipand vast diplomatic experience our deliberations willreach a meaningful and successful conclusion  to whichend we shall cooperate in every way.I would like to take this opportunity to pay specialtribute to his predecessor  Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral the representative of the fraternal country of Portugal  forthe exemplary manner in which he steered the work ofthe previous session.We also wish to convey our sincere thanks andappreciation for the unwavering support of the Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali. He has enhancedand reinvigorated the role of the United Nations in allareas of interest  in spite of the problems and obstaclesfaced by the international Organization as a result of itsrecent financial crisis.Our celebration last year of the fiftieth anniversary the Nations golden jubilee  offered us a uniqueopportunity to review and contemplate the tremendousand substantial achievements of this body over the pastfive decades  during which this international Organizationhas made vigorous efforts to save the internationalcommunity from the scourge of war and to alleviate thesufferings of vulnerable peoples throughout the world. Weare fully confident of the United Nations capability todischarge the responsibilities entrusted to it in future bythe international community.Although the world widely considers the MiddleEast to be a region of great significance  a comprehensivepeace has not yet been achieved there. The internationalcommunity witnessed an important breakthrough with theconvening of the 1991 Madrid Peace Conference aimedat reaching a comprehensive and peaceful solution to thisissue. Since then  concerted and positive steps have beentaken to achieve that long-awaited objective  such as thesigning of many agreements and conventions between themain parties to the conflict  particularly on thePalestinian-Israeli and Jordanian-Israeli tracks. Such stepshave made the peace process in the Middle East moredeep-rooted and irrevocable.All these attempts have been made through thecourageous and strenuous efforts of the concerned partiesin the Middle East  with the help of international supportand assistance. My country’s contribution has includedsupport and encouragement of these steps through itscontacts with the concerned parties at the bilateral andmultilateral levels of the peace negotiations  notably theagreement to establish commercial ties with Israel and19other accords with the Palestinian Authority  as well as theagreement reached by the group of founder countries toestablish a Middle East research centre for waterdesalination.Because of the procrastination and hesitation of thenewly elected Government of Israel fully to implement allprevious agreements  the peace process in the Middle Eastrequires  now more than ever before  the support of theinternational community.The peace process in the Middle East is a mutualresponsibility of and full partnership between the Arabcountries and Israel. In a partnership  every party must reapthe fruits of peace or bear the risks and losses. Proceedingfrom this understanding  all parties must be treated on anequal footing. Furthermore  my country sees no justificationfor Israel’s continued blockading of the Palestinian cities both from the humanitarian point of view and because itundermines all relations between the Palestinian people andtheir Israeli counterparts  as was recently seen in the bloodyconfrontations that occurred in Al-Quds following theopening of a tunnel by the Israeli Government at an Islamicholy site. Moreover  the expansion of hostilities at theexpense of the peace negotiations will serve no one but theenemies of peace and the supporters of confrontation andanimosity.Given such unacceptable measures  my country’sefforts to promote the principles of confidence-building andmutual cooperation in this area will be hampered anddelayed. We call upon the Government of Israel to closethe tunnel. At the same time  we hope that the summit tobe hosted today by President Clinton in Washington will besuccessful.My country calls upon Israel to assume its primaryresponsibility for revitalizing the peace process by resumingthe peace negotiations and taking credible steps towards thetangible and practical implementation of all agreementsreached in this regard. It also hopes that the progressachieved at the Madrid Peace Conference will have apositive impact on all tracks  including the Syrian-Israeliand Lebanese-Israeli tracks. We believe that it is high timefor the concerned parties to capitalize on the lessons of thepast and work together in order to restore the momentumof peace and achieve a comprehensive settlement of thisissue. In order to preserve the momentum of the peaceprocess  my country will stand ready to extend everypossible assistance and to take positive steps to enhance thepeace process in the Middle East.My country expresses its satisfaction with thesituation in Iraq in the aftermath of the recent events anddevelopments in the north of the country  which raisedtensions and nearly destabilized the region again. We callupon all concerned parties to abide by international lawand to focus on the implementation of the relevantSecurity Council resolutions on Iraq  as well as to resumeand activate the negotiations between the conflictingparties  in order to maintain the sovereignty and territorialintegrity of Iraq.On the other hand  we welcome the memorandum ofunderstanding signed between Iraq and the UnitedN a t i o n s   a l l o w i n g I r a q t o i m p l e m e n tresolution 986 (1995). In our view  if implemented  thatresolution will help alleviate the suffering of the brotherlypeople of Iraq. While drawing the internationalcommunity’s attention to the irrelevant linkage betweenthe implementation of the aforementioned resolution andrecent events in northern Iraq  and to the humanitarianappeals inside the country  we call on Iraq to cooperatefully with the United Nations in a manner that guaranteesthe effective and swift implementation of this resolution.Iraq is also requested to cooperate with the UnitedNations in implementing other international resolutions onthe release of Kuwaiti detainees and properties and thenationals of other countries detained in Iraq  in the hopethat Iraq’s full compliance and further cooperation withthe United Nations Special Commission on Iraq will pavethe way for the possible lifting of the internationalembargo and the restoration of peace and stability in theregion.With regard to the question of disarmament  theUnited Nations has played an important role in diffusingthe threat of weapons of mass destruction and promotingan equitable balance between the regional Powers. Mycountry has participated in the Commission onDisarmament’s meetings on regional security as part of aninternational effort to reactivate peace negotiations in theMiddle East. While actively supporting the Commission the Sultanate of Oman would point out that such effortsalone cannot guarantee equitable security in the region ifthey are not paired with other effective and practicalmeasures to eliminate weapons of mass destruction thereand to promote comprehensive and unconditionalacceptance of international monitoring and inspection ofall activities related to this matter.The Sultanate of Oman was also among the firstcountries to sign the Convention on the Prohibition of theDevelopment  Production  Stockpiling and Use of20Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction and the firstcountry in the Middle East to ratify it. This is a clearindication of my country’s distinctive role in enhancingsecurity and stability in the region and throughout theworld. Similarly  it is a great honour for me to announce tothis international forum the Sultanate’s decision to accedeto the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons(NPT)  in the hope that other countries that have not yetdone so will follow the same course before the end of theyear so as to ensure the Treaty’s universality and to securea world free of all weapons of mass destruction in whichall mankind can live in peace  love and prosperity. Mycountry  like many others  voted in favour of this Treatyand  while we salute all who contributed to this majorachievement  we call on the United Nations not to stophere  but to continue its efforts to free the world once andfor all from all nuclear weapons and weapons of massdestruction. We call upon the nuclear-weapon States inparticular to implement time-bound programmes in order toachieve this noble objective as soon as possible.We would like to express our deep concern and regretvis-à-vis terrorist acts that target the lives of innocentpeople — including children  women and the elderly — andviolate their legitimate right to live in peace and prosperity.The international community should take immediate andcollective action to combat this phenomenon. We supportall sincere and faithful efforts to convene an internationalconference to address and eliminate this problem andrelated aspects and to ensure that the perpetrators of suchterrorist acts do not go unprosecuted and are brought tojustice.The Dayton Agreement for Bosnia and Herzegovina signed a year ago  has proved to be the optimal solution forputting an end to that tragic four-year war  which killed wounded or displaced many Bosnians. My countrywelcomes this historic Agreement and made every possibleeffort as a Security Council member and at regional andinternational forums to put an end to the suffering of theBosnian people and the atrocities committed against themand to restore security  stability and prosperity to all thepeoples of the Balkans. We hope that the results of theelections held recently in Bosnia will pave the way for abetter and prosperous future in which the people of Bosniaand Herzegovina can live in peace  tranquillity andcooperation.Effective participation in international and regionalconferences on environmental issues is one of the ways inwhich the Sultanate of Oman is helping to improve andcoordinate its environmental policies. My country hasplayed an active role in many of these conferences andhas hosted some as a contribution to increasing publicawareness at the national  regional and internationallevels. We are fully convinced that  through concertedefforts  the international community can preserve theenvironment and the world’s ecosystems. We emphasizethe need for all countries to participate effectively in theinternational agreements and conventions aimed atconserving the ecological system  preventingenvironmental degradation  enhancing internationalscientific exchange and creating an internationalinformation network.In Oman  we focus consistently on the developmentof human resources  the improvement of our technical andvocational education  the encouragement of the privatesector and economic diversification. Our fifthdevelopment plan  initiated at the beginning of this year has several objectives  including the improvement oftechnical and vocational education in Oman  theencouragement of the private sector and economicdiversification and the establishment of an economicbalance conducive to foreign investment. We have alsoupdated our tax systems in accordance with an equationthat would establish a level playing field for foreigninvestments. A financial centre has recently beenestablished in Muscat to deal with the activities of foreigntrade and investments in Oman. The commercial andregional economic groups have had a major impact oninternational efforts to expand the range of mutualeconomic interests and influence the free flow of tradeand investment throughout the world. In this context  mycountry has participated with its sister countries of theGulf Cooperation Council (GCC) in exploring everypossible means to promote and expand free trade andinvestment among these countries or between any otherinternational groups.My country has also participated actively infounding a new economic group of the littoral States ofthe Indian Ocean  including several African countries  totrigger commercial activity among these countries develop economic cooperation and maximizeopportunities for the present and future investment andexploitation of their natural and human resources in thebest interests of their peoples. We are confident that theestablishment of such a new economic group  whichembraces many countries with deep-rooted historic andcultural ties  will ultimately enhance cooperation betweenits member States and affect other economic factors  suchas raw materials  human resources and energy.21Here I would like to talk about Africa. A number ofAfrican countries are still suffering from the aftermath ofthe cold war  which resulted in internal political turmoil andcrisis  leading to a decline in gross national products.Africa’s role is indispensable. We have to help it assume itsnatural place on the international scene. We therefore callupon the United Nations and the international communityto continue to extend assistance to Africa through furthercooperation with all its regional organizations.Technological progress has greatly speededcommunications between countries and economicadvancement. My country welcomes the outcome of thesummit of industrial countries held last June in Lyon France  at which these countries reaffirmed their solidaritywith the international community’s efforts to solve theproblems and reduce the burdens associated withglobalization. Similarly  the developing countries shouldbenefit from the outcome of the Uruguay Round.The developing countries are pushing to adopt market-economy policies and undertaking further structuraleconomic reforms in support of free trade and investment.They are also looking forward to the capital flows andtechnology transfers that can help strengthen their economicand social development  improve the quality of theirproductivity and upgrade their services. This in turn willenable these countries to increase their development  widentheir markets and enhance the international competitivenessof developing countries  creating a more independent worldin which stability and prosperity will prevail.My Government has already requested fullmembership in the World Trade Organization (WTO). Wehave been following its work for a year now. Our accessionto WTO membership would be a big step for us. It wouldenhance our development  promote our services andupgrade our productivity standards to the fullest levelpossible. To that end  we must guarantee a reasonablebalance between our national interests and regional andinternational benefits. In this context  the Sultanate ofOman  as a developing country  has been looking forwardto receiving the global support and assistance which  underthe generalized system of preferences  the internationalcommunity extends to developing countries to help themaddress the challenges posed by economic reforms andstructural adjustment. In both the short and long terms  theinternational community should continue to enhance thissystem.As can be seen in its national legislation and norms such as the national law of commercial signs and thepatenting system which governs new inventions within thecountries of the GCC  Oman has played a commendablerole in protecting intellectual property. Furthermore  a lawto protect copyrights and publications has been enactedin the general context of updating and improving thelegislation and norms of trade and investment in Oman.Given Oman’s support of the principles embodied in thenew global trend to protect intellectual property rights andits desire fully to participate and cooperate in this regard my Government has decided to accede to the WorldIntellectual Property Organization.As we approach the twenty-first century  we areprompted by hope to continue to work and cooperatecollectively in maintaining international peace andsecurity to enhance life for the current and futuregenerations. Such an objective cannot be achieved withoutthe firm commitment of the international community toreviewing and adopting clear economic guidelines for anurgent and serious approach to the establishment of apermanent  effective economic mechanism to deal withthis matter for the benefit of all of mankind. The UnitedNations should assume the primary responsibility ofaddressing these great challenges and discharge in aneffective manner the global duties entrusted to it by theinternational community.We appreciate the complexity of the task ofreforming the United Nations and its organs  but we alsobelieve that it can be accomplished through theestablishment of dynamic and cost-effective mechanismsfor achieving selected goals and meeting the urgent needsof future development plans.We support the Secretary-General’s medium-termproposals for an objective strategy for the programmes ofthe future work of the United Nations. In this connection we express our concern regarding the deterioration of thefinancial situation of the United Nations. We urgeMember States to fulfil their financial obligations andthus enable the United Nations to carry out its functionseffectively. We would also emphasize the responsibilityof the Security Council — its permanent members inparticular — to their financial commitments topeacekeeping operations  in coordination with the variousregional and international bodies of the United Nations which collectively endeavour to secure appropriatesolutions to international conflicts. We call on theinternational community to accelerate its efforts to reviewand reform the administrative organs of the UnitedNations in a manner that conforms to the globalaspirations and expectations of the forthcoming century."
"130",5443,"PAK",51,1996,"﻿On behalf of 130 millionPakistanis  please accept  Sir  greetings on assuming thepresidency of this session of the General Assembly.I come to address the Assembly in the twilight of thetwentieth century  where we seem to be  in the words ofCharles Dickens  at “the best of times” and at “the worst oftimes”. A century now comes to a close which witnessedtwo world wars  a Holocaust  hunger  hopelessness and thespectre of nuclear annihilation.But there is another twentieth century that we shouldremember. The candle flickers on a century that broughtmankind a technological and information revolutionbeyond our wildest dreams; a century of breakthroughs inmedicine and health  in communication  in energy  intransportation and in agriculture; a century that witnessedthe triumph of liberty over authoritarianism  the triumphof the free market over government control. One historianhas called the twentieth century the age of extremes.Tested time and again  the world survived.I come before this Assembly  at this time oftransition from one century to the next — from thesecond millennium to the third — to speak of history  ofjustice and of morality. Today  the United Nations standsat the crossroads  not just of the calendar  but of thedirection of the community of nations.We confront three simultaneous challenges. The firstone is the proliferation of conflicts  disputes and tensionsamong and within nations  and the accompanying rise ofnational  ethnic and religious prejudice  intolerance andarrogance. The second challenge is the persistent spreadof poverty. The third challenge is the growing sense ofalienation  the loss of people’s hope and confidence thatthe world’s Governments will address successfully themultifaceted problems inherent in the new technologicalera. The manner in which we address these problems willdetermine the quality of life that we bequeath ourchildren.We remain deeply concerned at the conflicts anddisputes in many parts of the world — in Bosnia  inChechnya and in Azerbaijan. Our confidence in our abilityto resolve conflicts has been visibly shaken after theexperiences of Somalia  Afghanistan  Azerbaijan  Tajikistan Liberia  Rwanda and Burundi.We hope that the Middle East peace process welcomed by the world  will not be reversed and that allparties will honour their obligations under the agreementssigned.The success of the Dayton Agreement and therestoration of peace and justice in Bosnia and Herzegovinawill be an acid test of the world community’s will toprevent aggression and genocide in the future.Yet there is another place on Earth where there is atest of strength between the principles of law and freedomand the force of aggression and foreign occupation. Afterthe creation of the United Nations  the people of Jammuand Kashmir were among the first to have their right toself-determination recognized by the Security Council. Ishould like to quote the words of the Security Councilitself:“the final disposition of the State of Jammu andKashmir will be made in accordance with the will ofthe people expressed through the democratic methodof a free and impartial plebiscite conducted under theauspices of the United Nations.” (Security Councilresolution 122 (1957)  second preambular paragraph)After 50 years  the Kashmiri people still await thefulfilment of this resolution  of this commitment  of thispromise.The great African-American poet Langston Hughesasked fundamental questions about liberty. He asked:“What happens to a dream deferred?Does it dry uplike a raisin in the sun?Or fester like a sore —And then run? (...)Maybe it just sagslike a heavy load.Or does it explode?”In 1989  as the winds of freedom swept across theglobe  blowing away dictatorship  domination andoccupation  a new generation of Kashmiris rose to demandtheir right to self-determination  a right that had passedfrom father to son  from mother to daughter — a torchrekindled from generation to generation. To suppress thebrave Kashmiri youth  India sent in 600 000 military andparamilitary forces. The tools of murder  torture  rape persecution  arson  incarceration and assassinationattempts were ruthlessly used. But as the Nobel PeaceLaureate Martin Luther King said “Freedom is never voluntarily given by theoppressor. It must be demanded by the oppressed.”Forty thousand Kashmiris have given their lives inopposing this oppression during the last seven yearsalone. India has recruited and trained renegades to subvertthe Kashmiri movement  to create dissension and totarnish the image of the struggle for freedom. Undermounting international pressure  India sought thisSeptember to divert world opinion by organizing a shamelection. Those very people who claim to be front-runnersin the elections cannot even enter the valley withoutarmed escorts  much less muster popular support.This is what the world’s media had to say. The ArabNews of 8 September 1996 reported that its correspondentvisited Baramula that morning and saw the entire towndeserted. Not a single person was visible on the streets which were being heavily patrolled. The New York Timesof 7 September 1996 reported that while India hopes thatthe elections will blunt the guerrillas’ appeal  there aremany in Srinagar who say New Delhi is chasing anillusion. The Economic Times  an Indian publication  of17 September 1996 reported that a number of booths inAnantnag and Pulwama recorded single-digit voting  evenas late as 3 p.m. The Statesman  another Indianpublication  reported on 22 September 1996 that Srinagarput up a stiff resistance to elections that day  and thatpolling was held in a curfew-like atmosphere on desertedstreets. According to the Voice of America’s broadcast of27 September 1996  United States Senator Tom Harkinsaid that these elections were fraudulent and would not beconsidered to reflect the legitimate aspirations of theKashmiri masses.The Chairman of the Kashmir All Parties HurriyatConference  Mir Umar Farooq  declared that suchelections cannot be a substitute for the Kashmiris’ right toself-determination.The United Nations Security Council declared inresolution 122 (1957) that the organization of suchelections does not “constitute a disposition of the State”2(resolution 122 (1957)  operative para. 1) in terms of theplebiscite to be held under the auspices of the UnitedNations. This was confirmed by a recent study by theInternational Commission of Jurists.I should like India to remember the words of theFrenchman André Breton  who said:“There is nothing with which it is so dangerous totake liberties as liberty itself.”So I stand before the United Nations GeneralAssembly and urge “to thine own self be true”  to thineown Charter be true; and to thine own resolutions be true.India may argue that the Security Council resolutionsthat guaranteed a plebiscite to Jammu and Kashmir are old but there is no statute of limitations on United Nationsresolutions. Occupation  repression and annexation cannotnullify the actions of the Security Council itself. Theresolutions of this body cannot be applied selectively onlywhen politically expedient.Pakistan calls on the United Nations to implement itsown Security Council resolutions 47 (1948)  51 (1948)  80(1950)  96 (1951)  98 (1952) and 122 (1957) — sevenspecific and binding resolutions guaranteeing self-determination to the people of Jammu and Kashmir.Kashmir is the core issue that divides India andPakistan. I had proposed a meaningful dialogue to the newIndian Prime Minister on his assumption of office  and wasencouraged by his positive response. Unfortunately  the newGovernment persisted with the strategy of a sham electionin occupied Jammu and Kashmir.The Kashmir dispute has led to four direct or indirectwars between India and Pakistan between 1947 and 1971.India has the third-largest army in the world today  almostall of which is deployed against my country Pakistan.South Asia lacks a regional security system. We inPakistan have made several proposals for conventional armscontrol: first  the negotiation of a mutually agreed ratio offorces; secondly  measures to prevent the possibility of asurprise attack; and thirdly  the adoption of agreedprinciples for conventional arms control in South Asia.Over the past 30 years  Pakistan has formulated aseries of proposals to contain proliferation of nuclear andmissile technology in South Asia. All along  India arguedthat it opposed bilateral or regional measures and wouldaccept only a global non-proliferation policy. TheComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty is exactly thekind of global measure for non-proliferation anddisarmament that India had been championing for 40years. Yet  unfortunately  India chose to veto the Treatyin the Geneva Conference on Disarmament  and itopposed the Treaty at the United Nations GeneralAssembly just last month. So now the world can see thereality.Let me state that just as we are prepared to sign anyand all nuclear treaties if India simultaneously signs withus  any step in nuclear escalation by our neighbour willfind a response from us to preserve our national security.I should like to take this opportunity to propose tothis Assembly that it endorse the convening of amultilateral dialogue for peace and security in South Asia with the participation not only of Pakistan and India  butof the five permanent members of the Security Counciland other major Powers  such as Germany and Japan.This multilateral conference could cover three criticalareas: first  the resolution of the Kashmir dispute andother bilateral problems between India and Pakistan;secondly  the promotion of conventional arms control andconfidence-building measures; and thirdly  measures topromote nuclear restraint and avert the danger of anuclear-arms race in South Asia. I believe that suchmultilateral talks offer a framework for genuinenegotiations that can lead to a resolution of disputes  avertthe nuclear threat and promote prosperity in South Asia.I hope this proposal will receive the support of thisAssembly and of India.A clear distinction has been made by the UnitedNations between terrorism and the legitimate struggle fornational liberation. We in Pakistan will always be at theforefront of the effort to combat terrorism because wehave frequently been victims of these crimes from acrossour own borders. This year alone we faced a series ofcross-border terrorist attacks  but  by the grace of God we were successful in arresting different rings of cross-border terrorists.However  I should like to take this opportunity toexpress deep concern  on behalf of one billion peace-loving Muslims  at the propaganda from certain quarters.Some quarters are trying to present terrorism as peculiarto the followers of Islam; this is wrong. There is no placein Islam for acts of terrorism. However  let usacknowledge that in the post-cold-war period we arewitnessing the rise of extremist fringe groups in the East3and in the West. Whether it be Hindu fundamentalism Islamic militancy  Judaic extremism  Le Pen’s racism inFrance  or the Oklahoma bombing in America  a number ofyouth are turning to acts of violence. We who believe inthe policies of moderation  accommodation and tolerancemust unite against this new threat of violence and terror.International mechanisms and systems to check the agentsof terror need strengthening  and we must condemnterrorists and extremists with one voice  irrespective of theirrace  religion or creed.Pakistan is the second-largest Muslim country in theworld. It is a democracy  and the Government I lead isdetermined to turn Pakistan into a fortress of enlightenment emancipation and social advancement. This is no easy taskgiven our recent history. The Afghan war led to theproliferation of arms and militancy in our region  and to therise of ethnic  sectarian and separatist forces in the country.It spawned a drug culture and failed to equip our youth foremployment in the modern world.Today we face  along with other countries of theworld  the dangers of debt  deficit and demography. I amproud to say that we in Pakistan have brought down ourpopulation growth rate from 3.1 per cent to 2.9 per cent.We hope to reduce it further  to 2.6 per cent. In the lastthree years  we have brought down our deficit by threepoints  and a billion dollars of debt has been retired.However  the cost has been heavy.Each year we have had to present a harsh budget topull our country out of the quicksand of debt  deficit anddemography. This year alone  out of new budgetarymeasures of PRs. 40 billion  PRs. 22 billion went to debtservicing. The example of Pakistan shows why increasingnumbers of the world’s population live in poverty andsqualor  without access to clean drinking water  sanitation schools or hospitals.These bleak realities of debt servicing breed a despairand frustration that often manifest as random violence andterrorism. Despite this grinding poverty  the aspirations ofthe marginalized keep rising due to the communicationsrevolution sweeping the world.The world needs to devise a system under whichGovernments adopting international standards of trade andhuman values get proportionate relief in their debt.Shrinking aid flows have forced countries such as Pakistanto borrow capital at commercial interest rates. Indeed  debtservicing now accounts for 47 per cent of our budget. Thenegative impact of such reverse transfers needs to beredressed.Similarly  it is time to renew and implement thepledge of the developed nations to devote at least 0.7 percent of their gross national products for assistance to thedeveloping countries. Even this target has now dwindledto a level of 0.3 per cent of the gross national product ofthe developed world.We in Pakistan  committed to the dream of ourfounding fathers  have chosen the path of a federalparliamentary democracy wedded to the concept of socialequality. Under a democratic Government  Pakistan hasplayed a responsible role in combating terrorism andnarcotics  promoting the rights of women and children and working on non-proliferation issues such as theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. We have donethis while confronting the forces of ethnicity sectarianism  separatism and militancy that were tearingat our social fabric. Those who sought to undermine ourcountry’s unity by undermining peace in our port city ofKarachi have been defeated.We have a clear agenda as we move towards thetwenty-first century: a Pakistan dedicated to the rule oflaw and to safeguarding the rights of its women  childrenand minorities; a Pakistan providing equal opportunity forthe advancement of its citizens by investing in health andin education; a Pakistan that has already attracted over$22 billion in investment pledges.I speak to you  Mr. President  in the twilight of acentury that awaits the dawn of a fresh one. As I speak I dream of a third millennium in which the gap betweenrich and poor evaporates; in which illiteracy  hunger malnutrition and disease are at long last conquered; inwhich every child is planned  wanted  nurtured andsupported; and in which the birth of a girl is welcomedwith the same joy as that of a boy. I dream of amillennium of tolerance and pluralism  in which peoplerespect other people  nations respect other nations  andreligions respect other religions.That is the third millennium I see for my countryand others — for all children. Let the United Nations bethe infrastructure for making this dream into a reality."
"131",5486,"PAN",51,1996,"﻿The delegation of Panama wishes to join in the verywarm congratulations that the President has alreadyreceived from the speakers who have preceded me. Hiswell-deserved election as President of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-first session attests to his skills andpersonal merits  and at the same time reflects the esteemthat Malaysia  a prominent member of the Association ofSouth-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) has come to enjoy inthe family of nations.I am also very pleased that this particular part of ourmeeting is being chaired by our colleague from thePhilippines  Ambassador Mabilangan.Allow me on this solemn occasion to pay tribute tothe eminent Portuguese statesman Diogo Freitas doAmaral  who presided over the historic fiftieth sessionwith great wisdom  poise and humanism and shed hisparticular light on the institutional reform of the UnitedNations.At the fiftieth session of the General AssemblyPanama proposed  together with the United States andFrance  that the United Nations and interested countriesshould take a decisive part in the holding of the UniversalCongress on the Panama Canal  which will take place inSeptember 1997. On that occasion the Assembly adoptedresolution 50/12 (1995)  which in its operative part “Urges the competent organs  programmes andspecialized agencies of the United Nations system in particular  the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme  the United Nations EnvironmentProgramme and the International MaritimeOrganization  to study the possibility of providingassistance from within existing resources for theorganization of the Universal Congress on thePanama Canal”. (resolution 50/12  para. 3)In the first operative paragraph the Assembly notedthat it“Supports the initiative of the Government ofPanama in convening the Universal Congress on thePanama Canal  with the participation ofGovernments  international bodies  public andprivate academic institutions  maritime users and7international shipping companies  to examine jointlythe role which the Panama Canal should play in thetwenty-first century”. (Ibid.  para. 1)The Government of Panama has a particular interest inseeing that Member States of the United Nations  as well asintergovernmental and non-governmental organizations ofthe international community  are informed about howPanama  as a sovereign State  is preparing to take on all theresponsibilities stemming from the final transfer of theinteroceanic canal in 1999  pursuant to the provisions of theTorrijos-Carter Treaties.One calendar year from the holding of the Congress I wish to inform the General Assembly that the PanamanianGovernment is hard at work on preparations and steppingup consultations with international organizations andfriendly countries in order to secure meaningfulparticipation. The Panama Canal Congress will be universalin terms of participation; it will also be universal becausePanama  with its universalist and Bolivarian traditions  takesthe view that international maritime transport should beopen uninterruptedly to all the flags of the world on anequal footing and under a neutral and universal regime thatobliges us all to ensure its peaceful use and transit  takinginto account the expansion of international trade and thegrowth of the world economy.Ours is a time in which nations appear to be closerthan ever and in which there are tremendous opportunitiesto improve the living conditions of all. At the same time the existence of numerous imbalances  obstacles  risks anddangers gives Governments and peoples grounds forconcern.It is not only remarkable achievements of science technology and trade that are being globalized;unfortunately  hunger and environmental degradation arealso being globalized. There are still national andinternational situations that are marked by the denial offundamental values and that affect human rights and thefreedom of peoples. There are growing inequalities betweenmembers of our societies and between nations  and certaininjustices still persist in some aspects of internationalrelations. Arms trafficking and overt or covert resistance toagreements and initiatives to reverse the arms race are signsthat attitudes of expediency are prevailing  to the detrimentof our hopes for peace and agreement and our aspirationsto sustainable development. Terrorism  organized crime andtransnational crime conspire and feed off one another on anunprecedented international scale  exploiting the many facesof drug use  which is a threat to all mankind.These concerns dominated the agenda of the RioGroup at its tenth summit  held a month ago inCochabamba  Bolivia. It was an opportunity to underscoreat the highest possible political level the seriouschallenges facing Latin America and the Caribbean whose average poverty levels have reached alarminglevels despite the tremendous efforts of our Governmentsto reduce them.At that meeting the Panamanian Governmentstated — and I reaffirm here in this forum — that povertyand corruption are powerful forces threatening thedemocracies of the continent. On that occasion  thePresident of Panama  Mr. Ernesto Pérez Balladares stated:“When Nations embark on political adventuresdivorced from institutionality  they do not do sobecause they reject in theory the benefits ofdemocracy  but because they associate their owndespair with the regime under which they live ... Forthis reason  until the new concepts governingeconomic relations among countries today anddemocracy throughout the continent are accompaniedby investment in social sectors and a genuinemodernization of education to help close the gap  thesectors of the population affected by poverty willultimately reject what we here today quite rightlythink should be permanent values of modernsocieties.”For this reason  we wish to reiterate ourunderstanding of and solidarity with the problems ofhunger and poverty suffered by countries in other regions in particular the least developed countries  the majority ofwhich are in Africa  and certain countries in our regionthat are particularly vulnerable. Whatever may be thestandpoint chosen for consideration of the great issuescontained on the agenda of this fifty-first session of theGeneral Assembly  we should always approach them withthe desire to respond appropriately.The organization of social life always presupposesnormative vision and action. The United Nations hasproved its capacity to propose to the internationalcommunity a body of norms whose effectiveness dependson their universal application. The fundamental debatethat has been going on in the area of human rights sincethe creation of the United Nations has resulted in theenshrinement of those rights in legally binding texts andin declarations and programmes of action stemming fromthe major conferences held by the United Nations in8recent years. We are encouraged by the fact that thatenshrinement is encompassing the rights of solidarity in thecontext of problems concerning the environment population  society  women’s issues and housing.The Government of Panama is mindful of the complexdialectic interactions between peace  human rights anddevelopment. The desire to ensure effective democratizationin national life and to foster development is at the core ofthe activities the Panamanian Government is carrying out tobenefit children  young people  women  indigenous andrural populations  the disabled and certain particularlydisadvantaged urban groups.The Government’s activities relating to fulfilment ofthe Platform for Action adopted at the Beijing Conferenceon Women represent commitments strengthened by ourjustifiable satisfaction over Panama’s fairly encouragingindicators regarding the advancement of women. The accentis currently being placed on the sector of the femalepopulation living in unfavourable conditions of health housing and education and having little participation inpolitical life.In the context of this constantly renewed effort to findthe best solutions to national problems  the delegation ofPanama wishes to express to the Secretary-General ourthanks and recognition for the cooperation activities thathave been carried out in Panama by the United NationsDevelopment Programme  as a recognized and neutralfacilitator  to promote national consensus on the PanamaCanal issues. The successes already achieved in this areademonstrate that the actions of the United Nations itssystem in Panama are effective and have an impact on thelife of the nation.Three months ago Panama ratified the Convention onthe Law of the Sea  the implementation of which hasbecome more effective since the establishment of theInternational Seabed Authority and the InternationalTribunal for the Law of the Sea. Panama  as a maritimecountry  welcomes these promising developments and hopesthat there will be further achievements in the application ofthe Convention.The Government of Panama has great expectations forits future participation as a member of the GoverningCouncil of the United Nations Environment Programme andin the Commission on Sustainable Development. We willstrive to make our contribution and to prove ourcommitment to overcoming environmental problems. Thestrategic importance of issues associated with biodiversityis such that my Government hopes that new andadditional funds will be made available to promoteactivities in this field. We have the same hope inconnection with climate change  the ozone layer desertification and the conservation of forests.In the area of international peace and security  wereconfirm our agreement with those Governments thatadvocate a total ban on the production  use  trafficking inand transfer of anti-personnel land-mines. With respect tothe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty  which hasbeen signed by Panama  we continue to hold the sameview as in previous years. In this respect  we welcomeBrazil’s initiative to make the southern hemisphere a zonefree of nuclear weapons. This estimable initiative adds tothe efforts of Latin America and the Caribbean to fostera world free of nuclear weapons  efforts that werelaunched with the signing and ratification of theTlatelolco Treaty.Upon learning of the response of the InternationalCourt of Justice to the request issued by the GeneralAssembly at its forty-ninth session  my Governmentwelcomed the backing given by that principal organ ofthe United Nations to the negotiations on a ban onnuclear weapons  including tests. We signed theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty on theunderstanding that implicit in it is a commitment on thepart of world Powers to achieve a nuclear-weapon-freeworld.Panama has always supported those who believe thatif a part of the funds absorbed by the arms industry couldbe made available to combat poverty  ignorance anddisease  there would be positive changes all over the faceof our Earth.Panama has already expressed in the United Nationsits position and views on the problem of drugs  mostrecently at the high-level segment of the substantivesession of the Economic and Social Council in June. Wewould like to take this opportunity to reaffirm our supportof Mexico’s initiative  co-sponsored by the Rio Group  onconvening a special session of the General Assembly in1998  which would offer an opportunity to update thevarious debates  concepts  approaches and consensuspositions on the issue of illicit drugs and related crimes.The Government of Panama has made significant progressin developing the proposal presented to the Rio Group tocreate a multilateral centre in Panama to combat drugtrafficking and related crimes.9We are glad to announce the recent holding in ourcountry of the first international talks on the creation of thatcentre  attended by Bolivia  Ecuador  Colombia  Mexico Peru  Venezuela and Panama. We agreed at that meeting tohold another meeting in December 1996 to take decisionson the training module included in the plans for themultilateral training and research institute to combat drugtrafficking and related crimes. Another meeting will takeplace early in 1997 to study and decide upon theoperational module as a means of combatting drugtrafficking and related crimes  which is essentially civilianin nature and cooperating with the military forces that willlend additional support.In a similar vein  the Panamanian Government alsolends its support and solidarity to the internationalcommunity’s struggle to combat terrorism. Terroristactivity  no matter what the reasoning behind it may be  iscriminal and immoral  and exceeds all limits. Its sole faceis that of fanaticism. Terrorism is the offspring of theapocalypse  nihilistic and gratuitous in nature  capable ofcrushing human freedom and claiming a terrible harvest ofinnocent lives.Other topics on the agenda of this session of theGeneral Assembly are of particular interest to theGovernment of Panama. Negotiations on establishing anAgenda for Development oblige us not only to talk aboutthis but to act  prompted by the universal duty to cooperatewhich encompasses all individuals and all communities.The common undertaking of sustainable developmentshould be carried out through shared responsibilities. Forthis reason  we welcome the decision taken by MemberStates to politically reactivate the Economic and SocialCouncil. Now  what is needed is the political will to equipthe United Nations with an Agenda for Development whichwill not limit development solely to its economiccomponent: though that is necessary  it is not enough.Development should also provide the key part of commonwell-being and be placed at the service of purposesconsciously accepted by all  purposes that will enrich thelives of all  purposes that will enhance the creative capacityof every individual and be securely grounded in a humandimension which implies faith in oneself and paves the wayfor progress.Whatever approach is taken in addressing the majorissues on the agenda of this fifty-first session of theGeneral Assembly  the human being  his hopes andsufferings and the obstacles and opportunities he faces toimprove the quality of his life  should always haveprecedence. In spite of the dazzling clarity with which weperceive this certainty  it would seem that we sometimeslose sight of the fact that the human individual is theultimate focus of this Organization and of all theagreements and plans of actions that we arrive at withinit and stemming from it. All our decisions should bedesigned to meet the demands  needs  requirements andinterests of human beings.This requires a revitalization of the ethical side ofthe United Nations. My delegation appreciates theendeavours of the Secretary-General  Mr. BoutrosBoutros-Ghali. He has placed his unquestioned talent andefforts at the service of the Organization. His unswervinginternationalism and his commitment to world peace anddevelopment mean that Panama takes great pleasure inexpressing its gratitude for his work.A year ago we were welcoming the effort made bytwo great men who were struggling tirelessly toconsolidate peace agreements and move towards peacefulcoexistence in the Middle East. Today one of those menis no longer with us. Panama wishes to express aposthumous tribute of recognition to Yitzhak Rabin  amartyr of the peace process between two peoples Palestine and Israel  with which our people and ourGovernment have deeply-rooted friendly relations becausethe children of those peoples live together on our soil andare helping us to build a better country. Now thatfratricidal struggle is casting both nations into mourning Panama reaffirms its support for all the initiatives andresolutions that will strengthen peace and promotetolerance.We are very concerned about the events which tookplace as a result of changes effected in the Holy Sites ofJerusalem  to which the Security Council referred in itsresolution 1073 (1996) on Saturday  28 September 1996.The Security Council called for an immediate cessationand reversal of all acts that had resulted in theaggravation of the situation and that had negativeimplications for the Middle East peace process. Itlikewise called for the safety and protection of thePalestinian civilians to be ensured. Finally  it called forthe immediate resumption of negotiations within theMiddle East peace process on its agreed basis and thetimely implementation of the agreements reached.Another matter of concern to us relates to theChinese people  a people with which Panama hasmaintained relations since very early in the last century.My country has benefitted from a continued migrationwhich  from the building of the interoceanic railway to10that of the Canal  has contributed to our development andto the fashioning of our national identity. This deep-rootedand lasting relationship with the Chinese people hasstrengthened our nation’s and our Governments’ support forthe principle of the universality of the United Nations.Panama maintains diplomatic relations with the Republic ofChina and feels bound to state that those relations havebeen fruitful and beneficial. They have always beencharacterized by respect and have been receptive to andincorporated the interests and needs of both sides. For thisreason  we feel that our relations are exemplary in the bestpossible sense.On the other hand  in a few years’ time Panama willassume full responsibility for the interoceanic Canal and  inthe context of that responsibility  Panama mustacknowledge that the People’s Republic of China is one ofthe main users of the waterway both in terms of the numberof vessels and in terms of the volume of cargo originatingin or destined for the People’s Republic of China. We areencouraged by the fact that a significant number of Chinesecitizens and companies on both sides of the Taiwan Straitlive and work in harmony in Panama  where they have wonthe respect and affection of Panamanians because of theirdiligent hard work. We are convinced of the validity of theprinciple of one China  and we reaffirm our support for theefforts of both parties to unify the Chinese people. Wereiterate our conviction that they will achieve that purposein a framework of mutual respect that gradually helps tobuild trust between the two parties and create a favourableenvironment for Chinese reunification.The question of Security Council reform  the increasein the number of its members and other related matters isof irrefutable importance for the United Nations  as is thequestion of the strengthening of the role of the UnitedNations. It is unacceptable to try to change the membershipof the Security Council solely on the basis of supposedessential features that make certain countries more suitablethan others to join decision-making organs and hold seatsin the Security Council. Because of the functions itperforms  today’s state of affairs and a moral commitmentto the future of the United Nations  we call for a reform ofthe Security Council that will provide regionalrepresentation  an increase in both membershipcategories — permanent and non-permanent — andequitable distribution.The Government of Panama regards the Italianproposal as a democratic approach that responds to theconcern for representativity. We were encouraged by thewillingness to negotiate  with a view to achievingconsensus  voiced by the Italian Minister for ForeignAffairs last week from this rostrum. In the issues ofSecurity Council reform and the strengthening of the roleof the United Nations  the best possible ideas and loftiestpurposes should come into play. We wish to see a better more effective and more representative Security Council.We would also like to see opportunities to participate inthe United Nations go hand in hand with theresponsibility to act to ensure international peace andsecurity and for these to be seen from the perspective oftheir relationships with democracy and development. ThePanamanian Government has decided to reaffirm itssupport for Japan and Germany having permanent seatson the Security Council.I could not conclude without fulfilling my duty as aPanamanian to reiterate before this world Organizationthat Panama is ready to assume sovereign control over thePanama Canal in 1999  with all the administrative operational and security responsibilities entailed in the fullimplementation of the Torrijos-Carter Treaties.Panamanians’ shouldering of the main responsibility forthe Panama Canal will coincide with the advent of thetwenty-first century. We shall march resolutely into thenew millennium  looking forward to a promising future inwhich it will become clear that Panama’s universalistvocation has never wavered  and we strongly reaffirm thatvocation.Panama’s universalism  I am proud to say  is anethical one  capable of absorbing the most diversecurrents of thought and human action  whether from theNorth  South  East or West. Our geography made us thisway  and our history opened us up to the world —obviously  commercially  but above all culturally.As of 31 December 1999 Panama will be betterintegrated in the world because it will be able to makefree use of its entire territory for the integration of itsnation. We shall then have to cope with the tremendousneed to make full use of our potential and abilities and tofully exercise our rights and fulfil our responsibilities. On31 December 1999 the Panamanian nation will be at thecentre of an excitement sparked by the joining in ourveins and souls  of the past and the future  of thestruggles of generations  of joy and suffering and of themany endeavours that all bear the same name  a namethat designates a common objective  a single mission thatmany times engendered fervour and even heroism.In the twenty-first century  Panama will still be asmall country. What will be different  I repeat  is the fullintegration of the Panamanian nation in its territory  thesimple but intense and far-reaching meeting of a nationwith the entirety of its territory. The existence of aninteroceanic waterway  the Panama Canal  in that territorywill prompt us to pursue  step up and deepen our efforts toestablish the right approaches and institutions to completeour sovereign life as a nation and to facilitate the fulfilmentof our universalist vocation. That universalism will make itpossible for us to continue to participate in the realities ofa globalized and interdependent world with the desire tomake it a source of mutual enrichment  openness  initiativeand creativity.It is a fortunate historical coincidence that onWednesday of this week  2 October 1996  the GeneralCouncil of the World Trade Organization (WTO) decidedto accept the report of its subsidiary organ concerningPanama’s accession  thus ensuring its entry as a fullmember of the World Trade Organization. We welcome thefact that  with the accession of Panama  all countries in theLatin American region have become members of the WTO.We all aspire to see a United Nations that will beready to deal with present and future problems. Panamahopes to contribute to the vital consensuses and aspires tobecome part of the necessary renewal of the UnitedNations. As part of the Panamanian experience since thecreation of the United Nations  I personally have taken partin the Organization’s intergovernmental machinery oftenenough to be able to speak of faith. With faith in theUnited Nations  we have often been capable of movingmountains of mistrust and misunderstanding  which havecovered the world in a landscape of conflict and deadlock.Thanks to that faith in the United Nations  today we canspeak of new generations of human rights and newgenerations of peacekeeping operations  which  in the viewof men and women of my generation are proof that theUnited Nations represents a victory over the erosive effectsof time and history.My delegation believes that the United Nations hasaccomplished wonderful tasks through its constructiveconsideration of various manifestations of human diversityand through the taking of decisions that give them aproductive  secure and peaceful place on Earth."
"132",5533,"PER",51,1996,"﻿At the outset  allow me Sir  to convey to you and to this Assembly the greetingsand congratulations of the Peruvian people  as well astheir best wishes and hopes for the future.Peru is a country that has successfully dealt with itsdomestic contradictions  and which is looking with visionand determination towards the broad new horizons ofinternational activity. A careful review of what has beenachieved to date reveals that much remains to be done;but it also shows that we are following the right course inaddressing the demands of our times.However  it would be superficial to use thisAssembly  whose central theme is the reform of theUnited Nations  to recapitulate the events of the past year.We must wake up to the outcome of a long historicalprocess that has accelerated markedly over the last quarterof a century and established around the world a networkof international organizations that today exceed thenumber of States. We must also wake up to a fortunatenew development: the individual human being hasacquired a position of cardinal importance in theinternational system.The organizations established by States to satisfyinternational  human and regional needs  have acquired apermanent character and have created new systems ofinternational relations. When we speak today of reformingthe United Nations  no one fails to acknowledge that newmechanisms are required to promote greater developmentand economic and social stability in the world  and toface current and future conflicts between and withinStates.There is discussion of the possibility of creating anew economic council and a new social council  as wellas expanding and strengthening the Security Council. Atthe same time  the need has emerged to transform andrationalize the United Nations system  together with theimperative of resolving the Organization’s financial crisis.But in order to carry out those reforms  we need to havea clear-sighted appreciation of the international scene andto adapt the Organization to that reality  so that we canachieve a fruitful and forward-looking perspective. It isnecessary for States  in the framework of the UnitedNations system  to overcome their traditional activitiesand jointly engage in tasks to deal with those newrealities so as to achieve broader representation andfunctionality  with the possibility of future growth.13When the United Nations was founded in 1945  at theend of the Second World War  international relations weredifferent from today. The end of the cold war and therealities of regional integration have made necessary a newvision of the relationship between State sovereignty and thesupra-national realities of the international system. Hugesocial and economic challenges make it necessary for us topersevere in pursuing the purposes and principles of theCharter  to strengthen diplomatic action  and not tosuccumb to arbitrary interpretations of international legality which undermine the indispensable primacy of internationallaw.Today the inadequacy of the nation State is moreevident than ever  and the appreciation of supranationalstructures is more widespread than in the past. We discardthe simplistic visions of pure internationalism  but weuphold the validity  of the entities that are active todayalongside or above State sovereignty. The vitality of theAndean Common Market  the Southern Cone CommonMarket (MERCOSUR) and the European Union shows usa future of common and vigorous legal internationalarrangements. We are facing the definitive crisis ofnationalism  if not of full legal competence of the nationState. International law today appears as the onlyframework of standards with which to face the newrealities.There can be no doubt that the nuclear reality was oneof the factors that transformed the traditional concept of thenation State. The ability to foresee its results has made thedecision to accept war more exceptional  and non-atomicarmies have adhered to broader  supranational militaryorganizations. Atomic weapons have abolished theimpermeability of the nation State.We are likewise faced with a crisis of the veryconcept of borders. Traditionally  empires thought ofthemselves only in terms of being an extension of theirborders. Today borders are not an obstacle to integration.However  this does not imply that we are building auniversal State  a global “cosmocracy”. There are naturallimits to the territorial applicability of laws  and it is truethat the concentration of power has unbreachable limits beyond which it cannot go. Accordingly  history has so farnot led us to a universal State  but rather to a freerstructure  a complex political pluralism with a commongeneral foundation of representative democracy  individualliberties and economic freedom. We are facing new functionally limited supra-statal powers  with differentarrangements that differ in scope and intensity and that aresuperimposed upon the system of State borders.The modern theory of the State forged byMachiavelli and Bodin  the concept of the State as anabsolute power that excludes any other power  is todayfading. For more than 20 years States have recognizedforces superior to themselves. The idea of the unlimitedsovereign State has broken down; the linchpin of thewhole theory of the modern State has broken down.Today sovereignty continues to exist  but not as unlimitedpolitical power  but rather as full constitutional legalcompetence. That seventeenth-century concept thatinspired the Peace of Westphalia  cuius regio eius religio— that each State should have a religion — has been leftbehind. This is more apparent than ever at the end of thecold war  when the secular beliefs that confronted theworld have been discarded. Today the cohesion of humansocieties is governed by universal concepts.The new reality leads us to assert that Statesovereignty has already been made subject to internationallaw — and  it can be said  to natural law — thus negatingthe theoretical legitimacy of the State that was born withthe modern age. This in no way means that there is nolonger a need for patriotism  the concept of fatherland ornational histories. It means  instead  that the myth of thenationalist State has collapsed.In a truly human breakthrough and not a purelytechnological one  all moral values today are reduced totheir personal roots. Today  neither Governments nor thegoverned can shirk the ethical imperatives that ruleequally over their public and private conduct. This is dueboth to the process just outlined and to a wholly new andfar-reaching technological revolution in masscommunications.The law of nations was at first a principle ofcommercial intercourse. It later came to apply to only onekind of actor: the nation State. Today  an open functionalregionalism is bringing about far-reaching changes thatare swiftly altering the existing order  and the UnitedNations would be ill-advised to disregard that new realityin strengthening the Security Council and reforming itsinstitutions.This is the cornerstone upon which the UnitedNations should be re-founded  now that the circumstancesof power which governed its life at the close of theSecond World War and during the cold war have beenovercome. We should not lose sight of the fact that although the act of consent that forged this new  open functional regionalism was the work of the nation State today that regionalism is already a supranational reality14that has taken on a life of its own and is spreading aroundthe world. Inter-statal balances of power are giving way toregional balances of power that are not concentrated in asingle focal point of power and that are more decentralizedand more rational.The future will be one in which an internationalsystem with freer and more flexible structures will be basedon the freedom of man as an individual  as a person. Thisobliges States  within the framework of the United Nationssystem  to go beyond their traditional activities and jointlyengage in management activities in the Organization basedon the new cultural  economic and geographical realitymade up of broad functional regional areas. I say onceagain: this is the keystone of the foundation of the newedifice of the United Nations.I have come here to reiterate the commitment of Peruand of the Peruvian people to the United Nations  but alsoto warn that the new realities that must not be ignored.Those realities have guided the policy of President AlbertoFujimori and are the inspiration for his Government’sfar-reaching and successful reform. Peru  in its continentalrelations  today bases its foreign policy upon the principlesof open functional regionalism and strives to link thePacific with the Atlantic through supranationalarrangements.Rooted in its rich Latin-American heritage  my countrysees its future in continental terms  drawing upon LatinAmerica’s important contribution in the area of integration international law and mechanisms for peace and security.Accordingly  we are convinced that organizational changesin the United Nations should be based on those sameprinciples."
"133",5580,"PHL",51,1996,"﻿On behalf of my delegation Sir  I take pleasure in extending to you our heartfeltfelicitations on your election to the presidency of theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-first session. We in thePhilippines and in the Association of South-East AsianNations (ASEAN) derive special gratification fromcongratulating you  a citizen of an ASEAN country  on thisgreat honour.The Philippines pays tribute to Secretary-GeneralBoutros Boutros-Ghali  who has led our Organization in themost difficult circumstances.I must beg your indulgence  Mr. President  and that ofour colleagues to speak briefly about recent events in mycountry  developments which we consider historic  openinga bright new chapter in the history of the Philippines.Exactly a month ago  on 2 September  the PhilippineGovernment and the Moro National Liberation Front(MNLF)  which had waged a rebellion for more than aquarter of a century  signed an agreement ending theconflict in Mindanao and establishing a zone of peace anddevelopment in that island-region.On 9 September  Professor Nur Misuari  leader ofthe MNLF  ran for and was elected to the office ofGovernor of the Autonomous Region of MuslimMindanao  which is  by virtue of a plebiscite  composedof four provinces in which Muslim Filipinos are in themajority.At the same time  in accordance with the 2September agreement  the Southern Philippines Councilfor Peace and Development is being organized under theleadership of the MNLF to help promote peace anddevelopment in 14 provinces and nine cities in thesouthern Philippines. Thus has the Philippines opted fornational reconciliation as the only true road to peace anddevelopment.Here  I pay tribute and give thanks to theOrganization of the Islamic Conference (OIC)  and to theOIC’s Committee of Six on the Situation of the Muslimsin the Southern Philippines  under the wise and vigorousleadership of Indonesia and with the especially activeinvolvement of Libya  for guiding us along that roadtowards the goal which we have now achieved.I mention this because I know that what isessentially a domestic development in the Philippinesfinds resonance in other places and in the world at large.We all know only too well that conflicts arisingfrom ethnic and cultural differences are not unique to thePhilippines. But just as the Mindanao conflict was notunique  neither was the process of reconciliation thatended it. We consider the settlement in Mindanao areflection of the salutary trend towards peace andreconciliation in the world  as well as a modest contributionto it.In South Africa  the racist abomination that wasapartheid has been abolished  and a multiracial Governmentbased on the rule of the majority and the rights of theminority has been put in place  lending new stability tosouthern Africa.In the Middle East  nations in contention agreed totake the road of peace. Regrettably  recent events haveshown that the road is still strewn with obstacles. We retainthe faith that these obstacles are surmountable with goodwill and a firm conviction that peace must not be destroyedagain in a land so revered by people of many faiths. Ourmost fervent prayers go to the leaders and nations involvedthat they may soon return to the path of mutualunderstanding  reconciliation  justice and peace  for both thePalestinian and the Israeli peoples.In Bosnia and Herzegovina  we can at least hope thatthe Dayton accords  as well as the 14 September andsubsequent elections  will put behind us the singular horrorof “ethnic cleansing” and lead to a situation where differentethnic groups can live once again in peace and tolerance.In this hemisphere  the Government of Guatemala andarmed dissidents have achieved an accord of security andjustice.In our own region of South-East Asia  we lookforward to the completion of a new Constitution byMyanmar that will provide a place in the nation’s politicallife for the nationalities that have for so long been inrebellion and for political groups of many persuasions.Unfortunately  inter-ethnic conflicts in far too manyplaces continue to inflict suffering on innocent people —notably  for example  in Rwanda and Burundi.Around the world  simmering beneath the surface  aregrievances arising from growing disparities in economicwell-being and social status within States and nations.However  on a global scale  there is a clear trend towardsreconciliation and tolerance. As it is within nations  so is itbetween nations. We may be witnessing a new era  one notonly of relative peace but also of close cooperation indealing with the global challenges of today.The cold war has ended  and with it the deadlyreality of armed confrontation between nuclear-armedblocs.Even the old North-South economic divide is beingsubsumed in a new global trading regime and in regionaleconomic arrangements  such as the Asia-PacificEconomic Cooperation  in which the interests of bothdeveloped and developing countries are taken intoaccount. These developments in reconciliation andcooperation give us hope that mankind can find the willto work together in meeting the old and new challengesthat confront the world as a whole.I see six major challenges that are central to thefuture welfare and the very survival of mankind.The first has to do with the surfeit of weapons thatcontinues to plague the world  particularly the continueddeployment and development of nuclear arms and otherweapons of mass destruction  the expanding volume ofthe traffic in conventional arms and the continuedproduction and persistent use of especially injuriousdevices of war.The second lies in the potential for conflict overmaritime jurisdictions and resources and the need forstable maritime regimes. Another is mankind’s continuingassault on the environment  putting into question thesustainability of the world’s development. Yet anotherchallenge is the need to maintain the momentum of theliberalization of international trade while cushioningweaker nations and vulnerable sectors of society from itsundesirable effects. The fifth challenge is the necessity ofensuring human welfare and dignity within the nation-State and within society. The sixth and last is the growingmenace of organized criminal gangs purveying terror deadly weapons  illicit drugs  indentured labour  and thebodies of our women and children across internationalborders.We have made significant progress in the control ofarms; but the world remains a dangerous place  and muchwork remains to be done. We have extended indefinitelythe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons(NPT). Many of us have signed the ComprehensiveNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty that the General Assemblyadopted last month. But we should not stop there  forthese are but steps on the road towards complete nucleardisarmament. We continue to call upon the nuclear-weapon States to take seriously their commitment under2Article VI of the NPT to negotiate in good faith theabolition of nuclear weapons.Towards this end  the Philippines once more joins thecall for the parties to the NPT to draw up an internationalconvention prohibiting the use and threat of use of nuclearweapons. As another step  we reiterate the call for theconclusion of an international convention against theproduction and stockpiling of fissile materials.Sir  last December in Bangkok  your Prime Ministerand my President  together with the Heads of Governmentof the eight other countries of South-East Asia  signed theSouth east Asia Nuclear Weapon-Free Zone Treaty. Weurge the nuclear-weapon States to commit themselves torespect this Treaty’s provisions by adhering to its protocol.Together with the Treaty for the Prohibition of NuclearWeapons in Latin America and the Caribbean (Treaty ofTlatelolco)  the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty(Treaty of Rarotonga)  the Pelindaba Text of the AfricanNuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty  and that for Antarctica the South-East Asian Treaty is a major step towards asouthern hemisphere free of nuclear weapons. We supportthe political linkage among these nuclear-free zones  as wasrecently proposed.Of particular concern to us is the unacceptably largenumber of innocent persons  including a disproportionatenumber of young children  killed or maimed by landmines.The Philippines has ratified the Convention and its Protocolrestricting the use of excessively injurious weapons landmines  booby traps and similar devices. We have joinedthe move towards a global ban on anti-personnel mines.In this spirit  President Ramos while on a visit lastDecember to Cambodia  a country ravaged by landmines ordered the immediate destruction of the Claymore mineswhich were then still in the inventory of the armed forcesof the Philippines. Compliance with the President’sinstructions has been completed.Another potential threat to global and regional peaceand security has been the developing scramble forjurisdiction  resources and strategic position in the world’soceans. This has been strongly evident in the situation inthe South China Sea  which for the most part is surroundedby South-East Asian States.Fortunately  the international community has had thecollective wisdom to agree on a set of rules  primarily inthe United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea  togovern the use of the sea. Not least  the Conventionsubjects maritime jurisdictions to the rule of law  definingthe nature and limits of those jurisdictions and providingthe legal framework for their establishment and fornegotiating settlements where they overlap.The world is threatened not only by weapons of warand by disputes over territory  but also by mankind’sassault on the world’s fragile environment. ThePhilippines is firmly committed to the protection of theenvironment within its national jurisdiction.Environmental protection is a vital consideration in theapproval of major development projects. We shallconserve the ecological integrity of the Philippinesexclusive economic zone as well as of its internal waters.As an archipelagic country whose exclusive economiczone extends to a portion of the South China Sea  thePhilippines places particular importance on preserving theecological integrity of that body of water  and wouldwelcome the sharing of knowledge and experience gainedfrom efforts to protect the environment in similar bodiesof water elsewhere in the world.A potential threat to the environment arises from thegrowing use of nuclear energy in the generation ofelectricity. This growth has been particularly rapid in EastAsia  producing nuclear waste with correspondingrapidity. While nuclear power is relatively clean as asource of energy  accidents in the operation of nuclearplants and in the disposal of nuclear waste can causedevastation for the environment as well as for humanlives. Equally damaging is the reckless manner in whichdecommissioned nuclear power plants and nuclear-powered vessels are discarded. It is time for theinternational community to address this burgeoningproblem with the seriousness and urgency that it deserves.Last May  President Ramos proposed the possibleorganization of ASIATOM  an international body to lookinto this concern in East Asia and to devise measures todeal with it.Along with the breakup of empires  the dissolutionof hostile alliances  and the spread of the spirit ofreconciliation within and between nations  one salutaryglobal development in recent years has been theestablishment of an international trading regime based onthe increasingly free exchange of goods and services. Thisdevelopment was made possible by the embrace by nearlyall the world of market forces as the most efficient wayof creating wealth for the world’s people.The efficacy of this principle of internationaleconomic relations has been demonstrated in South-East3Asia  where countries have opened up their markets to oneanother  through the Free Trade Area of the Association ofSouth-East Asian Nations  and to the world for the benefitof all. Next month the Philippines will have the honour ofhosting the annual meeting of the Asia-Pacific EconomicCooperation Council (APEC)  including an informalmeeting of leaders of the 18 participating economies on thePacific rim.At that meeting  we will consolidate plans ofindividual APEC economies into a coherent Manila actionplan for APEC that will free up and ease trade  and thatwill attain the target set for free trade by the year 2010 forthe developed participants and by 2020 for the developingeconomies. The plan includes ways of engaging ineconomic and technical cooperation  particularly in order tohelp the less developed economies to adjust to the free-trade regime envisioned in APEC.A few weeks after the APEC meeting  the firstMinisterial Meeting of the World Trade Organization  to beheld in Singapore  will review the implementation of theUruguay Round agreements and seek to develop a workprogramme to sustain the momentum of global tradeliberalization through further negotiations on specificsectors.The Philippines is strongly committed to the openingup of its economy. In affirming this basic policy of ourcountry  we must ask our economic partners  particularlythe developed ones  to desist from circumventing their owncommitments to a free international trading regime byproviding subsidies to their uncompetitive sectors and byextending them protection in the guise of labour rights orenvironmental conservation. We must reject this kind oftactic.We must also urge that the subject and object ofdevelopment — human beings  their welfare and dignity —not be overlooked. We also believe that the status ofwomen is central to both economic growth and humandevelopment. The Philippines therefore calls upon all of usto carry out effectively and in full the Platform of Actionadopted by the Fourth World Conference on Women and todevote adequate resources to make this possible.In accordance with our convictions on the status andrights of women  validated at the Beijing conference  thePhilippines has actively pressed for international action tocombat those scourges that plague the human race: violenceagainst women and trafficking in women and children.Because of the international dimension of these blights onthe human condition  the United Nations and theinternational community must keep them high on theinternational agenda until the human race is freed ofthem. The Philippines and other countries similarlysituated have a special concern for women migrantworkers because of their peculiar vulnerability to violenceand abuse.The Philippines’ stand on the rights of women andchildren rests on our people’s deep conviction of theinherent sacredness of the rights of all human persons families and communities everywhere on this planet —their rights to freedom  dignity  participation in their owngovernance and to development.Our lives  our well-being and our rights areconstantly threatened by the activities of transnationalcriminal gangs. Some of these gangs traffic in drugs.Some steal and smuggle cars. Some deal in the illicitbuying and selling of arms. Others engage in terror for avariety of causes. Still others traffic in women  children or people eager for work.The Philippines is prepared to consider the draftconvention proposed by Poland on measures to combatorganized crime. We commend Poland for this timelyinitiative.The United Nations is the keystone of mankind’sefforts on behalf of disarmament  the rule of law in theworld’s oceans  the preservation of the Earth and itsenvironment  economic and social development  the fightagainst organized crime  and the protection of humanrights. Because of its central and growing importance inhuman affairs  the Philippines firmly believes that theUnited Nations must be constantly renewed andinvigorated to enable it to respond to the challenges thatface each generation.The Philippines favours the enlargement of theSecurity Council’s permanent membership through theaddition of countries that are politically and economicallyable and willing to assume the responsibilities of suchmembership. At the same time  we believe in greaterrepresentation on the basis of equitable geographicaldistribution. The various innovative proposals now on thetable deserve close examination. But the issue ofmembership cannot be considered in isolation; it has to beaddressed in the context of reform of the SecurityCouncil — reform towards greater transparency anddemocracy of its working methods and reform towards amore balanced relationship with the General Assembly 4which must retain pre-eminence in the affairs of the UnitedNations.However  no structural changes in the United Nationswill be effective unless it is assured of the necessary flowof financial resources. Our Organization  no matter howmuch reform takes place  can function effectively only if itknows with reasonable certainty whether and when it canpay its staff and meet the other obligations arising fromoperations that  after all  are mandated  often unanimously by the Member States themselves.Simple mathematical calculations will demonstrate thatthe financial crisis of the United Nations cannot be easedunless we all comply with the financial obligations that wefreely undertook. We must pay our dues in full  on timeand without conditions. Specifically  the United Nations canrest on fairly stable financial foundations if all of us payour contributions to the regular budget for each year by theend of January of that year.The Philippines favours a revision of the scale ofassessments for United Nations contributions so as toreflect current political and economic circumstances.However  logic and consistency dictate that similaradjustments be made in the shares of the countries affectedin the capitalization of the international financialinstitutions  including the World Bank and regionaldevelopment banks such as the Asian Development Bank.The world’s peace  stability and progress  and thewelfare and dignity of its inhabitants  depend in largemeasure on the United Nations — not on the Secretary-General or the Secretariat alone. Although their role iscrucial  they depend above all on us  the Member States which  together with our peoples  make up the UnitedNations. We are the United Nations. Let us make it work."
"134",5601,"PLW",51,1996,"﻿It is my distinct honour toaddress the United Nations during this historic session which I am confident will be remembered for all time forits adoption of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-BanTreaty.20The Republic of Palau applauds and thanks thosecountries that will be signatories to the Treaty  for webelieve that it does much to advance our goal of ridding theplanet of nuclear weapons. The Treaty  by banning furthertesting  will help prevent the development of moredangerous nuclear weapons. Furthermore  the Treaty willhelp prevent other nations from obtaining existing nuclearweapons. The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty thusclearly helps to make the world a safer place for us and forall of our children.The Republic of Palau’s commitment against thecreation and proliferation of nuclear weapons is long-lastingand resolute. When the people of Palau adopted ourConstitution in 1978  we became the first country in theworld to become a constitutionally mandated nuclear-freecountry. Indeed  protecting our citizens from these horrificweapons of destruction is at the very heart and soul of ourConstitution.While not every country will sign the Treaty  the factthat the world’s five recognized nuclear Powers — theUnited States  China  France  Russia and the UnitedKingdom — have agreed to abide by the terms of theTreaty and that the overwhelming majority of other nations including the Republic of Palau  have also agreed to abideby its terms gives the citizens of my country and of everyother nation on Earth the hope that one day we will be freefrom these catastrophic weapons of destruction and of thethreat they pose to each of us and to our globalenvironment.Accordingly  I would like to thank all of those whohelped bring the citizens of the world this Treaty  includingthe Chairman of the Ad Hoc Committee on a Nuclear TestBan  Ambassador Ramaker of the Netherlands  andespecially our close neighbour and great friend  theGovernment of Australia  which took the lead at the UnitedNations in making this Treaty a reality.Another of my nation’s primary concerns is the issueof how to protect the environment while providingsustainable economic development. This is a central issuefor small island nations in particular and for otherdeveloping countries around the world. The Republic ofPalau is therefore very pleased by the recognition andaffirmation that human beings are at the centre ofsustainable development and that they have the right to ahealthy  productive and meaningful life in harmony withnature.However  to make sure that this affirmation becomesa reality  action must be taken at all levels of government in particular at the international level. To help everynation achieve this goal  developing countries  includingsmall island nations  must be provided the necessaryresources to enable them to implement the decisions andrecommendations of the United Nations Conference onEnvironment and Development  the Global Conference onthe Sustainable Development of Small Island DevelopingStates and other significant international conferences.The Republic of Palau  a small island nation in thePacific  cherishes its recognition as an independentcountry and greatly values its membership in the UnitedNations  which allows our voice to be heard on globalissues such as the importance of freeing the world ofnuclear weapons and protecting our global environment.We believe that perhaps the most critically important roleof the United Nations is to provide a forum for nationslarge and small to discuss  debate and reach agreement onhow best to serve economic  social  cultural and otherhumanitarian problems. Consequently  we believe thatthose countries which have made demonstrated efforts toadvance regional and global peace  security and prosperityby establishing partnerships with other countries to furtherthese causes have much to offer the United Nations as awhole and to its constituent Members individually.In his inaugural speech to his country  United StatesPresident Bill Clinton pointed out that it is very likelythat every problem we face has already been solvedsomewhere in the world. The challenge for us all is tocommunicate with each other so that we can discoverthose solutions. The United Nations clearly provides theforum for such dialogue and discovery to take place. TheRepublic of Palau believes that a greater number ofvoices invited to participate in these discussions can onlylead to better solutions to the myriad global problems weall face.The overwhelming support given to theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty aptlydemonstrates that  through many people working together the cacophony of historically divergent voices can beharmonized for the benefit of all the peoples of all thenations on Earth."
"135",5640,"PNG",51,1996,"﻿On behalf ofthe people and the Government of Papua New Guinea  Icongratulate you  Mr. President  on your election to presideover the General Assembly at its fifty-first session. Thewarm relations that have developed between our twonations make it a particular pleasure to welcome you toyour high office and to wish you well in carrying outyour duties. I would also like to record our sincereappreciation for the wise leadership with which yourpredecessor guided our deliberations during the historicfiftieth session of the General Assembly.The rapid approach of the year 2000 raises thequestion whether — and how — we are going to try tomake the turn of the century a turning point for theUnited Nations. Despite the many thought-provokingspeeches made for the fiftieth anniversary  I regret to saythat signs of fundamental and far-reaching changesrequired remain elusive. Yet we live at a time when theonly constant factor is change. The preamble to itsCharter makes it quite clear that the United Nations itselfwas — and is — intended to be an agent of change. Ifour Organization is to remain relevant to the challengesahead  then it  and we the Members  must adapt and keepon adapting  as the world continues to change.Invented to raise humanity’s sights beyond thehorizon of destruction caused by world war  the UnitedNations must be continuously reinvented in order to playan effective role in a rapidly changing world. The UnitedNations has in fact been successful at one kind of change:adding to our agenda responsibilities and activities inareas such as peacekeeping  peacemaking  human rightsand sustainable development. It has  however  been verymuch less successful in rationalizing its operations andadministrative support.Humanity needs a much more focused  trim and vitalUnited Nations. Without internal reform  the risk ofoverload is only too real — and  arguably  overload isalready here. Even more importantly  we  the Members ofthe United Nations  have to do more  much more  toadapt key institutions to the changed and still-changingcircumstances of a post-colonial  post-cold-war world.Almost everyone agrees what the main issues andoptions are. Yet as far as its permanent membership goes the Security Council in particular remains  much as it hasalways been  the product of decisions made before mostMember States became independent. Some of thestrongest critics of the cost and alleged inefficienciesof the United Nations come from States that are amongthe slowest in paying their membership dues. Whilethey criticize weaknesses in the Organization’sperformance  they are often among the most eager4advocates of giving it new assignments. Theiractions — and inaction — suggest that they confusecutbacks in the resources available to the United Nationswith real reform.Like other members of the Non-Aligned Movement Papua New Guinea is firmly committed to reforming theSecurity Council. While we recognize that those whomexisting arrangements most favour are well placed to delayor block change  we firmly believe that the Council’scomposition should be altered. It must take better accountof the geographical distribution and sovereign equality ofMember States. Concerned that it seems to be taking longerto reform than it originally took to form the United Nations Papua New Guinea’s voice and vote are emphatically forchange. We believe that the time for action is now.Papua New Guinea has embarked on an ambitiousprogramme of domestic reforms  including bothconstitutional and economic-policy changes. Havinglegislated a new system of provincial and local-levelgovernments in order to improve the delivery of services toour people  we are actively engaged in implementation.Twenty-one years after giving ourselves a “home-grown”Constitution  we are now engaged in a comprehensiveprocess of reform that is equally “home-grown”.My Government is just as determined to bring aboutcomprehensive structural adjustment. Following decisionsto devalue and float our national currency  the kina  we arenow reducing the size of the public sector. We are makingthe official interface with the private sector morebusiness-friendly and encouraging commercial enterprise.While international agencies and foreign aid donors providevaluable support  the impulse  direction and pace of reformare emphatically Papua New Guinea’s own. Being amember of the Government that led Papua New Guinea toits independence  I cannot allow our national sovereignty —or our Government’s ability to respond to our people’sneeds — to be compromised now.Experience of the difficulties of reform at home hasreinforced my Government’s commitment to reforming theUnited Nations. The principles remain the same. Westrongly support efforts to ensure that the world has a trulyeffective  flexible and responsive Organization throughwhich to cooperate in meeting the challenges of the twenty-first century.The United Nations is founded on the idea thatsecurity involves much more than military defence againstthreats of armed attack. Conscious of the threats andlimitations on self-defence that we face together withother small island developing countries  Papua NewGuinea has always regarded collective security as animportant key to national security. Diplomacy is themeans by which we seek to cooperate with all otherStates committed to peace.As the current Chairman of the MelanesianSpearhead Group (MSG)  I am pleased to report that wewelcomed Fiji as a new member at our Summit in June.We also adopted a document — “Melanesia Beyond2000” — which outlines our objectives and strategy forthe MSG’s second decade.We have emphasized our commitment to cooperationon a wide basis and have also agreed to a proposal onweapons control. The South Pacific Forum is developingthe idea on a region-wide basis. Following the extremeoutrage that the South Pacific felt when France resumedits testing programme in French Polynesia last year  I cannow report that the programme has ceased. The remainingnuclear Powers with interests in our region — France  theUnited Kingdom and the United States of America —have signed the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty(Treaty of Rarotonga). France has been readmitted as apost-Forum dialogue partner.As much as we welcome the developments duringthe past 12 months  Papua New Guinea believes thatmore is required before our region can be described asgenuinely nuclear-free. Outstanding needs include abroader treaty  systematic monitoring of former test-sites cleaning up  compensation and the provision of alternativesources of income for the people of French Polynesia.The Treaty of Rarotonga is complemented by theMSG’s Lakatoro Declaration on Denuclearization inOceania. Subregional and regional efforts are againcomplemented by similar arrangements negotiated duringthe past year in South-East Asia and Africa  as well as bythe much older arrangements that apply to Antarctica andLatin America. Papua New Guinea welcomes theBrazilian proposal to link these arrangements into acomprehensive nuclear-weapon-free zone covering theentire southern hemisphere. Having supported the recentpassage of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty we would now like to see it extended to outlawingsimulations  limiting the development and acquisition ofnew nuclear weapons and  ultimately  bringing aboutcomplete disarmament.5The South Pacific Forum has expressed support for theearly conclusion of negotiations over a legal regimecovering civil liability for nuclear damage.Committed to furthering cooperation against threats toour region  the South Pacific Forum is working on anarrangement through which member States can respond tolegitimate requests for assistance from one another’sdisciplined services  including police. The samearrangement could also be used for consultations intendedto help prevent  manage and settle disputes. We continue tobroaden  deepen and diversify other areas of securitycooperation  including law enforcement.Consistent with agreements reached at the regionallevel  Papua New Guinea has adopted a comprehensivecode of logging practice designed to promote thesustainable use and in-country processing of a richrenewable natural resource.We are gravely concerned at the threat that climatechange poses to the very survival of low-lying atolls. Entirecountries in our region face the risk of extinction. PapuaNew Guinea joins with other developing countries in callingon the advanced industrialized countries to look beyondtheir immediate self-interest and adopt specific targets forreducing greenhouse emissions  an issue which generatesconsiderable emotion among us.Together with other coastal States in the region  welook to distant-water fishing nations for cooperation ingiving effect to the United Nations Agreement on straddlingfish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks so that it doesnot weaken existing regional arrangements.In the wider Asia-Pacific region  Papua New Guineacalls for a reduction of avoidable sources of stress uncertainty and risk on the Korean Peninsula  both for thesake of the countries directly involved and because of theirpotentially adverse effects on other countries.Concerned about events earlier in the year  I repeatlast year’s call for the United Nations to do its best to easethe tensions between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.Important regional organizations in the Asia-Pacific havefound ways of following the principle within the region.The European Parliament has adopted a resolutionrecommending that the United Nations identify options forTaiwan to take part in the activities of bodies answerable tothe General Assembly. The United Nations has anobligation to assist in maintaining a secure environment inwhich economic growth and other forms of developmentcan continue for the benefit of the peoples of the regionas well as their partners around the world. It is thereforetime to address the question of Taiwanese participation ininstitutions and processes set up to further the universalobjectives of the United Nations Charter.Respect for the national sovereignty of MemberStates is basic to the United Nations Charter. Small islanddeveloping countries tend to be especially vulnerable toa wide range of possible threats. Their development  andeven their very survival  often depend on internationalcooperation and law.Having achieved national independence under UnitedNations supervision  Papua New Guinea is firmlycommitted to the United Nations Special Committee onthe Situation With Regard to the Implementation of theDeclaration on the Granting of Independence to ColonialCountries and Peoples. Despite criticism from certainquarters  we were therefore pleased to welcome and hostthe Special Committee’s regional seminar held in PortMoresby in June. Together with all other members of theMelanesian Spearhead Group and the South PacificForum  we remain firmly committed to the orderlydecolonization of New Caledonia  with special safeguardsfor the indigenous Kanaks. We will not accept illegitimateattempts to delay or derail complete implementation ofthe Matignon Agreements. Having reviewed the FrenchGovernment’s record elsewhere in the region  we askourselves whether French Polynesia  as well as Walis andFutuna  should be included in the United Nations list ofNon-Self-Governing Territories. The internationalcommunity has a duty to see that France meets itsresponsibilities to the people of our region and a primeresponsibility must be the right of self-determination.On Bougainville  my Government is firmlycommitted to doing all that we can to resolve the crisisthat has racked the Bougainville Province in my countrysince 1989. I therefore negotiated a cease-fire  arrangeda regional peacekeeping force and agreed to peace talksin October 1994  only to find that the militant leaderswould not honour the agreements reached. Even so  myGovernment has been prepared to talk to those who willtalk to us. We have established the BougainvilleTransitional Government and continue to provideprotection for people forced to flee from their homes bythe criminal actions of an armed and militant minority.We continue to restore services and to encouragereconciliation  but the mounting toll of destruction  injuryand loss of life caused by the militants gave the National6Government no alternative but to lift the ceasefire on 21March this year.Even now  rival gangs of armed criminals continue tothreaten the lives of innocent people  trying to destroy whatthe people  provincial leaders and the national Governmentare doing and reconstructing. They undermine all efforts tomaintain the rule of law. In a particularly barbaric attack on8 September this year  12 members of our security forceswere killed at the Kangu Care Centre in SouthBougainville.Despite the worst efforts of the BougainvilleRevolutionary Army and its sympathizers abroad  myGovernment is standing firm. We will not give them thesatisfaction of departing from our basic objective ofrestoring peace and rebuilding all they have destroyed.We appreciate the understanding displayed by theUnited Nations Commission on Human Rights when itconsidered the Bougainville situation earlier this year. It hasalways been a complex domestic issue. In keeping with themutual respect for national sovereignty that is basic tointernational law  Papua New Guinea calls on all otherStates to refrain from statements and actions that sendmisleading signals to those who violate our laws; tocooperate in preventing smuggling and other illegalviolations of our borders; and generally to prevent outsidersfrom interfering illegally in Papua New Guinea’s internalaffairs. In so doing  we add the reminder that it is not theforeign meddlers who will suffer most from the effects ofthe crisis — it will be the people of Papua New Guinea including the overwhelming majority of Bougainvilleans who consider themselves to be part of our nation andentitled to the same rights as all other Papua NewGuineans.Conscious of the violations that have occurred on allsides and of the need to avoid any repetition  myGovernment is in the process of trying to strengthenexisting arrangements by establishing a national commissionon human rights.My Government has embarked on an ambitiousprogramme of structural adjustment  because we — and notsome outside body — think that we should in order toensure that development can be sustained for futuregenerations. While we accept external advice and appreciateexternal assistance  we have not yielded to  and will notgive in to  external pressure. It is crucial that the officialconduct of such bodies not raise basic questions aboutrelations between these institutions and the sovereignty ofthe member States that they are supposed to serve.National and collective self-reliance are both meansof achieving and integral to the objective of sustainabledevelopment. They are critical to maintaining andstrengthening the security and sovereignty of States.National self-reliance is among Papua New Guinea’sconstitutional goals and directive principles. Collectiveself-reliance through South Pacific cooperation is amongthe commitments contained in my Government’s PacificPlan and implemented through our current nationalbudget.My Government’s proposal that Papua New Guineashould enter into a form of permanent association withthe Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) isintended to further the process by which we cooperatewith neighbouring countries to promote collectiveself-reliance. We appreciate the positive interest thatASEAN members have expressed in the idea and westrongly support closer cooperation between ASEAN andthe South Pacific Forum.As the only Pacific island country directly involvedin the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Council(APEC)  but by no means the only such country likely tobe affected by the process  Papua New Guinea hasproposed that APEC set up a scheme to help buildcapacity among the 13 small island developing countriesin the region so that they are not left or pushed behind.The proposal that we are now developing in greaterdetail is emphatically not intended to be yet anotheropen-ended aid programme under a different name.Rather  it is intended to help small island countriesmanage their way through the transition to theachievement of APEC’s vision of open-ended regionalfree trade by the year 2020.As an active participant in institutions establishedunder the Lomé Convention  Papua New Guinea wouldlike to encourage other member States to give earlyconsideration to the kinds of changes that would facilitatedevelopment processes and objectives consistent withWorld Trade Organization rules.Conscious of the aid fatigue now spreading throughmany advanced industrial countries  we urge Governmentsand people of goodwill to recognize the time and effortthat development requires. With a few very honourableexceptions  donor countries have not reached — and in7many cases have fallen far behind — aid targets to whichthey agreed a generation ago.Thus  not only has aid been reduced  but recipients areeven more locked and tied to donors’ own preferences. Theeffect that the failure to honour commitments can have onnational forward planning can be very severe. It underlinesthe need for a reduced reliance on aid and for thedevelopment of a greater degree of self-reliance.In view of the vital role that the business sector canplay in mobilizing capital for investment and trade  wewelcome schemes designed to assist in the development ofthe private sector. We especially welcome the contributionsmade to such schemes by the advanced industrial countries.We cannot achieve all our reforms without the supportof world institutions. That is accepted. However  thoseinstitutions themselves need to operate with greaterflexibility and to be more sensitive to the particular needsof Governments to preserve democracy  the environmentand their people’s national identity and culture.My Government takes a global view of Papua NewGuinea’s foreign relations and of issues on the UnitedNations agenda. We encourage official agencies  businessand non-governmental organizations both to “Look North”and to “Work the Pacific” for mutual benefit with closeneighbours. Conscious that we must not overlooklongstanding friends  we give high priority to reinforcingcore relationships. Our overall objective is to continuereform at home in order to meet the challenges of globalchange.We will continue to support wider efforts at reform including those directed at and through the United Nations in order to meet the challenges of global change andembrace the imperatives of reform in readiness for thetwenty-first century."
"136",5686,"POL",51,1996,"﻿I am pleased to speak beforethe Assembly of this universal Organization  where virtuallyevery country in the world  small or vast  rich or poor  hasa voice  thus making democracy work in internationalrelations.At the outset  I should like warmly to congratulateyou  Sir  on your election to your honourable office. I notewith pleasure that your diplomatic career includes a term asAmbassador of Malaysia to my country. The delegation ofPoland will do its best to assist you in your importantfunctions. Let me also pay tribute to Mr. Diogo Freitas doAmaral  an eminent statesman from Portugal  for theexcellent manner in which he presided over the work of theAssembly during its fiftieth anniversary session. May Ialso express the assurance of my highest appreciation toSecretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali.As a representative of Poland  a country that hassuffered so much war  foreign occupation and partition inits history of more than 1 000 years  I feel entitled toconvey a simple message: peace is priceless  be itinternational  with other countries  or internal  amongsocial partners. To endure  peace needs solid economicfoundations  sustainable development and growth. Yetpeace remains a supreme value and a precondition of life rightly recognized from the outset as a principal objectiveof the United Nations.My country’s very recent experience shows that it ispossible to undertake a profound transformation of awhole political and economic structure  to defuse apotential internal conflict through peaceful negotiation.Having regained full national sovereignty  we were ableto reshape our foreign policy in accordance with thenational interest  to reorient it towards the Euro-Atlanticstructures and to establish and strengthen good-neighbourly relations with the newly created and/orprofoundly transformed States that now surround us. Isthere another country in the world which  in just a fewyears  has seen all of its neighbours  without exception change and not as a result of conflict? Sometimes we hearopinions on an alleged lack of stability in our region Central Europe. But it is not true. The case of Poland with its stabilizing influence in the region  tells quite adifferent story.I am proud to report to you  Mr. President  that wehave accomplished a lot in the last seven years. Not onlyhave we built a sound foundation for a new economic andpolitical system  but we have also succeeded in stoppingour economic decline and have achieved  now for the fourthyear in a row  a high rate of economic growth  which hasencouraged the media to add the Polish eagle to countriesnicknamed “economic tigers”. This has been achievedthrough an enormous effort on the part of our people  whohave proved mature enough to pay the price of economictransformation. We have opened up the economy and thecountry. Tens of millions of tourists are pouring in everyyear  and millions of Poles travel abroad in all directions.We have become an attractive place for foreign investment which exceeds $10 billion  and we are working on furtherimproving the conditions in which investment can thrive.It is not my intention to minimize the challenges westill face. Yet I strongly believe in our future. The time hascome for Poland  which received help and encouragementfrom so many countries during its “Solidarity” revolutionand its historic peaceful transformation based on a politicaland social contract  to offer its help to other countries thatundertake great processes of transformation. We can shareour experience  the services of our companies  and the workof our experts in various fields where transformation is amust. As an Organization for Economic Cooperation andDevelopment (OECD) member  Poland is determined tobecome much more involved than heretofore in assistingthe developing countries and those in transition.Our priority in terms of foreign policy is to join theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and theEuropean Union. While seeking these memberships  wetreasure friendly relations and multifaceted cooperation withour neighbours  Russia among them. At the same time Poland is fully conscious of its duty to carry its part of theobligations as a member of the world community  asmanifested by our active participation in the work of theUnited Nations and currently as a non-permanent memberof the Security Council. For many years  Poland hastraditionally been among the 10 States fielding the largestcontingents in United Nations peace-keeping operations.Permit me to make a personal remark. I made theappeal “Let Us Choose the Future” into the slogan for my1995 election campaign. May I suggest making thisappeal — choosing  and looking into  the future whilelearning from our common past — here in the UnitedNations? Old enmities and hatred  both among and withinStates  should no longer cast a shadow on the constructionof our common future.Let me give as an example Poland’s proposal todelete from the United Nations Charter the so-calledenemy States clause. Indeed  Poland now has close friendly relations with its long-time adversary  Germany.As a tribute to history  we plan to carry out soon jointmanoeuvres of German and Polish military units  and tocontemplate establishing a joint Blue Helmets brigadeconsisting of Polish and German soldiers. Would that notconstitute the best signum temporis possible?This Organization is in acute need of reform to adaptto the challenges of the next century. There is a pressingneed for the United Nations to confront the future. Itsduty remains to make its Member States aware of globalproblems as they arise  to analyse them  and to helpresolve them through multilateral cooperation. To makethis happen  much more is needed than the mererestructuring of its intergovernmental bodies and theSecretariat. Bolstering efficiency in carrying out UnitedNations tasks through rational downsizing where possibleand necessary is not the only major requirement. Moreimportantly  it is high time to adapt the United Nationswork programme through innovation and redeployment.For instance  in Poland’s view the United Nationsshould enhance and upgrade its potential in the field ofthe protection of human rights through the establishmentof a General Assembly committee on human rights andhumanitarian affairs  while merging the existing Secondand Third Committees into an economic and social one and through the elaboration by the Secretary-General ofan agenda on human rights. In addition  in a more long-term perspective  the creation of a new main body suchas a human rights council might be contemplated.The United Nations is expected to help parties inconflict to reach agreement and achieve a just peace. Butpeace-keeping forces are useless if there is no will forpeace in the hearts of fighters. It is necessary toencourage the easing of ethnic  religious and othertensions before they erupt  or if they already have  afterresolving the conflict. That is why it is vital to expandpreventive action  including diplomatic efforts and post-conflict peace-building as well as assistance forreconstruction and development. We are ready to offerour diplomats  international lawyers  and social andeconomic development experts for preventive UnitedNations missions and post-conflict assistance efforts.At the same time it seems essential to address thequestion of United Nations rapid reaction  including rapid-deployment potential  both in the headquarters and in the2field. We have notified the Secretary-General of our intentto make available for the rapid reaction component of thestand-by arrangements our special GROM (Thunder) force which proved itself in the Haiti operation. Poland considersit timely to re-focus the Organization’s attention onpreventive diplomacy and rapid-reaction capability. Toprevent as much as possible and react as quickly aspossible — this is what is increasingly needed incontemporary conflicts.Indeed  do we always have to helplessly witnessworldwide bloodshed and misery  so readily served up bythe media  and only afterwards try to help  when it is toolate and more costly  when more money brings less benefitand whereas an earlier joint action could have saved a lotof blood and tears for so many countries and peoples? Whydo we not ponder how to substitute a strategy of preventionand advance action for one of late reaction ex post facto?This strategy could go beyond a conservative doctrine ofthe maintenance of peace and security  covering a rapid andselective reaction to potential threats arising among andwithin Member States  as well as the consolidation of peacewhen it is painfully achieved.I turn now to the crucial issues of the post-cold-warera: disarmament  arms reduction and averting the spread ofarms through non-proliferation. Poland  which now holdsthe presidency of the Conference on Disarmament welcomed with great satisfaction the submission to theAssembly of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty and the adoption of the resolution  of which we wereamong the sponsors. We now look forward to the broadendorsement of the Treaty  which I had the privilege ofsigning this morning. We must not allow the arduousefforts of so many States to be wasted. While keeping inmind the need for eventual nuclear disarmament  partialsteps towards that goal should be given full approval asthey bring it closer and make the world safer  as would theentry into force of another important legal instrument: thechemical weapons Convention. Chemical weapons aresometimes called the nuclear bombs of the poor.Recent conflicts  however  have shown that massdestruction can also result from conventional arms  thestockpiles of which have grown enormously. That is whywe welcome the parallel focus on such arms  including so-called micro-disarmament  and an early total ban on the useof anti-personnel landmines.If the United Nations wants to remain meaningful inthe key areas of its mandate  to be ahead of events foreseeing and not merely reacting  slowly andinadequately  to what life brings with the astounding pacetypical of our times  it should grasp and cope with theinteractive relationship between peace  development andhuman rights protection.All these changes can have the desired effect only inconditions of sustained financing of programmedactivities. Political will is not enough. The currentfinancial crisis is propitious neither for the execution ofsuch activities nor for reform. To enable the Organizationto fulfil its statutory tasks and to reform  its financialcredibility needs to be restored. Member States should notdiscount innovative ideas for supplementary financing which could enable more activities to take place especially in support of developing countries  those intransition  and conflict-ridden countries. SinceGovernments are more often than not reluctant to increasetheir dues or their voluntary contributions  or to allow anyform of international taxation on their companies andcitizens  additional funds could be sought from the privatesector.For instance  the idea of a United Nations trust fundfinanced by tax-free donations  mainly from transnationalcorporations  could be examined. After all  stabilitycombined with economic growth and social peace alsobenefit such companies. Should their host Governmentscreate encouraging conditions for them to contribute  suchas common rules for tax reduction  the United Nationsmight acquire additional sources of funding  especially forhumanitarian and development support activities. Such asolution would in no way affect the governmentalcharacter of the Organization if control over the allocationof the newly acquired additional resources rested withGovernments  and if no conditionality could be introducedby donors.I would now like to draw the attention of theAssembly to what I consider one of the most importantaspects of my statement. I witnessed the terrorist attack atthe Olympic Games in Atlanta in July  and cannot forgetfaces expressing shock and tragedy.Poland is a country that has struggled over centuriesfor its own freedom and that of others. We have finallyachieved well-earned greatness and the benefits ofdemocracy. However  our nation is also paying a heavytoll for those benefits: open frontiers and increasedmigration of people pose threats to the security and well-being of my compatriots. Organized crime distorts theimage of democratic societies on a national  regional and3global plane. To combat it  we need the solidarity of allStates  and a concerted effort by all of us.The international community is faced with the growingthreat arising from seemingly unstoppable manifestations oftransnational organized crime and international terrorism which menace both the material and institutionalfoundations of our societies. What is especially dangerousfor us and for future generations is that in so many caseswe have been unable to bring criminals to justice. Justicehas been neither done nor seen to be done.I have received reports that my own country  and thewhole region  faces a steep increase in drug trafficking slavery  trade in child sex  and money laundering.Organized crime is a worldwide phenomenon. It bringstragedy and suffering to many — the immediate victimsand other innocent people. But it does more: organizedcrime leads to the creation of illegal associations andbusinesses that infiltrate and undermine legitimate economicinterests and political structures. Organized crime is like aform of corrosion in societies. Organized crime corruptsStates. Organized crime is a cancer in our communities  acancer that we should fight together. Alone  we risk losingthe battle and endangering our security.I am convinced that only a worldwide effort underUnited Nations auspices has any prospect of stopping thesecrimes  which threaten democratic freedoms and democracyitself. Poland believes  therefore  that the time has come tomake a concerted international effort to agree on  andaccede to a comprehensive legal instrument: a conventiondesigned to enhance cooperation between States andfacilitate the work of law enforcement agencies in fightingtransnational organized crime. I have the privilege to submitto this Assembly a draft framework convention againstorganized crime. It is annexed to the text of my statement which has been distributed to members.The Assembly will note that the draft convention dealswith illicit traffic in drugs and psychotropic substances andmoney laundering; traffic in persons; counterfeitingcurrency; illicit traffic in or stealing of cultural objects;stealing and smuggling nuclear material  and the misuse orthreat of misuse of such material to harm the public;terrorist acts; illicit traffic in or stealing of arms andexplosive materials or devices; illicit traffic in or stealing ofmotor vehicles; and corruption of public officials.The draft text proposes a system of cooperationbetween Member States to combat organized crime. It callsfor States either to punish offenders or to extradite them.We ask States to introduce criminal liability for peoplewho derive profits from organized crime  wherever suchliability is not already clear. We believe that we shouldmake United Nations agencies and regional and globalgovernmental and non-governmental organizations play agreater role in combatting organized crime.The draft framework convention is by no meanscarved in stone. We call on Member States to discuss andimprove the text. We hope that the Assembly willdetermine modalities to assure its speedy and successfulelaboration. I am sure that our common effort will help tosave our societies from the scourge of organized crime.Approaching the end of the century  the planet isvisibly in turmoil despite the otherwise universallywelcomed end of East-West confrontation and of theever-present threat of global conflict. Yet even in theheart of Europe  we are painfully aware of conflicts  wars tragedies  massive disasters  famine and serious economicdifficulties. People often expect the United Nations tooffer a miraculous remedy for all the evils of the worldand to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights  in thedignity and worth of the human person  and in the equalrights of men and women  and of nations large and small.If we just adhere to the Charter  the high roads willbe clear  not only for our time but for the coming century.We must not betray the high expectations held of theUnited Nations. For its part  Poland will not fail tocontinue to support the Organization. In today’sinterdependent world  we need a global body to settle ourdifferences and to ensure orderly global governance toavert threats to humanity. There is no point in reinventingthe wheel. We are able to adapt what we already have towhat we need now and in the years to come. In essence we are looking forward to a more united United Nationswhich has chosen the future. As an original MemberState  Poland stands prepared to contribute its share tomaking such an endeavour a reality."
"137",5712,"PRK",51,1996,"﻿I should like first of all  on behalf of thedelegation of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to congratulate Mr. Razali Ismail on his election asPresident. We are pleased that Malaysia  an Asiancountry  has assumed the presidency of the fifty-firstsession of the General Assembly. We believe that the richexperience he has gained in the course of dealing withinternational issues will crown the current session withgood results.I should also like to express my gratitude toMr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral of Portugal  the formerPresident  for his great contribution to the success of theprevious session of the General Assembly. Myappreciation also goes to the Secretary-General Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for his efforts devoted tostrengthening the United Nations.The building of a new world free from all forms ofdomination and subjugation  and aggression and war haslong been the common and cherished aspiration of theworld’s peoples. However  domination and subjugation and subordination and inequality still predominate ininternational relations — even today  after the end of thecold war — and this constitutes a great challenge to the20realization of world peace and security and thedemocratization of international society.Recent developments in the international arena areeloquent proof of the fact that every country should firmlymaintain its independence in order to safeguard its nationaldignity and rights and to build a free and prosperous world.For the Korean people  the last half-century has beena period of struggle and progress in their efforts toconsolidate and develop our style of socialism and toreunify the divided country despite all kinds of challengesand difficulties.Though caught in the vortex of the complex andfluctuating international situation surrounding the Koreanpeninsula  the Korean people have been able to marchforward continuously along the road to socialism — whichthey themselves chose — without any vacillation disappointment or vicissitude  despite the fact that on anuntrodden and poorly paved path  every step is difficult.This has been possible because they have firmly maintainedindependence in all domains of state-building on the basisof the Juche idea  the political philosophy of the Koreanpeople.The Juche idea  based on the philosophical principlethat man is the master of everything and decideseverything  regards the popular masses as the driving forceof the socio-historical movement  and identifies the people’sstruggle for independence  sovereignty and development asthe way to realize their independence. We have carried outour independent policy on the basis of the Juche idea relying on the strength of our own people. In internationalrelations  we have firmly adhered to the principle of notinfringing upon the sovereignty of others and of not havingour own sovereignty violated.At a time when international relations and the situationare becoming increasingly complicated  it becomes evermore important for a small country like ours firmly tomaintain an independent stand. The Juche philosophy created by the fatherly leader Comrade Kim Il Sung  thefounding father of our socialist Korea  and our independentpolicy  based on this philosophy  have been crediblyfollowed by the great leader Comrade Kim Jong Il. Thegreat leader Comrade Kim Jong Il has guided wisely all theaffairs of our Party  State and army for more than threedecades  and thus has consolidated and developed ourunique style of socialism into an indestructible one.The leader and the people are firmly united in oneidea and will  and the independent policy based on theJuche idea has deep roots in our territory. As a result there has been neither a political vacuum nor instabilityin our society  and our style of socialism is advancingvigorously  regardless of what others may say.It is the greatest fortune and happiness for ourpeople to have the respected Comrade Kim Jong Il  theoutstanding politician and iron-willed brilliantCommander  as the supreme leader of the Party and Stateand the Supreme Commander of the revolutionary armedforces. Under the wise leadership of the great leaderComrade Kim Jong Il  our people will make their countryprosperous and realize the fatherly leader's lifelongteachings on reunification  convinced of the victory of ourstyle of socialism.We hold that the question of national reunificationshould also be settled in the interests of the Korean nationin the context of the maintenance of international peaceand security  based on the specific conditions of ourcountry. In view of current realities in the North andSouth of Korea  characterized by different ideas andsystems  national reunification through confederation isthe only way to achieve a great national unityindependently and peacefully  on the principle of neitherside conquering or being conquered by the other. It isquite natural that the proposal for national reunificationthrough confederation set forth by Comrade Kim Il Sung the fatherly leader of our people  enjoys worldwidesupport.The pressing issue in the realization of nationalreunification through confederation on the Koreanpeninsula is the establishment of a new institutionalmechanism for easing tensions and ensuring peace andsecurity. Since the Armistice Agreement  signed in 1953 and the Military Armistice Commission  the executivebody of the Agreement  remain paralysed by unilateralmeasures on the part of the United States  theestablishment of a new peace arrangement is imperativein order to avert the danger of accidental conflicts  andfor the maintenance of security on the Korean peninsula.Accordingly  in April 1994 the Government of theDemocratic People's Republic of Korea advanced aproposal for the establishment of a new peacearrangement to replace the outdated system of Koreanarmistice in ensuring peace and security on the Koreanpeninsula. It also advanced in February of this year anepoch-making proposal to conclude an interim agreement21between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and theUnited States  a proposal that delineates in detail a newpeace arrangement that takes account of the United Statespolicy towards Korea and the present status of DemocraticPeople's Republic of Korea-United States bilateral relations.The interim agreement may include issues concerningthe management of the Military Demarcation Line andDemilitarized Zone; ways of addressing cases of armedconflict and accidents; the composition  duties and terms ofreference of a joint military body; and other issues relatedto the maintenance of security and order.The United States and South Korean authorities however  replied to our peace-loving proposal byaggravating tensions with large-scale war exercises and anarms build-up on the Korean peninsula. This situationurgently requires the establishment of a legitimate channelfor contacts between military personnel  with a view topreventing accidental armed conflicts and the recurrence ofwar. It is on the basis of this consideration that theDemocratic People's Republic of Korea proposed to theUnited States working negotiations for talks relating to theconclusion of the interim agreement  and the establishmentof an interim mechanism responsible for its implementation between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea andUnited States military authorities  the real parties to theKorean Armistice Agreement.There is no doubt that the conclusion of an interimagreement between the Democratic People's Republic ofKorea and the United States will constitute a breakthroughfor the negotiations on the signing of an agreement aimedat the maintenance of a durable peace  and it will  in turn eventually lead to the creation of an atmosphere favourablefor the implementation of the Agreement on Reconciliation Non-Aggression and Exchanges and Cooperation  betweenthe North and South  adopted by the North and South ofKorea.If the United States is truly interested in themaintenance of peace on the Korean peninsula  as itmentioned while proposing the “four-party talks”  it shouldbe willing to withdraw United States troops from SouthKorea. On the other hand  the United Nations should takeits own measures  without delay  to retrieve its name andflag from United States troops in South Korea  thus helpingto establish a new peace arrangement on the Koreanpeninsula.The existence of the United Nations Command inSouth Korea constitutes a legal obstacle to turning the stateof armistice into a durable peace and terminating the coldwar on the Korean peninsula. The United NationsCommand was not established by a United Nationsresolution. It is only a product of the cold-war era  whichcame into existence through the abuse of the name of theUnited Nations. The United Nations Command has movedtowards dissolution without any United Nationsresolutions during the post-war period  and consequentlyonly United States troops remain there today.This stark fact presents a vivid illustration of the factthat the “US-ROK Joint Command” is usurping thehelmets of United Nations forces and the name of theUnited Nations.In the past two years since the adoption of theDemocratic People's Republic of Korea-United StatesFramework Agreement  we have been sincerely fulfillingour obligations under the Agreement  as we have shownby freezing all of our nuclear facilities. For the fullimplementation of the Democratic People's Republic ofKorea-United States Framework Agreement  which isaimed at the fundamental resolution of the nuclear issueon the Korean peninsula  the United States should  amongother things  fulfil its obligations  including liftingeconomic sanctions against the Democratic People'sRepublic of Korea; and the present Democratic People'sRepublic of Korea-United States relationship ofconfrontation should be transformed into a relationshipbased on trust.There is also a need for several other countriespursuing unfriendly policies towards the DemocraticPeople's Republic of Korea to change their attitudes which would certainly be conducive to facilitating aresolution of the issue. We will make every effort toensure peace and security on the Korean peninsula and inthe region of North-East Asia.On this occasion  I wish to express my deepgratitude to the Governments of various countries  theaffiliated organs and specialized agencies of the UnitedNations system  including the Department ofHumanitarian Affairs  non-governmental organizations and individuals for their moral  material and humanitarianassistance and encouragement to our people  which havebeen provided in the hope of removing  as quickly aspossible  the damage caused in recent years by successivenatural disasters.In order to eliminate the legacies of the cold-warera  which has been negated by history  and to enable all22countries and nations to exercise their sovereignty on anequal footing  international society should be democratized.The United Nations should  first of all  be restructured intoa democratized Organization. The restructuring of theUnited Nations should be undertaken in a way that willfully represent the interests of developing countries  whichform the majority of United Nations Member States  andalso ensure the exercise of their sovereignty in the processof resolving major international issues.Only when the United Nations is restructured will it beable to do its part in the maintenance of international peaceand security and ensure democracy and impartiality in itsactivities. The priority for the democratization of the UnitedNations is to enhance the authority of the GeneralAssembly  the body in which all Member States arerepresented equally. We consider that issues relating tointernational peace and security should be brought directlyto the General Assembly for deliberation  and that a newsystem should be established to endorse Security Councilresolutions on the use of force  sanctions and peace-keepingoperations. Such measures would enable the SecurityCouncil to give full consideration to the interests ofMember States and thus prevent the adverse effects sufferedby many countries as a result of the implementation ofSecurity Council resolutions.The restructuring of the Security Council is the mostessential element in the democratization of the UnitedNations. There are a number of issues to be resolved inrestructuring the Security Council  and we consider itreasonable to proceed with the restructuring gradually based on the principle of first finding issues on whichagreement can be reached and achieving consensus on eachof them. From this viewpoint  we believe that consensusmay be reached on issues concerning the enlargement ofthe non-permanent membership of the Security Council andthe improvement of its working methods  both of whichhave already been agreed upon in principle by MemberStates.In this regard  our delegation considers that it ispossible for Member States to agree upon  above all  issuessuch as offsetting the imbalance in regional distributionthrough an increase of more than 10 seats in thenon-permanent membership of the Security Council  to beallocated among the regions of Asia  Africa and LatinAmerica  and through providing the countries concerned including the parties to disputes  with access to informalconsultations of the Security Council.Japan is taking advantage of the proposedenlargement of the permanent membership of the SecurityCouncil by attempting to become a permanent membereven though  as a defeated State of the Second WorldWar  it has failed to make an appropriate apology orprovide compensation for its war crimes but  instead  istrying to justify them after more than half a century haspassed. This makes a mockery of Member States particularly the Asian countries.Disarmament — especially nuclear disarmament —remains one of the most important problems for themaintenance of international peace and security. Webelieve that the nuclear-weapon States should providenegative security assurances to the non-nuclear-weaponStates  commit themselves to the non-use of nuclearweapons  and draw up and implement a timetable fortheir complete abolition.Despite the end of the cold war  regional  religiousand ethnic disputes are being further aggravated invarious parts of our planet  and consequently world peaceand security are gravely disturbed and peoples aresuffering from untold misfortunes resulting from them. Itis our consistent stand that disputes between countries andnations should be settled immediately through dialogueand negotiation in the interests of the parties concernedand in conformity with international peace and security.At present  the maintenance of peace and security inNorth-East Asia is one of the most vitally importantproblems. In order to ensure peace and security in North-East Asia  the arms race and any attempt aimed atfostering military collusion with outside forces should bebrought to an end. However  the military collusionbetween the United States and Japan is being intensified and furthermore  the United States  Japan and SouthKorea are becoming less disguised in their attempt tobuild up a tripartite military alliance by repeatedlylaunching joint military exercises in this region on thepretext of North Korea’s so-called invasion.In particular  the arms race is further acceleratedbecause the Japanese authorities are resorting to theunreasonable policy of trying to become a military super-Power  building up their arms and developing nuclearweapons. We strongly urge the Japanese authorities to endtheir confrontational acts against the Democratic People'sRepublic of Korea  including an arms build-up under theveil of an “immediate response in case of emergency”.23The question of social and economic development isdirectly linked with international peace and security  and itsresolution is therefore one of the important tasks before theUnited Nations. We hope that agreement will soon bereached on issues with regard to the implementation of thecommitment to official development assistance and thealleviation of external debt  thereby facilitating thecompletion of the Agenda for Development at the earliestpossible date in the Ad Hoc Open-Ended Working Groupon an Agenda for Development.We consider that reform of the United Nations in thefields of social and economic development should bedirected towards strengthening the agencies responsible fordevelopment cooperation under the United Nations system thereby contributing to accelerating the implementation ofthe declarations and action plans for the development ofdeveloping countries.The application of “selectivity”  which relatesdevelopment cooperation and technology transfer toquestions of “human rights” and “terrorism”  should nolonger be tolerated  and measures such as economicsanctions should be eliminated to ensure the economicdevelopment of Member States and regions.The Government of our Republic  which regards theman-centred Juche idea as its guiding idea  is providing allits people with political  economic and cultural rights andlegally protecting the lives and dignity of human beings.We reject the politicization of human rights  which abusesthe “question of human rights” in order to infringe uponthe sovereignty of other countries  and we oppose allforms of terrorism jeopardizing human lives  as well asany activities encouraging or assisting terrorist acts.Today  all justice-loving and peace-loving countriesand nations are making active efforts to establish a newworld order and equitable international economic relationsfor the twenty-first century. We express our appreciationto the Asian countries in their efforts to ensure peace andstability and to achieve common prosperity in theirregions. It is good that the Asia-Europe meeting  heldearly in 1996  agreed upon the strengthening of economiclinks and cooperation between the continents.We support the Arab and Syrian people in theireffort to strengthen unity and cooperation  and to achievea fair and comprehensive resolution of the Middle-Eastquestion  including the Palestinian issue  and we expresssolidarity with the Libyan people in their struggle todefend the sovereignty of their country.We appreciate the efforts of the Organization ofAfrican Unity to resolve social and economic issues anddisputes in the African region. We express solidarity withthe just cause of the Cuban people to lift the blockadeagainst Cuba  and  with the Latin American people intheir endeavours for peace and prosperity in their region.We will continue as before to develop relations offriendship and cooperation with all countries of the worldon the basis of ideas of independence  peace andfriendship and will endeavour to fulfil the obligationsentrusted to us in the achievement of the common causeof humankind for world peace and security under the wiseleadership of the great leader Comrade Kim Jong Il.The delegation of the Democratic People’s Republicof Korea will make sincere efforts towards the successfuloutcome of the debates on the agenda items before thissession of the General Assembly."
"138",5757,"PRT",51,1996,"﻿I should first like tocongratulate the President of the General Assembly on hiselection and to express our confidence in his capability toconduct the work of the current session. In congratulatinghim on his election  I am pleased by the fact that herepresents a country  Malaysia  with which Portugal hasexcellent relations in addition to deep historical and culturalties.I believe that it is understandable that I should alsotake this opportunity to pay tribute to the outgoingPresident  my fellow countryman Mr. Freitas do Amaral for the dedicated  competent and innovative manner inwhich he directed the work of the fiftieth session of theGeneral Assembly.I wish also to express to the Secretary-General myadmiration for the manner in which he has carried out hisfunctions during a period in which the United Nations hasbeen called upon to take an ever more active role in avariety of aspects of international life.My colleague from Ireland has already addressed theAssembly on behalf of the 15 member States of theEuropean Union  expressing positions to which Portugalfully subscribes. Nevertheless  I would like to reflect onsome questions that are of particular importance to mycountry.Allow me to point out that while speaking in mycapacity as Minister for Foreign Affairs of Portugal  I amalso speaking as a representative of a country that isextremely proud to belong to the Lusophone Community.This is probably the newest international organization  andas President of its Council of Ministers  I foresee animportant role for it in the concert of nations  in usefuland effective cooperation with the United Nations and itsagencies. It represents a strengthening of the solidarityand fraternity that unite these countries and will empowerthe economic and social development of its peoples  whileaffirming and disseminating the Portuguese language which is the common heritage of over 200 million peoplescattered over every continent.The Lusophone Community  made up of Angola Brazil  Cape Verde  Guinea-Bissau  Mozambique  SaoTome and Principe and Portugal  is a political projectbased on the Portuguese language  which is the historicbond and a common heritage of the seven countries despite geographical separation. It will always be an openforum  based on mutual support and close relationshipswith all Portuguese-speaking communities of the worldand cooperation with other  similar organizations.One year after the commemoration of the fiftiethanniversary  we are still far from meeting the expectationscreated and the real needs of the Organization. It is clearthat a process on this scale can be realized only in themedium term.A core issue of the reform process that we mustaddress is the resolution of the serious financial crisis ofthe United Nations. We believe that the resolution of thecrisis can be found through three essential approaches: thefulfilment of commitments  in full and on time; review ofthe scale of assessments in order to reflect the capacity ofMember States to pay; and financial rigour andrationalization of existing resources. In the spirit ofcontributing to the resolution of this crisis  Portugalvoluntarily increased its 1995 contributions to thepeacekeeping budget  moving from Group C to Group B19in the scale of assessments. That decision will result in afive-fold increase of our initial contribution.Equally important is the reform of the SecurityCouncil. We are convinced that only with an adequate andbalanced representation of all the world’s regions will theSecurity Council be more democratic and  consequently more effective in the formulation and implementation of itsdecisions.When considering the process of reform  I must alsorefer to issues related to the Agenda for Development andthe Agenda for Peace. With regard to the former  we mustrecognize the need to review the entire system ofinternational aid for development and consider the role theUnited Nations should play in this domain.The integrated and sustainable development wepropose should be pursued in all its facets  not only in theeconomic field  but also in the consolidation of democraticinstitutions. To meet these objectives  it will also benecessary to implement the decisions taken at the majorUnited Nations global conferences  as it has been at thoseconferences that the Agenda for Development has graduallytaken shape. This question is all the more important to usin Portugal  since we focus special attention on theNorth-South dialogue  which is attested to by the fact thatthe North-South Centre is located in Lisbon.Aware of the fact that today the important task in thisarea is to help the developing countries  especially the morevulnerable ones  Portugal has gradually increased the fundsit sets aside for development aid  both at the bilateral leveland through the framework of international organizations ofwhich it is a member. In this context  our officialdevelopment assistance exceeds the goal established fordonors at the Paris conference in 1990.At the multilateral level  allow me to single out theimportance we attribute to the Lomé Convention as a vitalinstrument of aid and cooperation between the members ofthe European Union and the countries of Africa  theCaribbean and the Pacific. Thus  we have stronglyadvocated a review of the Convention based on maintainingthe principles of partnership and cooperation.Maintaining international peace and securityundoubtedly continues to be the priority challenge faced bythe United Nations. The results achieved in most of therelevant missions lead us to conclude that we should notlessen our commitment or the dynamism of our activity.It is true that the United Nations cannot abdicate itsmission of helping to restore peace. We also believe however  that efforts should be focused on conflictprevention. But in both areas  the question of cooperationbetween the United Nations and regionalintergovernmental organizations has been discerninglyraised. This can be seen in some recent successfulexamples  such as the joint action of the United Nations the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)  theWestern European Union (WEU)  the Organization forSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and theEuropean Union (EU) in the territory of the formerYugoslavia  organizations of which Portugal is a memberand in which it participates actively.Another component of the efforts towards peace isdisarmament. Portugal welcomes the adoption of theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT).Portugal  which will contribute significantly to the CTBTverification system  has signed and will shortly ratify theTreaty  and appeals to all Member States of the UnitedNations to do the same.It is urgent that the process of enlarging theConference on Disarmament be completed  as well as thatof deliberating on its agenda and the rules for decision-making and for admission of new members  which shouldbe improved. It is increasingly essential to seriouslydebate nuclear disarmament  with a view to achieving theultimate goal of the permanent eradication of nuclearweapons. We advocate that the Conference onDisarmament should  early at its next session  beginnegotiations on a treaty for the banning of the productionof fissile material for nuclear weapons.With regard to the serious problem of anti-personnellandmines  Portugal hopes that concrete measures will betaken this year towards a complete prohibition of themanufacture and export of those devices of death anddestruction. For our part  we have already decreed amoratorium on the manufacture and export of suchweapons. Furthermore  I would like to mention that on 23August last my country ratified the Convention on thebanning of chemical weapons.Among the many activities of the United Nations  Iwould like to single out two areas which I consideressential: the environment and human rights.The protection of the environment is becoming anincreasingly prominent issue. In this field  we recognizethe great importance of the problems of climate change 20desertification and the protection of the marineenvironment. For this reason  Portugal has been closelyfollowing the implementation of the principles anddecisions adopted in this regard at major United Nationsconferences.I would also like to underline the particular sensitivityof Portugal  whose territory includes two archipelagos —the Azores and Madeira — to questions relating to the seafrom a perspective of the development of balancedmanagement of fishing and marine resources. To this end my country is currently concluding the necessaryprocedures that will soon permit it to ratify the UnitedNations Convention on the Law of the Sea.Furthermore  on Portugal’s initiative  the GeneralAssembly  at its forty-ninth session  declared 1998International Year of the Ocean. Focusing on this subject Expo 98 will be held in Lisbon that same year  with thetheme  “The oceans: a heritage for the future”. Its centralfocus will be the relationship between the current state ofknowledge on marine resources and the urgency ofensuring  through a rational and scientific managementprocess  a greater ecological equilibrium on our planet.The defence and promotion of human rights is one ofthe principal concerns of Portuguese foreign policy. Webelieve that it is the responsibility of every Government toguarantee in their respective countries the full enjoyment ofall human rights  but that it is also legitimate for theinternational community to concern itself with ensuring thepromotion and protection of those rights around the globe.We consider that the United Nations has a key role toplay  and thus it is indispensable that the HighCommissioner and the Centre for Human Rights beprovided with adequate human and financial resources forthe fulfilment of his important task.A constant pursuit of Portuguese foreign policy hasbeen to stress the need to find a political and diplomaticsolution to the question of East Timor  without which itwill not be possible to put an to end the systematic abusesof human rights that continue to prevail in that territory.Portugal has repeatedly stated — and I do so hereonce again — that its sole objective  apart from theimmediate concern of defending the human rights andidentity of the people of East Timor in their differentaspects  is to find a just  comprehensive and internationallyacceptable solution to the question of East Timor  inaccordance with international law and the full respect forthe rights of its people  namely its right toself-determination.Despite the difficulties that have been encountered the difference between the substantive positions ofPortugal and Indonesia and the slowness of the process we continue to be committed to finding such a solutionthrough dialogue and under the auspices of the Secretary-General  whose patient efforts I wish to pay tribute tohere. In the pursuit of that objective  we consider itextremely important to continue the active association ofTimorese representatives to that process  which deservesthe unequivocal support of the international community.In this regard  I must note here the increasingsupport that this question has received from theinternational community  namely through the adoption ofpositions that range from the resolutions of the EuropeanParliament to the declarations of the 21 Heads of Stateand Government of the member countries of the Ibero-American summit  and include the common positionadopted this year by the 15 member States of theEuropean Union  to which a further 14 Europeancountries associated themselves.Portugal  exercising its responsibilities asadministering Power of the non-self-governing territory ofEast Timor  will continue to cooperate constructively withthe United Nations  with full regard for the Charter of theUnited Nations and the relevant resolutions  towards theindispensable conclusion of the process of decolonizationin East Timor.In this era  at the close of the millennium  markedby such profound changes and close interdependencies we believe that the African continent deserves specialattention from the international community. To that end all efforts should be pooled towards the creation ofconditions that will permit it to benefit from adevelopment process similar to that enjoyed by otherregions of the world.We are therefore acting in the context of theinternational organizations of which we are members with the aim of preventing the marginalization of theAfrican continent and ensuring that it receives prioritytreatment on the agenda of the international community.Because we actively uphold this view  Portugal hasproposed to its European Union partners that aEuro-African summit take place  open to the participationof all African States without exception  so as to allow for21a political dialogue at the very highest level on issues ofmutual concern. The goal is to achieve a new dimension toour relations and provide a further impulse to traditionalareas of mutual cooperation in order to create thefoundations of a new global partnership. The 15 MemberStates of the European Union have already recognized theinterest and importance of this initiative.In this manner  we are seeking to include Africa in allits aspects on the international agenda  stressing  on the onehand  the scale and economic potential of the Africancontinent  which is deserving of a new approach and a newmodel for dialogue  and  on the other hand  encouragingAfrican countries to embark on their own process ofdevelopment based on the promotion of peace  democracy stability and economic and social progress.We supported from the very beginning the creationand establishment of the Mechanism for ConflictPrevention  Management and Resolution by theOrganization of African Unity at the Cairo summit in 1993.Portugal attaches great importance to strengthening thedialogue between the European Union and the SouthernAfrican Development Community. The second ministerialsummit  planned for this October in Windhoek  willcertainly allow for a global review of the adequacy of theactivities undertaken as a result of the Berlin conference.Portugal  a member of the troika of observers to thepeace process in Angola  continues to be particularlyengaged in the implementation of the Lusaka Protocol which seeks  in general terms  the re-establishment inAngola of constitutional democratic life and the formationof a single national army.I take this opportunity to salute the SpecialRepresentative of the Secretary-General of the UnitedNations  Mr. Alioune Blondin Beye  whose negotiatingskills constitute an important factor in placing peace andhope in a better future once more on the horizon for allAngolans.We note with satisfaction the positive developmentsthat have taken place over the last few months in theimplementation of the Lusaka Protocol  which havepermitted the cessation of hostilities throughout the entireterritory of Angola. However  we cannot ignore the factthat important tasks remain to be completed  without whichthe irreversibility of the peace process cannot beguaranteed. The postponement of the resolution of militaryand political questions is difficult to understand and mayjeopardize the process of consolidating peace.Allow me therefore to recall the concerns expressedin the declaration of the troika of observers — Portugal the Russian Federation and the United States — issued on22 August 1996. I appeal to the Government of Angolaand to UNITA to continue to follow the path of peacethey have set out on in order to contribute decisively tothe full implementation of the Lusaka Protocol  namelythrough one armed force and the creation of conditionsfor the free movement of people and goods  which wouldmake possible the normal functioning of society  theeconomy and the institutions in that great African country.I should also like to appeal to the internationalcommunity to support the reconstruction and rehabilitationof Angola. In particular  it is urgent that the necessaryfunds be made available for the implementation of theprogrammes for the demobilization of former combatants.Social stability is indispensable to the success of thepeace process.I would not like to end this reference to Africawithout expressing concern for the situation currentlyprevailing in the Great Lakes region  which has tragicrepercussions on the security and well-being of innocentpeoples. Portugal is participating in the efforts of theinternational community to bring to an end this tragedy ofthe African continent and to ensure the return of stabilityto that region.Portugal did not remain indifferent to the sufferingof the peoples of the Balkans or to a situation withserious consequences for peace and stability in the region.Portugal therefore participates in the ImplementationForce with a significant military  police and civiliancontingent  very often demonstrating a greater effort andengagement than that of other countries with largereconomic capacities.The recent elections in Bosnia and Herzegovinarepresented an important step towards the consolidation ofpeace  and we are confident that they will have a lastingeffect on the consolidation of the Bosnian State — basedon its two entities — allowing for a self-sustainedstability of the country and the reconfiguration of theInternational Force so as not to affect the fundamentalgoal of guaranteeing peace and the coexistence of thethree communities.22Portugal will be the host country for the next summitof the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe(OSCE)  which will take place in Lisbon on 2-3 Decembernext. We hope that the 53 Heads of State and Governmentwill take substantial decisions with regard to thecornerstone principles of a security model for the twenty-first century. I am certain that the Lisbon charter  to beadopted at that meeting  will represent a significant steptowards the stability of the European continent and theinstitutional strengthening of the OSCE.Portugal has promoted closer and deeper ties with thecountries of the Mediterranean  especially those of theMaghreb  a region of fundamental importance for thesecurity  stability and development of the entire region. Inthe short term  it is necessary to adopt confidence-buildingmeasures that would contribute to launching the foundationsof a new type of relationship between the peoples of bothsides of the Mediterranean. Portugal is committed to thecreation of a Euro-Mediterranean charter  a matrix for anew partnership that will contribute decisively to thepolitical  economic  social and cultural development of ourMediterranean partners.Portugal is following with great concern the latestdevelopments in the Middle East peace process.We believe that the future of the region dependsessentially on the will of the parties urgently to restart thenegotiations in accordance with the principles of Madridand the Oslo terms of reference. I appeal to all interestedparties to exhibit restraint and to honour previouslyassumed commitments  which is the only way to achieve ajust  comprehensive and lasting peace for the region. Thedramatic incidents that have just occurred are the clearestdemonstration that there is no alternative to the peaceprocess.Portugal has very strong human  historical and culturalties with Latin America. The next Ibero-American Summit which will take place in Chile  will represent anotheroccasion to debate the important advances that theprocesses of democratization and development haveachieved on that continent. Furthermore Portugal welcomesthe holding in 1998 of the seventh Ibero-American Summitof Heads of State and Government.Portugal welcomes the projects for inter-Americanregional integration  as well as the mechanisms forcooperation  that have been gradually established betweenthe countries of that continent and the European Union.The development of a relationship with Asia alsoconstitutes one of the Government of Portugal’s foreign-policy priorities. We share a common historical heritagewith many countries in that region. At the bilateral level in addition to opening new embassies in South-East Asia we will be seeking to strengthen even further ourrelationship with the Pacific island States  which willcertainly be reflected in the framework of the LoméConvention.In terms of our multilateral participation  we hopethat the new dialogue created in the framework of theAssociation of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) willrepresent a significant step in the relationship betweenEurope and Asia  leading to a more open and broadercontact on all matters of mutual interest to the EuropeanUnion and Asia.The transitional process in Macao  to be completedat the end of 1999  based on a constructive dialogue andclose cooperation with China  is of the greatestimportance to the Government of Portugal  whosefundamental concern is to guarantee the prosperity andstability of the territory  as well as to preserve its identity.The multilateral dynamic is undeniably gaining anever-greater importance in the international realities of thepresent. Portugal has been developing unequivocal effortstowards strengthening its participation in the organizationsto which it already belongs and becoming involved innew multilateral frameworks. Clear evidence of Portugal’sattitude in this respect is our increasing participation inpeacekeeping operations. Portugal has considerable forcesin Bosnia and Angola  and currently has the sensitiveresponsibility of ensuring command of the United Nationsforce in the Western Sahara. I am pleased to note that inthe domain of peacekeeping and international security  weare the European Union’s sixth-largest troop contributorto United Nations peacekeeping operations  and the ninthlargest among those countries that make up the WesternEuropean and other States group. We are clearly in thetop half of the list of countries that contribute forces toUnited Nations peacekeeping operations. We also leadother Member States with greater resources and per capitaoutput.Portugal’s candidature for membership of theSecurity Council should be considered as an importantexpression of the will of my country to continue toparticipate  as fully as possible  in the multilateraldimension of today’s world. Portugal is a country with auniversalist commitment  which is used to establishing23contact with many and diverse regions of the world  and tounderstanding and accepting different cultures andcivilizations.We therefore believe that as a member of the SecurityCouncil we would be able to contribute to finding solutionsin accordance with the principles and purposes enshrined inthe Charter. We also believe that participation in theSecurity Council by States of a size and with characteristicssimilar to those of Portugal would contribute to greaterequilibrium and representativity in the decisions taken bythat body.This will be possible only when full respect is givento the principle of sovereign equality of all Member States which  in truth  represents the principal guarantee ofdemocracy in the Security Council. Yet this principle hasnot been observed in practice. Indeed  out of the 185Member States  79 have never served on the SecurityCouncil and 44 have served only once  as is the case withPortugal.We can and should improve this situation. Indeed  toguarantee adequate representation by Member States on theSecurity Council  obstacles or precedents must not be usedthat would prevent a healthy rotation in that organ. Forthese reasons  the Portuguese candidature for membershipof the Security Council is based on its own merits. Werefuse to resort to any alliances  coalitions or other artificialmeans that would limit and condition the right of choice ofMember States.Portugal’s candidature was not launched to defendinterests or to respond to the demands of domestic politics nor was it launched to pursue or consolidate externalambitions. Portuguese foreign policy is an undivided whole.It is part of  and evolves within  a well-definedgeo-strategic space. It is not based on arrogance oreconomic power  nor has it been altered to accommodatePortugal’s candidature. The foreign policy of my country isbased consistently on its universalist commitment todialogue with all the peoples of the world.Before concluding  I should like to cast my vote ofconfidence in the future of the United Nations and toreiterate Portugal’s full commitment to the reform of theOrganization."
"139",5803,"PRY",51,1996,"﻿It is an honour for me  on behalf ofParaguay  its people and its Government  to wish thePresident of the General Assembly  Ambassador RazaliIsmail  every success in his endeavours. We wish also toemphasize the excellent work accomplished by PresidentDiogo Freitas do Amaral  who tirelessly led the proceedingsof the past session.For Paraguay  the United Nations is a form that hasguaranteed the free debate of ideas and the participation ofall without discrimination or exclusion. For a long time  theUnited Nations has been the mandatory beacon of ournations when their essential rights were threatened. ForParaguayans  the fundamental rights of men and women one of the pillars of the United Nations  are today vital —and not just rhetoric — in the search for world peace freedom and security  which only democratic civilianGovernments can guarantee.The new historical reality we face — knowingimmediately what happens elsewhere in the world andwithin or countries — means that we all must share agreater responsibility and solidarity. The globalization oftoday’s world is such that a problem besetting one nationis not an isolated matter  but rather one that must beconsidered by all.This is why we will have to rethink the age-oldquestion of what path all men and women should take.While we belong to diverse ideologies and cultures  wemust nevertheless secure equality  rights and freedoms.Our contributions and suggestions for strengtheningthe Organization and adapting it to the new realities oftoday’s world therefore are made in the spirit ofcooperation. This is why we request that the reforms tobe adopted in the framework of the United Nations beaimed at reducing its fragmentation in order to make it amore functionally integrated structure. Such reform willmake possible more fluid communication and much moreefficient coordination. This is why we insist on reform toeliminate unnecessary costs through the consolidation ofthe programmes aimed at the harmonious development ofour peoples  and to rationalize and optimize existingresources in order to avoid the duplication of human oreconomic efforts.The Government of Paraguay  aware of itsinternational commitments  has made enormous efforts tofulfil its financial obligations to the United Nations. Inthis regard  we send out an appeal for payments ofassessed contributions to be made within establisheddeadlines in order to ensure the operation of theOrganization. The principle of equity so requires this.We must also state that Paraguay’s position on thereform of the United Nations is clear with respect to theGeneral Assembly. We consider this body not only amodel of democratic decision-making  but also — givenits high degree of universality and free exchange ofideas — the most important organ of the system. Wesupport the expansion of the Security Council  whichrequires a larger number of permanent and non-permanentmembers on the basis of equitable geographic distribution.In this connection  we support the view that LatinAmerica should be represented among the permanentmembers  in addition to countries such as Germany andJapan. Paraguay maintains that the exercise of the vetoshould evolve towards innovative mechanisms that wouldbe used more objectively.Programmes that make sustainable economicdevelopment possible constitute another aspect the systemmust take into account. Our country is promoting a social13market economy  free and respectful of private initiative but without disregarding the share of responsibility borneby the Government. We therefore view with satisfaction theleading role of the United Nations in the field of sustainablehuman development. In this connection  we wish tounderscore the binding conventions on the environment  thecommitment made by 118 Heads of State and Governmentto put an end to poverty  unemployment and socialmarginalization  the important results achieved at Habitat IIand the Midrand Declaration of the ninth session of theUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Development.We particularly endorse paragraph 17 of thatDeclaration  which states that“The lack of territorial access to the sea aggravated by remoteness and isolation from worldmarkets  imposes serious constraints on the overallsocio-economic development efforts of the land-lockeddeveloping countries.” (TD/377  para. 17)As such  those countries require sufficient internationalcooperation to maintain and improve their transportationand commercial-exchange infrastructure.Having signed the aforementioned conventions andhaving participated in the aforementioned conference  theParaguayan national Government adopted concrete measuresto implement the provisions of the plans of action thatemerged from those meetings. Thus  following the mandateof the World Summit for Social Development  a secretariatfor social action was established at the ministerial level reporting to the presidency of the Republic. Its fundamentalpurpose will be to prepare public policy on social projectsand to coordinate the actions of the Government and civilsociety in order to improve our people's standard of living.We have also prepared a strategic plan to improveeducation  in conjunction with the educational reformcurrently being implemented by the national Government.We have also devised a map of basic needs — which isalso known as poverty mapping. We have carried out ahousehold survey covering not only urban  but also ruralareas. We are at the moment preparing a system of socialindicators and social expenditures.Furthermore  a year after the holding of the FourthWorld Conference on Women  the public and privatesectors at large have been made keenly aware of itsPlatform for Action  thus fortifying policies relating togender.I wish to express my Government's deep gratitude tothe United Nations system  and particularly to itsSecretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  who hasconstantly and tirelessly helped us work towards the well-being of the people of Paraguay.We are aware that our age is marked by unusualcharacteristics. Contemporary history defines usdifferently. Concepts have changed. Today we speak morepositively and effectively about integration  cooperationand complementarity. The time of sterile confrontation isbehind us. This is a time of solidarity and of reciprocaland diverse cooperation; constructive and creativeinterdependence is the key to our daily coexistence.Today's world needs not only a new economic order but also a new international cultural order. Science knowledge and technology must be our universal heritage.An awareness of solidarity is the way for which humanbeings to understand themselves and others. We shouldsee that without this understanding of others we areinsufficient  incomplete and lacking in humanity. Genuinecomprehensive development requires the cooperation ofall the men and women who inhabit this world. Only inthat way will development as a human right  with theblessing of the Organization and with our strong support find its full meaning and its place in history. Either weremedy our circumstances or we sink in them.However  the disappearance of the rivalries of abipolar world has  unfortunately  not meant the end ofconflict. Throughout this year  we have seen ethnic andnationalistic confrontations that have given rise tooverwhelming human crises that have cut down innocentlives  destroyed property and — still more seriously —brought about the loss of the value of coexistence. In thisstate of affairs  Paraguay hopes that the militaryconfrontations that spill the blood of nations and violatethe right to live will very soon come to an end. Weencourage the consolidation of the peace process in theformer Yugoslavia and the resumption of the peaceprocess in the Middle East in order to find a just andlasting solution in that region.Our country also hopes that efforts will continuetowards the resolution of conflicts in Rwanda andBurundi in order to bring about peace and stability in theGreat Lakes region. Paraguay views with satisfaction theachievements made in Angola  and we hope that theOrganization of African Unity will continue to play animportant role in the prevention and settlement ofconflicts in Africa.14Paraguay notes with great satisfaction the resultsachieved by the United Nations through its peace-keepingMissions in Haiti  its observers in Nicaragua andEl Salvador and its verification Mission in Guatemala which has achieved major success recently. Paraguay is infavour of continuing increasingly to promote themechanisms of preventive diplomacy and  above all  ofpeace-keeping. Similarly  the Republic of Paraguaywelcomes the spirit of reconciliation manifested by theGovernment of the Republic of China. We hope that adialogue will be established to resolve the situation with thePeople’s Republic of China.Now more than ever before  stability and peace are thechallenge. It is imperative to build a multipolar world toguarantee the equitable development of nations and peoples.Equity should be the cornerstone of universal harmony. Inthis spirit  we trust that our Organization’s actions fordisarmament and non-proliferation of nuclear weapons willprove effective and will strengthen our battle against allthreats to peace and world security. Faithful to this purpose Paraguay co-sponsored the resolution on the ComprehensiveNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty  which was adopted by theGeneral Assembly last 10 September. We encourage allMember States of this great Organization to sign the Treaty as I did a few days ago as Minister for Foreign Affairs ofParaguay. We urge that the Treaty be promptly ratified sothat it may enter into force.Almost 50 years ago  on 10 December 1948  theGeneral Assembly adopted and proclaimed the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights. Thus did mankind achieveone of its most precious goals: a Declaration of rights forwhich peoples and nations  individuals and societies  hadalways fought. In Paraguay today  we firmly believe thatwe have learned the hard lesson of living in peace democracy and pluralism. The era of oppression and of alack of basic freedoms  economic backwardness andcultural isolation is past. It is part of a sad history that wewill remember only so as not to repeat it. The democracywe are building today  with the active participation of ourcitizens and the solidarity of the international community is part of an irreversible process.Of course  barely four months ago  a small group nostalgic for authoritarianism  tried to turn back the clock.But thanks to the prompt support of friendly nations and tothe spontaneous and courageous action of young peoplewho took to the streets to defend the democratic process we were able to abort a military adventure that could havecaused irreparable damage to our country. Fortunately  ourcountry is today moving straight towards a strengthening ofall its freedoms and towards democratic stability in itspolitical system.We are greatly pleased that Paraguay was able toovercome its institutional crisis with the weapons ofdemocracy. The threat of force against our institutionswas combated with our democratic beliefs. TheGovernment averted the danger without resorting to anymeasures in violation of the Constitution or our laws.Even at the most difficult times  we maintained freedomof the press. No citizen was imprisoned and noemergency laws were decreed. Our victory was based onour belief in political pluralism and the right of dissent.Thus  the calm and decisive action of the President of theRepublic of Paraguay  Juan Carlos Wasmosy  restored theautonomy of civilian rule. We stopped being a democracyunder the protection of military power and became acivilian democracy  free from interference or pressurefrom outside forces.Having made this historic  political step  theGovernment and the people of Paraguay are deeplygrateful to the Member States of this Organization fortheir support during that delicate crisis. In particular  weare grateful to the Security Council for its clear andunflinching support of Paraguayan democracy. Thissupport further strengthened our faith in the UnitedNations efforts to maintain democratic politicalinstitutions  freedom  peace and international security.Paraguay's foreign policy is based primarily onregional economic integration  at the centre of which isthe Southern Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR). Weare convinced that the Latin American integration processis the key to our country’s integration into the worldeconomy and to the consolidation of our democracy.Following this policy  we have undertaken many activitieswith a view to expanding the links between our internalmarket and international economic processes.Another important element has been the frontalattack on international organized crime. The task is noteasy. For years political and economic corruption werethe modus operandi of the dictatorship. None the less  theGovernment of Paraguay is committed to fighting thescourge of drug trafficking and money-laundering. Weencourage the public  national and foreign alike  to reportirregularities worthy of investigation  inspection or reviewso as to eliminate the sources of corruption. With its newattitude of political transparency  the Government has senta draft bill to the National Congress which defines andaims to suppress the crime of money-laundering 15including the laundering of profits from the illicit sale ofnarcotics  psychotropic substances and dangerous drugs. Anational drug-control plan is also being drawn up.Fifty years after the establishment of the InternationalCourt of Justice in The Hague  my country — fulfilling thepromise President Wasmosy made last year to the GeneralAssembly — yesterday deposited with the Secretary-General of the United Nations the instruments of acceptanceof the jurisdiction of the Court. This decision is one furthercommitment on my country’s part to the universal societyin which we believe. As Minister for Foreign Affairs of mynation  I will always remember having been the vessel ofthis historic decision. We also reiterate  as a land-lockedcountry  the importance of the Convention and the reformsto the Convention on the Law of the Sea. We express ourfaith in the principle of the universal heritage of mankindthrough our presence as a member of the council of theInternational Seabed Authority.Here at the beginning of the fifty-first session of theGeneral Assembly of the United Nations  as Minister forForeign Affairs I would like to take the liberty of makinga declaration of faith. Too young to have known thefounding  the first achievements  the main crises  thechanges and the development of the institutions of theUnited Nations  I belong to a generation destined to play arole in the twenty-first century.When I was born  the human rights covenants hadalready been written  the environment was already aconcern for all peoples  and the universal diplomaticconventions and legal system of treaties were already inplace. Such is our world at the end of the century. Thus  insupporting reform  Paraguay believes that it is necessary tomention through me that there is one thing that we will notbe able to change: our purposes and goals  which we mustpreserve for future generations.We will reaffirm time and time again the equality ofnations  large and small  and the importance of creatingconditions for the rule of international law. Here in theGeneral Assembly  the soul of the United Nations representing a young nation which has yet enjoyed 200years of independence and speaking before age-old peoplesand cultures  I reaffirm mankind’s utopia: a common beliefrenewed that we can affirm this forever to be our home."
"140",5868,"QAT",51,1996,"﻿Itgives me pleasure  Sir  to extend to you our sincerecongratulations on your election to the presidency of theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-first session. We areconfident that you will lead the work of the Assembly tosuccess. I cannot fail to pay tribute to your predecessor Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral of Portugal  for hisleadership during the Assembly’s historic fiftieth session.I would also like to express our appreciation toHis Excellency the Secretary-General  Mr. BoutrosBoutros-Ghali  for his tireless efforts in the service of thepurposes of the United Nations in the maintenance ofinternational peace and security and the achievement ofits lofty ideals.A series of internal conflicts and explosive situationshas threatened certain States. The world faces ethnicextremism and national conflicts caused by massmigrations  flows of refugees  environment deteriorationand natural disasters. Such problems have not been metwith the rapid economic and political changes that wouldform the cornerstone of the new international order towhich the whole world aspires. A complete vision of thatorder  its rules and means  has not yet materialized. Weshould all work towards an international system that isjust  balanced and comprehensive.The vital and effective role played by the UnitedNations in dealing with international issues  in themaintenance of international peace and security and inother areas  the value of which cannot be denied orunderestimated for the establishment of the principles ofthat international system  requires reform of the UnitedNations if we are to achieve the desired results. Reformshould begin with reactivating the General Assembly toenable it to act effectively in a manner that would enhanceits credibility in the eyes of world public opinion.We have also mentioned the need to reform theSecurity Council and increase its effectiveness in a mannerthat would reflect the geographic  economic and politicalsituation of certain States  in a manner that would reflectthe new international order  and would equip the Council tobear its heavy responsibilities.The task of maintaining international peace andsecurity is particularly important at a time of internationalchange; the international community should take steps todeploy early preventive measures  since this is the best wayto avoid the eruption and conflagration of conflicts  insteadof resorting to political or military measures to end them which can only lead to incomplete and unjust solutions.Therefore  it is important to reiterate the vital and effectiverole that could be played by regional organizations in thecontext of the maintenance of international peace andsecurity in accordance with Chapter VIII of the Charter.Cooperation between the United Nations and otherregional organizations such as the Organization for Securityand Cooperation in Europe  the Organization of AfricanUnity  the League of Arab States and the Organization ofthe Islamic Conference should be promoted  sincepreventive diplomacy and early warning are the best way toprevent conflicts from erupting and to find peacefulsolutions.The question of disarmament is of great importance interms of the establishment of international peace andsecurity. It can be achieved only by curbing the arms raceand  in particular  the race in weapons of mass destruction.We believe that the indefinite extension of the Treaty onthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) requiresmore support and ratification by all States to give theTreaty a global character. The State of Qatar reaffirms theneed for Israel to join the NPT and to place its nuclearfacilities under the safeguards system of the InternationalAtomic Energy Agency as an initial step towardsestablishing a Middle East free from nuclear weapons andweapons of mass destruction. We believe that the interestsof the stability and security of the region should compelIsrael to do this.The State of Qatar  on the basis of the wise approachof His Royal Highness  Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa Al-Thani  reaffirms its regional and international commitmentsand undertakes to work through international and regionalorganizations to promote international peace and security.We associate ourselves with our brothers in the GulfCooperation Council and other friendly States in the questto promote peace and security in the Gulf region  due toits vital importance to the whole world. We are alsomaking tireless efforts to establish friendly andconstructive relations with all States of the region  basedon good-neighbourliness  mutual respect  non-interferencein the internal affairs of other States  respect forlegitimacy and the solution of conflicts through dialogue mediation or international law through the InternationalCourt of Justice.On the basis of this principle  we support the attemptto find such a solution to the dispute between the UnitedArab Emirates and the Islamic Republic of Iran on theislands of Abu Musa and Lesser and Greater Tunb. Wehave expressed our great satisfaction at the agreementsigned between the Republic of Yemen and Eritrea inParis last month regarding the peaceful settlement of thedispute over Greater Hanish through internationalmediation and arbitration  peacefully and in accordancewith the Charter of the United Nations and internationallaw  in a manner that will serve the security and stabilityof the Red Sea region and promote bilateral relations good-neighbourliness and common interests between thosetwo countries and bolster international peace and security.At the same time  we would like to express ourappreciation to the friendly Government of France for itsefforts towards a peaceful settlement of this dispute.The State of Qatar has expressed its brotherlyfeelings and sympathy with the people of Iraq  who areliving under extremely difficult conditions due to thesanctions imposed on them. On the basis of that  we havewelcomed the oil-for-food agreement between Iraq andthe United Nations regarding the application of SecurityCouncil resolution 986 (1995)  since this would mitigatethe suffering of the Iraqi people and enable them to meettheir need for food and medication. We call upon theUnited Nations to create the conditions necessary forimplementation of that resolution.We would also like to reaffirm our commitment tothe unity and territorial integrity of Iraq  and the principleof non-interference in its internal affairs. Yet at the sametime  Iraq is required fully to implement all SecurityCouncil resolutions  which should stay within the contextof international legitimacy and the norms of internationallaw.We express our great concern at the suffering of thepeople of Libya due to the sanctions imposed on them.2We associate ourselves in this regard with many otherMember States regarding the approach followed in theimplementation of the sanctions  and we call for thecreation of necessary guarantees for the equitableapplication of the sanctions so that international interestsare safeguarded and the suffering of the people as a resultof the sanctions is alleviated.The State of Qatar has worked to promote theachievement of a just  comprehensive and lasting peace inthe Middle East. We therefore took part in the ArabSummit Conference in Cairo in June 1996  when Arableaders reaffirmed that the achievement of peace requiresfull Israeli withdrawal from all occupied Palestinianterritories  including Arab Jerusalem  conditions for thePalestinians to establish an independent State of its ownwith Jerusalem as its capital  and the full and unconditionalwithdrawal of Israeli forces from the Syrian Golan andsouthern Lebanon pursuant to Security Council resolutions242 (1967)  338 (1973) and 425 (1975) and in accordancewith the principle of land for peace accepted by the Arabsand by Israel as a serious basis for peace in the MiddleEast.From this rostrum  we would like to call upon the newIsraeli Government to continue its efforts to ensure asuccessful peace process in the Middle East and to takeaccount of United Nations resolutions  especially those thatwere the background of the Madrid Conference  and theprinciple of land for peace  in accordance with agreementsalready reached. We would like the Israeli Government toreconsider its position in order to give momentum to thepeace process  to establish conditions conducive tocooperation among the peoples of the region and to achievea lasting and comprehensive peace in the Middle East.We call upon the two co-sponsors of the peace processand the international community in its entirety to supportthe peace process while at the same time providing thenecessary economic and political assistance to thePalestinian people and the Palestinian Authority.The State of Qatar expresses its deep concern atIsrael’s continued confiscation of Palestinian territories  theestablishment of settlements in the occupied Arab territoriesand the bringing in of settlers in violation of internationaldecisions  the provisions of the Fourth Geneva Conventionrelative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time ofWar and the provisions adopted at the Madrid Conference.These settler activities in the Syrian Golan  theoccupied Palestinian territories and Arab Jerusalem shouldcease without delay. We would also like to reiterate ourrejection of any attempt to change the demographiccharacter of the Arab city of Jerusalem or its legal status specifically its geographic and geopolitical status before4 June 1967. We call upon the international communityto guarantee Israel’s implementation of bindinginternational resolutions regarding Jerusalem  in particularSecurity Council resolution 252 (1968)  since theestablishment of a comprehensive and just peace in theMiddle East cannot be achieved without solving the issueof Arab Jerusalem and the problems of the Palestinianrefugees  who should be granted the right to return inaccordance with binding international decisions and theresolutions of the United Nations.Qatar believes that the process of establishingcomprehensive and just peace in the region is the onlystrategic option and that the decision of the IsraeliGovernment to open a tunnel adjacent to Al-Aqsa Al-Sharif is a violation and desecration of sacred Islamicsites and a provocation of Arabs and Muslims all over theworld. It runs counter to the peace process  is a violationof the Fourth Geneva Convention and threatens to freezethe peace process and return the region to tension andviolence.From this rostrum  we call upon the co-sponsors ofthe peace process and the international community to puta speedy end to Israeli actions against the Palestinians inthe occupied territories in order to safeguard the rights ofthe Palestinian people. We furthermore call upon allparties to continue negotiations and implement all theprovisions of the agreements reached so far. We lookforward to a successful conclusion of the Washingtonmeeting and to tangible measures that would lead to thepermanent closing of the tunnel and the immediatewithdrawal of Israeli forces from Palestinian areas.The Middle East region and the whole world havesuffered greatly from terrorism. We condemn terrorism inall its forms and have always supported internationalefforts to deal with this phenomenon. We are committedto promoting all initiatives to convene an internationalconference on this problem. Our participation in theSharm el-Sheikh Conference was yet another testimony toour interest in this issue. However  we would like toreiterate that resisting occupation and aggression shouldnot be stigmatized as terrorism  since it is done in defenceof international rights.We pay tribute to the people of Bosnia andHerzegovina  who have defended their entity and their3honourable ideals of tolerance and justice through morethan four years of aggression and genocide. We reiterateour commitment to the unity of the territory of Bosnia andHerzegovina  and to its sovereignty within itsinternationally recognized borders. We likewise call uponall parties to completely implement the provisions of theDayton Agreement and make efforts to bring war criminalsto justice.The State of Qatar welcomes the agreement reached toput an end to the bloodshed in Chechnya  and we hope thatthe parties concerned will work for the establishment ofpeace and security in that region.Developments in the world economy and the newprospects they offer  starting with the signing of theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and theestablishment of the World Trade Organization (WTO) require further measures to help fragile economies todevelop and to give momentum to the global economy.It is important therefore to reconsider the issues ofthe cost of weapons and the settlement of disputes bypeaceful means  such as preventive diplomacy and theprovision of the necessary material and human resources.The costs saved in this manner must be rechannelled toassist developing countries to bolster their economies andraise the living standards of their citizens. Assistance fromdeveloped and rich countries should be used to combatpoverty and underdevelopment.The issues of poverty  underdevelopment anddeprivation also threaten the environment. Theoverpopulation of our world has been a constant threat formany years and can only lead to a deterioration of theenvironment and to the spread of poverty in many countriesof the world. Huge resources are squandered on non-essentials that cannot help to bridge the gap between richand poor countries. The situation is getting more seriousevery day  and we should all be aware that a solution tothese problems requires a reconsideration of thesquandering of these resources in ways that do not alleviatehuman suffering or even meet human needs in poorcountries all over the world. Developed countries andinternational organizations should bear the responsibility infinding the proper solutions to these problems to raise thestandard of living of poor peoples. The new world ordershould not add to suffering and poverty in poor countries.We reaffirm our confidence in the United Nations andour support for this unique international institution thatbears the responsibility of dealing with grave humanitarian social  economic and political problems and that attemptsto find effective solutions to these problems in accordancewith the high ideals contained in the Charter for theestablishment of a peaceful  secure and prosperous worldin which cooperation should prevail."
"141",5914,"ROU",51,1996,"﻿I have the particular pleasure of congratulatingyou  Sir  on your election as President of the fifty-firstsession of the General Assembly and of expressing oursatisfaction at seeing in such a high position therepresentative of a country and a region so widelyappreciated for their traditions and dynamism. I amconvinced that your experience and your qualities as aneminent diplomat will facilitate the proceedings and thesuccessful outcome of this session. I would like also toexpress our thanks to your predecessor  Mr. Diogo Freitasdo Amaral of Portugal  for the able manner in which hedirected the previous session of the General Assembly.Allow me to take this opportunity to express our highappreciation for the remarkable activity carried out withsuch dedication since 1992 by the Secretary-General Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  to the benefit of the UnitedNations.The Assembly has gathered again not only to reviewrecent regional and world developments or to survey lastyear’s results  but also to discuss especially the prospectsand challenges we are facing at the threshold of thetwenty-first century.We are essentially called upon to reflect and actjointly on establishing an international system that canguarantee security  stability  progress and prosperity forall. The United Nations is certainly the pillar of such asystem. The conclusion of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty  which we have just signed  is proof ofthis. We are among those who consider that we now havea historic opportunity to insure world security andstability through the establishment of democraticinstitutions  sustainable development  respect for humanrights and social justice. This requires better internationalcooperation and a new spirit of partnership among allcountries.Romania intends to contribute to this common effortthrough consolidation of its achievements in the buildingof a new democratic society based on the rule of law respect for human rights and a market economy  with aview to establishing itself as a stabilizing factor in theregion.In referring to some of the significant events of thepast year  I will recall that our macro-economic policyand the progress we have made in the establishment ofinstitutions adapted to a market economy have led to asteady improvement of economic performance. Theprivate sector has become preponderant in our grossdomestic product. In order to overcome the difficulties oftransition and to prepare for integration into the EuropeanUnion  Romania has received substantial assistance fromthe European Union and its members. The United Stateshas granted Romania permanent most favoured nationstatus. My country has become a full member of theCentral European Initiative and next year will become partof the Central European free trade agreement. The signingof a Treaty of Understanding  Cooperation and Good-Neighbourliness between Romania and Hungary was asignificant event not only for our historic reconciliation  butalso for stability in Central Europe.I would also like to take note of my country’s activeparticipation in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’sPartnership for Peace programme and in the ImplementationForces operation in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Thesestrengthen our belief that a favourable decision will betaken on our integration into the Atlantic Alliance.At the subregional level  Romania supported themeasures aimed at the advancement of the Black SeaEconomic Cooperation and of the process of stability andgood-neighbourly relations in south-east Europe  which isalso the subject of initiatives by the European Union andthe United States. Aware of the importance of thedemocratization process  the Romanian Government hasdecided to host the third International Conference on Newor Restored Democracies in Bucharest in early September1997.All these developments and initiatives testify to mycountry’s willingness to act as a credible and responsiblepartner in international affairs and as a stabilizing factorand source of security in Europe and the world.On the occasion of the commemorative meeting heldon the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the entry intoforce of the Charter of United Nations  numerous heads ofState — including the President of Romania — pointed outthat the Organization can and should play a greater role ininternational relations in order to respond more effectivelyto global challenges. It is becoming increasingly evidentthat we are at a point in history when numerous problemshave to be reconsidered from a global perspective if we areto forge a common vision wherein the individual is thefocus of our policies. The main problem to be solved at thedawn of the third millennium is finding the appropriatesynthesis between the general aspiration to universality andthe individual aspiration to identity.The series of major global conferences organized bythe United Nations over these past five years have led to anew integrated concept of sustainable developmentfocused on the human being.Now that we are in the process of revitalizing strengthening and reforming the United Nations system including a limited enlargement of the Security Council we consider it timely and useful to capitalize on theseachievements. It would also be desirable to agree on anintegrated common vision of development and on a list ofpriorities that would inspire and guide the general processof renewal of the United Nations. By acting in this way we will be able to facilitate our current objective  as longas the working groups established by the GeneralAssembly hasten their achievement of balanced andrealistic results.Along with the other Member States  Romania alsoconsiders that the moment has come to proceed to anexpansion of the membership of the Security Council both in the category of permanent members — for whichGermany and Japan are preeminently qualified by theirimportance in international affairs — as in the category ofnon-permanent members. This should be done through anagreed formula  based on proposals already put forward such as the Italian  which represents a good basis forensuring that an increased number of States — includingthose of central and eastern Europe — be represented inthe Council. In short  a special meeting of the GeneralAssembly should be called on the results of the reform ofthe United Nations system.Having made these general remarks  I would like tomake a few comments on particular issues of our agenda.First  with regard to crisis and conflict management it is clearly and primarily the responsibility of the partiesdirectly involved to put an end to conflict and to restorepeace and security. We underscore the importance weattach to dialogue as a means of reaching negotiatedsolutions by the parties directly concerned.We will contribute to the establishment of normalrelations and the full implementation of the DaytonAgreement among the countries of the former Yugoslavia including the lifting of the sanctions against the FederalRepublic of Yugoslavia. We welcomed with interest theinitiatives on the economic reconstruction of the regionand are fully prepared to take an active part in thisprocess  including through joint cooperation projects withneighbouring countries.We express our deep concern over the recentworrying developments in the Middle East peace process2which are the object of Security Council resolution 1073(1996). We welcome the United States initiative aimed atthe resumption of negotiations between the parties on thebasis of the principles agreed upon in Madrid and Oslo  asthey represent the only way to build a just and lastingpeace. Romania recognizes the necessity of strengtheningregional economic cooperation in support of the peaceprocess in the Middle East and is actively involved in themultilateral working groups.We are still concerned about the ongoing  complexand uncertain situation in the eastern part of the Republicof Moldova and we reaffirm the necessity for anunconditional and orderly withdrawal of foreign troops fromthe Transdniester region.We accord due attention to all initiatives aimed at anyprocess that could lead to a lasting peace in the Koreanpeninsula and in other regions of tension and conflict.As the main guarantor of international peace andsecurity  the United Nations should participate moreactively in the prevention and management of crises byemploying flexible peace instruments  including preventivediplomacy and peace-keeping operations. The experiencegained by contributing States — including Romania particularly as a result of its significant participation in theUnited Nations peace-keeping Mission in Angola —highlights the necessity of increasing rapid-reaction capacityby improving the standby system and other measures aimedat the rapid deployment of new peace-keeping operationsand the efficient management of current ones.With regard to sanctions  Romania  which has beendeeply affected by the strict implementation of economicsanctions  especially in the case of the former Yugoslavia believes that the United Nations should play a larger role inthe process of compensating third countries so that theefficiency and credibility of Security Council actions in thisarea can be preserved.Secondly  I would like to make some comments inconnection with non-proliferation  arms control anddisarmament. As a party to the process since its inception Romania welcomed with satisfaction the adoption of theComprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty. This major steprepresents a crucial stage in the fulfilment of one of themain objectives in the implementation of relevantobligations of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation ofNuclear Weapons. The establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones in South-East Asia  the Pacific and Africa isaimed at the same objective.Romania will continue to contribute to the promotionof the review process of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  both before the nextReview Conference in the year 2000  the preparatorycommittee of which will convene in 1997. We will alsogive equal attention to the speedy commencement ofnegotiations on a treaty banning the production of fissilematerials  as well as to the implementation of theConvention on the Prohibition of the Development Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological)and Toxin Weapons and On Their Destruction and theestablishment of an efficient verification mechanism.We again invite all States to consider establishing acode of conduct for conventional arms transfers whichwill increase transparency and confidence among Statesin that field.Romania supports all efforts leading to the total banof anti-personnel mines. To this end  in 1995  theRomanian Government declared a moratorium  which willbe extended this year  and has begun the ratificationprocedures of the additional Protocols to the Conventionon Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of CertainConventional Weapons.My third and last thought relates to the economicand social areas  where we believe there are goodprospects for the adoption of the Agenda forDevelopment. Romania endorses the idea that the UnitedNations can and should contribute to implementing a newglobal partnership for development among developingcountries  developed countries and multilateralinstitutions. We noted with interest the inclusion of thisconcept in the economic communiqué adopted at therecent Group of Seven summit meeting in Lyon  as wellas the recognition of the fact that the new partnershipshould be beneficial to all and based on a spirit ofsolidarity that will distribute responsibility among allpartners.Within this framework  the United Nations and itsinstitutions should pursue reform and adjustment effortswith a view to improving their performance in thebuilding of consensus in the area of development. Wewelcome the results of the ninth session of the UnitedNations Conference on Trade and Development inMidrand as an essential step in its renewal. The sessionpaved the way for the reform of its intergovernmentalstructure  and the reorientation of its priorities in order todevelop cooperation with the World Trade Organizationand the Bretton Woods financial institutions. This will3lead to the integration of developing countries and countriesin transition into the global commercial and financialsystem.We also note the measures recently taken to strengthenthe Economic and Social Council’s central role inestablishing and coordinating joint policies  as well as theinitiatives of the Economic Commission for Europe andother regional Commissions in redefining their priorities.The Economic and Social Council has theresponsibility to ensure the follow-up to the majorinternational conferences. We will work together inpreparing the 1997 special session of the General Assemblyin order to improve the implementation of agreementsreached on environmental protection at the Rio Conferenceand at the Vienna regional conference on the review of theSocial Summit in Copenhagen. It is worth mentioning thata subregional conference recently held in Bucharestprovided a useful evaluation of the implementation of theBeijing Platform for Action on the status of women inCentral and Eastern Europe.We support the United Nations fight against the abuseof drugs and illicit drug trafficking  including all forms ofrelated crimes. We intend to participate in the preparationsof the 1998 special session of the General Assemblydevoted to this scourge.The international community must also be mobilizedto confront the rapid rise in transnational organized crimeand terrorism. We encourage more active participation onthe part of the United Nations. In this respect  we welcomethe proposal put forward here last week by PresidentKwasniewski of Poland.Development assistance requires a new and betterresponse from the international community in the promotionof our common objective of sustainable and sociallyequitable growth focused on the human being and on theprotection of the environment. Aid flows should be moreefficient and directed towards the countries in real need.Romania maintains good cooperation with the UnitedNations Development Programme and its residentrepresentative in Bucharest  other funds and developmentprogrammes — including the United Nations PopulationFund and the United Nations Children’s Fund — and withthe specialized agencies and the Bretton Woods institutions.We insure that the assistance we receive is used forstructural reforms  and macroeconomic stabilization and thatit likewise contributes to the creation of favourableconditions for the expansion of a dynamic andcompetitive private sector.Finally  I wish to reaffirm my country’s deepcommitment to the universal nature of human rights andfundamental freedoms  the promotion and observance ofwhich represent a priority for the United Nations.In view of this premise  the Romanian Governmentcondemns any form of discrimination and intolerance especially aggressive nationalism  and intends toguarantee the free and equal exercise of human rights including the rights of women  children and personsbelonging to national minorities. We support the effortsof the High Commissioner for Human Rights  as overallcoordinator of the specialized bodies within the UnitedNations system in improving the efficiency of the Centrefor Human Rights.The best guarantee for the observance of humanrights lies in developing democracy. This component ofthe “democracy-development-peace” triad brings me to afinal reflection about the United Nations contribution tothe process of worldwide democratization. By conveningin Bucharest  in September 1997  the third InternationalConference on New or Restored Democracies  we wish tocontinue the dialogue and the sharing of experience inbuilding democratic societies by contributing theexperiences of Romania  a country in Central Europe thatis reviving  irreversibly  its best democratic traditions afterso many years of dictatorship.I wish to assure the Assembly that my country willdo its best  in concert with all interested countries  toenable the United Nations — the guarantor of peace andinternational legality — to respond more efficiently to theproblems we all share."
"142",5960,"RUS",51,1996,"﻿The agenda of the General Assembly atthe current session reflects all the complexity of the stagemankind is now going through  the essence of which isthe transition from bloc confrontation to multipolarity economic interdependence and the democratization ofinternational relations.I would like to emphasize that during the past yearRussia made its contribution to the consolidation of thisvery trend. At the domestic level  this means anuncompromising continuation of the process of reformingsociety. The results of the recent presidential elections inour country have convincingly proved that Russia hasdecisively embarked on the road to the future. Themajority of Russians voted for the continuation ofeconomic reform  for a State of law and for a policy ofopenness and cooperation.In our relations with the other Commonwealth ofIndependent States (CIS) countries  we resolutely opposeboth the idea of restoring the Soviet Union  an idea basedon the denial of the sovereignty of the CommonwealthStates  and narrow-minded national isolationism. Westand for the voluntary integration and unification of the13members of the Commonwealth and hold that it should notbe isolated from the rest of the world. We wish to ensure and we shall ensure  that the CIS will become an importantcentre of world economic development and internationalstability.On a wider international plane  Russia is pursuing apolicy aimed at establishing a new world order firmly basedon the equality of all States  justice and universal security.However  the establishment of such a world order is a slowprocess  influenced by both objective and subjective factors.It is only natural that the end of the cold war provided astarting point for the transition to achieving a stable andpredictable peace at the global level.But zones of regional conflict have expandeddrastically. The upsurge of terrorism has caused universalshock  and the threat of proliferation of weapons of massdestruction is emerging. The rejection of ideological military-force confrontation  brought about by the end ofthe cold war  clearly proved insufficient to neutralize allthese dangers and risks.Let us confess  at least to ourselves  that we will notsucceed here unless  first and foremost  we overcome theinertia of the political mentality. Unfortunately  thestereotypes that took root in the minds of severalgenerations of statesmen during the 40 years of the coldwar have not yet disappeared along with the dismantling ofstrategic missiles and the destruction of thousands of tanks.In this connection  I would like to single out threeconditions for the transformation of international relationsduring the post-cold-war period.First  we should see to it that the old fronts of blocconfrontation are not replaced with new lines of division.That is precisely why we accept neither the idea of theexpansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization(NATO) military infrastructure to the area of the nowdefunct Warsaw Treaty nor the efforts to make that alliancethe axis of a new European system. The enormouspossibilities for economic cooperation and the spiritualenrichment of all the peoples of the continent can berealized only through the creation of a genuinelyall-European system of international relations. TheOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe(OSCE) Lisbon summit must be an important stage in theconstruction of such a Europe.It is important to stress in general that the logic of amultipolar world in the twenty-first century should differqualitatively from the schemes outlined by Metternich andBismarck. The way towards the establishment of a systemof comprehensive security is through learning the skills ofequal partnership between the various “poles”  rather thanthrough the revival of reflexes of rivalry and of balanceof power.The threat of new lines of division is appearing notonly in Europe  but elsewhere. The understandableintolerance of the extremism of certain Islamic groups andfactions must not develop into a categorization of theMuslim world at large as an enemy of moderncivilization. This is probably one of the pressingrequirements of our day.Russia advocates resolute opposition to extremist andterrorist forces. They are especially dangerous when theyenjoy State support  and no effort should be spared toprevent any State from rendering such support. Thiscannot be justified. I believe it is time a universalconvention  covering all States without exception  wereelaborated within the United Nations  denying politicalasylum anywhere to persons engaged in terroristactivities. However  no sanctions should be used as ameans to punish peoples or as an instrument to overthrowGovernments. It is far more effective to offer prospectsfor a better future to those who renounce extremism andaccept the norms of conduct by the world community.The second condition for achieving a durable peaceis the emancipation from a mentality based on conceptsof leaders and followers. Such a mentality is fuelled byillusions that some countries emerged from the cold waras victors  and others as the vanquished. But this is notthe case. Peoples on both sides of the Iron Curtain jointlystrove to rid themselves of the policy of confrontation.Meanwhile  the mentality based on leaders and followerspaves the way directly towards the establishment of aunipolar world. Such a world-order model is unacceptabletoday to the overwhelming majority of the internationalcommunity.Finally  the third condition for the successfulmovement towards stable peace lies in the coordinatedactivities of the international community. Today  one ofthe most important tasks is the settlement of regional andlocal conflicts. In this regard  significant progress hasbeen achieved recently. Peace agreements are beingimplemented in Bosnia. Initial important agreements havebeen achieved for a durable peace in the Middle East. Wehave managed to secure ceasefires in Transdniester Abkhazia  South Ossetia and Nagorny Karabakh. Thesituation has improved somewhat in the conflict zones on14the African continent and in Latin America. But as yet nobreakthrough to a durable peace has been achieved in anyof these hotbeds of tension.The future of the Middle East is a cause for graveconcern. Russia — one of the sponsors of the peaceprocess — cannot accept the sacrifice to tacticalconsiderations and internal political manoeuvres of the firstfruits of the peace negotiations  which were won at such agreat cost. The implementation of the Agreements reachedis the only realistic basis for maintaining the peace process.The only possible way forward is to advance throughnegotiation on the basis of the principle of “land for peace” Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)  aswell as resolution 425 (1978)  which deals with Lebanon.It should be clear that the danger of reverting toconfrontation becomes greater as the artificial pause in thepeace process continues. When negotiators are silent  lethalweapons begin to awake.We appreciate the peacemaking efforts of the UnitedStates of America  the European Union  France  Egypt andother members of the international community and wesupport an even closer partnership in peacemaking. That isthe most effective way to promote peace-building in theMiddle East.The Bosnian settlement has entered a new and crucialstage since the elections of 14 September. The prospects fora lasting peace have become greater  but the risk of slippinginto a new spiral of hostility and confrontation remains. Icall upon all the Bosnian parties to take full advantage ofthe chance for peace created by the internationalcommunity. At the same time  the United Nations  theOSCE  members of the Contact Group and the HighRepresentative should immediately take a just and balancedapproach to resolving outstanding problems. Assistance forthe social and economic reconstruction of Bosnia andHerzegovina should be intensified considerably andconditions created for the return of refugees.The time has also come to look beyond the horizon ofthe Paris agreements. There would seem to be a need for alarge-scale and prolonged civilian peacemaking operation inwhich the United Nations and its specialized agencies willplay an important role. The international military and policepresence  to which Russia contributes  should remain afactor in the peace process for a given period afterDecember 1996.The lifting of sanctions against the Federal Republicof Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) and the BosnianSerbs is an indispensable condition for a successful peacein the former Yugoslavia. I hope that  in the near future a Yugoslav delegation will take its place in this Hall  asit has at the Organization for Security and Cooperation inEurope.The programme of disarmament  security andstability for the twenty-first century should become one ofthe major axes of transition period strategy. The adoptionof the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty is onehuge step in this direction. Russia has just signed theTreaty and we believe that it is of fundamentalimportance for all countries with nuclear capability toaccede to it. However  it should clearly be understood thattesting by any country of a nuclear explosive devicebefore the Treaty enters into force will radically changethe international situation and greatly prejudice the Treatyitself  and may compel many countries to revise theirattitude to it.I should like to draw the attention of the Treaty’sopponents to the fact that it will not only contribute to thepromotion of nuclear non-proliferation  but willobjectively stimulate a gradual transition to nucleardisarmament on a multilateral basis. That is the purposeof President Yeltsin’s proposal to conclude a treaty onnuclear security and stability with the participation of allthe nuclear Powers. We invite interested States to beginexchanging views on the issue. Our suggestion thatnuclear arsenals be located only on the territories of thenuclear Powers in question remains current.The strengthening of the non-proliferation regime forweapons of mass destruction depends directly uponreliable prevention of the illicit traffic in fissile materials.The Moscow Summit of the Eight on Nuclear Safety andSecurity  convened as a result of a Russian initiative contributed significantly to a solution of this problem. Icall on all United Nations Member States to becomeinvolved in the implementation of the Moscowagreements.The rights of an individual should occupy a centralplace in any new concept of international security.Strengthening the international human-rights protectionmechanism could ensure the observance of these rights.Its oversight and preventive functions should beconsolidated and made more practical. However legitimate efforts to ensure respect for human rightscannot serve political purposes. It is too delicate an areato be invaded by political speculation and objectives.15My comments apply fully to the protection of therights of national minorities. The relevance of this problemis evident in today’s world. The complexity of thesituation — let us be frank — requires a link between theprotection of the rights of national minorities andobservance of the principle of the territorial integrity ofStates. Russia is directing its policy at precisely such a link.My comments also apply to the Baltic States. Whilerecognizing the sovereignty of those countries and theirterritorial integrity  Russia cannot remain indifferent to thediscriminatory practices pursued against theRussian-speaking populations in Estonia and Latvia. Whileacknowledging measures that have already been taken toimprove the situation  we believe that the United Nationsand other international organizations should intensify andsystematize their work for the protection of the rights ofnational minorities.How do we implement this strategy for creating a newworld order? Despite the importance of bilateral relationsand successful regional organizations  the United Nationsremains the principal mechanism capable of ensuring thetransition from a bipolar and confrontational world to amultipolar and democratic one. In such circumstances  thesignificance of the United Nations as a centre forcoordinating the actions of States is increasing. During theformation of a multipolar system  the United Nations iscalled upon to serve as a kind of safety net  minimizing thedestructive effects of the changes and directing themtowards democratic evolution.The major task of the United Nations remains themaintenance of international peace and security.Furthermore  the principal tools available to theOrganization must be political and diplomatic. I remind theAssembly of this fact because  during the past few yearswithin the United Nations  a “sanctions syndrome” hasbegun to emerge: a desire to apply sanctions and othercoercive measures more broadly and actively  sometimesignoring existing political and diplomatic avenues. We areconvinced that the United Nations should take suchmeasures only in exceptional cases  after all other meanshave been genuinely exhausted.On the whole  there is a need to modernize the UnitedNations sanctions mechanisms. Today  for example  nospecific procedure is provided for lifting sanctions  and  asexperience has demonstrated  this is extremely important.The humanitarian damage caused by sanctions and thedamage to third countries should be minimized.It is extremely important to emphasize that theUnited Nations must be maintained as the soleOrganization that can authorize the use of force. Anyactions of that nature taken in circumvention of theSecurity Council must be totally precluded.The United Nations can and must work purposefullytowards establishing a new global legal framework. Togive impetus to such work Russia has proposed theholding in 1999 of a third peace conference. This ideaalready has the support of a significant number of States.I believe that the time has come to discuss this initiativein a constructive and substantive manner.Past experience shows the need for new approachesby the United Nations to peacekeeping operations. Wecan already discern a pyramid regulating the relations ofthe United Nations with regional organizations. Withoutthe development of such relations the United Nations maynot be able to withstand the burden of peacemakingactions. I refer specifically to a pyramid  because it is offundamental importance to do no harm to the SecurityCouncil  which bears the primary responsibility for themaintenance of international peace.We are counting on significantly more attentionbeing paid by the United Nations to conflicts in the areaof the Commonwealth of Independent States. So far  themajor role in this respect has been played by Russia andits Commonwealth partners.In view of present circumstances  Russia calls on theUnited Nations to address the Afghan conflict. In thatmultinational and long-suffering country  a truly criticalsituation has arisen  and we have to do everythingpossible to prevent the country from disintegrating. TheAfghan tragedy  like the endless series of internalconflicts in Rwanda and Liberia  is the most convincingargument for the development of a United Nations policyof national reconciliation diplomacy.To cope with all these tasks  the United Nationsitself must be updated and adapted to these newconditions. Reform is long overdue  and it is not a singlemeasure that is required but a process that encompassesthe entire United Nations system. Reform of the UnitedNations requires clearly defined goals: first  that it carryout its activities in a timely manner; and secondly  that itsstructure be optimized in order to enhance theeffectiveness of the Organization.16A great deal has already been done to implementreform. The Secretary-General has made a considerablecontribution to these efforts  and Russia supports thecontinuation of this difficult and protracted effort.It is a well-established tradition to conclude statementsbefore this Assembly by saying that the current sessionmust play a special role in strengthening peace and thatpeoples are expecting us to make decisions. I am confidentthat this session of the General Assembly will live up to theexpectations of Governments and the hopes of peoples: thatall of us will take a new step in humankind’s difficulttransition towards a world united in its diversity  a worldthat is open to universal economic and spiritualdevelopment  a world that promises security and stability —a world in which States cooperate on an equal footing. Letus work together for the sake of this goal."
"143",6007,"RWA",51,1996,"﻿Permit me tocongratulate Mr. Razali Ismail on his unanimous electionto preside over this session. His election is a reaffirmationby the United Nations Member States of the confidencethat they have placed in him and in the Government of20Malaysia. In this regard  I should like to assure him of thecooperation of the delegation of the Republic of Rwanda inour shared desire to galvanize the community of nations intheir common resolve to fulfil the objectives of the UnitedNations Charter. I should like to take this opportunity topay tribute to his predecessor  His Excellency Mr. DiogoFreitas do Amaral  for presiding over the fiftieth session ofthe General Assembly in a most efficient and able manner.The session over which Mr. Razali is presiding will beaddressing a considerable agenda of more than 155 items which  when put together  will contribute to world peace security and stability. The United Nations is the mostappropriate forum to discuss these and other related mattersof global peace  development and international cooperation.The agenda before us therefore seeks to address theimplementation of the objectives of the Charter  asenshrined in Article 1.As we move towards the twenty-first century  it is ourindividual and collective responsibility to re-examine theextent to which our countries have or have not contributedto the attainment of these objectives. The United NationsAgenda for Peace and its valuable initiatives onpeacekeeping  human rights and other development-relatedissues — collective security  terrorism  denuclearization conflict prevention and resolution — will be discussedduring the session. Rwanda would like to join its voice tothose of the delegations that spoke from this rostrum andwho called for world peace  security and the developmentof developing countries.Statements have been made from this rostrum inconnection with what some have described as the ghastlyevents that took place in Rwanda in 1994. Many  perhapsinadvertently and in a simplistic manner  have described theevents of 1994 in Rwanda as a conflict  a crisis  ghastlyevents or as gross violations of human rights. There wasgenocide in Rwanda  nothing else but a genocide. It wasnot a tribal or ethnic conflict  as it is often referred to.Between April and July 1994 more than one millionRwandans were butchered in a systematic and plannedmanner. This carnage was carried out in only 98 days. Thedevastating effects of the aftermath of the Rwandangenocide are still with us  and we live with them. Rwanda’spopulation now consists of 70 per cent women  60 per centof whom are widows  and we have 400 000 orphans in thecountry.The perpetrators of the Rwandan genocide are still atlarge in some capitals. Far from feeling remorse  they pridethemselves in their unfinished agenda. Their army  militiaand political leadership are in military and refugee campswithin walking distance of the Rwanda-Zaire border. Theyhave recently stepped up infiltrations into Rwanda inorder to kill the remaining survivors of genocide.We call upon the international community to exertpressure on the Government of Zaire to relocate therefugees away from its borders with Rwanda  inconformity with the 1951 Geneva convention (relating tothe Status of Refugees).The withdrawal of United Nations peacekeepingtroops in April 1994  at the height of the execution of thegenocidal agenda  was not helpful. For us in Rwanda  itremains  and will continue to remain  a reminder of theresponsibility of the United Nations to ensure that thisdoes not reoccur anywhere else. More importantly  itpoints to the need for the United Nations to supportRwanda in its efforts to rebuild its socio-economicinfrastructure. This is critical. There can be no sustainablepeace without reconstruction and development. The recenthigh-level symposium on conflicts in Africa  which washeld in Tokyo this month  on 9 and 10 September  cameto the same conclusion.Allow me to put on record my Government’sappreciation of the efforts made by those countries institutions and humanitarian agencies that helped andcontinue to assist Rwanda in the various sectoralrehabilitation programmes. We are equally grateful tothose who have shown their disposition to do so in thenear future.The recently concluded round table conference which was organized with the support of the UnitedNations Development Programme (UNDP)  has beenhelpful. We are grateful for the commitments that weremade. This will go a long way in assisting Rwanda toconsolidate and build on the achievements of the past twoyears.The Government of National Unity of Rwanda under the leadership of His Excellency President PasteurBizimungu  has made significant strides to return thecountry to normalcy. Tremendous achievements havebeen made  including the gradual and steady rehabilitationof the security structure  the judiciary  the legislature andthe economy. The sound macroeconomic policies thathave been adopted have contributed  in less than twoyears  to a reduction in inflation from 60 per cent in 1994to 10 per cent in 1996. This will drop to 5 per cent by the21end of 1997. Agricultural production has reached 70 percent of the pre-war level  and we have recorded impressivelevels of food production.We are also pleased to inform the internationalcommunity that more than 2.2 million refugees have nowreturned to Rwanda. All Rwandan refugees originally basedin Burundi have been repatriated and successfully resettledin their own communities without incident. This issufficient proof that Rwandan refugees in otherneighbouring countries  apart from being the hostages ofgenocidal leaders in the refugee camps  have no otherreasons to remain.These achievements have been made in spite of somecritical factors that the international community could helpRwanda overcome if we are to maintain the pace of ourcontinuing progress towards stability  durable peace anddevelopment.The crippling debt burden has hamstrung all socialsectors  especially the most vulnerable groups. Children women  widows and the elderly are among the mostaffected. Rwanda’s debt stock at the end of 1995 stood ata staggering high of $1 billion  or 91 per cent of the grossdomestic product (GDP). Most of this  84 per cent  is owedto multilateral institutions; 13 per cent is bilateral; and theremaining 3 per cent is on account of suppliers’ credits.Given the magnitude of this suffocating debt  theGovernment cannot rebuild its shattered socio-economicinfrastructure in the aftermath of genocide. We thereforeurge the international community  and especially themultilateral financial and development institutions  to cancelimmediately Rwanda’s debt. Short of new resources in theform of a Marshall Plan  this cancellation would greatlycontribute to Rwanda’s recovery and sustainable growth.We know very well that where there has been a significantinfusion of financial resources in post-war periods  peaceand stability have been achieved and sustained.The question of conflicts and insecurity in the GreatLakes region has been mentioned by many speakers. Thesituation in Burundi is cause for concern to many especially the countries of the region. I should like in thisregard to commend the efforts of the Organization ofAfrican Unity  the leaders of the region and all those whoare involved in the search for a durable solution.Regional instability has been complicated by thesystematic persecution of Kinyarwanda-speaking Zaireans.This process was stepped up this year with the massacre ofseveral North Kivu region Zaireans of Rwandese culture;others were forced to flee to Rwanda and Uganda. Thispersecution has recently been extended to the South Kivuregion of Zaire  where  again  Kinyarwanda-speakingZaireans have been subjected to brutal attacks by Zaireanforces  along with former Rwanda Government soldiersand interahamwe militias  who did not finish but exportedtheir genocidal and “ethnic cleansing” agenda.Survivors of these attacks — predominantly womenand children  as men and boys are either killed orimprisoned — have been forced to seek refuge inRwanda. It is the responsibility of the Government ofZaire to unconditionally repatriate its nationals who arecurrently living in refugee camps in Rwanda. We callupon the international community to prevail upon theGovernment of Zaire so as to stop the systematic “ethniccleansing” currently taking place in eastern Zaire. Wefurther call upon the Government of Zaire to ceaseimmediately its military aggression which has recentlybeen directed against Rwandan territory.We would like to pay tribute to Mwalimu JuliusNyerere  former President of the United Republic ofTanzania  for his unequivocal and genuine search forsolutions  not only for Burundi  but also within the widercontext of the Great Lakes region.The problem is not the lack of solutions. What islacking is the decisiveness to implement commitmentsvoluntarily entered into. That is what should be addressed.In the case of the Great Lakes region  former PresidentsJulius Nyerere of Tanzania  Jimmy Carter of the UnitedStates of America and General Touré of Mali successfullymanaged to get the Heads of State and Government toagree and sign solemn declarations on the modalities forsolving the problems of the region.At this session  we will be considering there-election of the Secretary-General. My Government’sposition has been clear since Yaoundé  during the summitof the Organization of African Unity. We are notsupportive of the re-election of the incumbent. Doing sowould reward his failure to use the instruments of theUnited Nations Charter in order to come to the rescue ofRwandans during the genocide. Above all  it would beagainst the collective conscience of the Rwandan peopleto support the candidacy of the incumbent. But beyondthese moral grounds  we believe that the election of acontested Secretary-General is not in the interest of theUnited Nations. It would jeopardize the functioning of aninstitution that needs to be strengthened.22"
"144",6051,"SAU",51,1996,"﻿It gives me pleasure  as we begin the work of thissession  to convey to you  Sir  on behalf of the delegationof the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  our sincerestcongratulations on your election to the presidency of thefifty-first session of the General Assembly. Yourassumption of that important position reflects theappreciation of Member States both of your personalqualities and of the positive role your country plays in theinternational arena. We wish you success in fulfilling yourmission and assure you of our readiness and desire tocooperate with you fully in achieving the objectives of thissession.I wish also to take this opportunity to congratulateyour predecessor  Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral  for hiseffective guidance of the affairs of the General Assemblylast session  which witnessed the celebration of the fiftiethanniversary of our Organization.I would also like to convey my sincere appreciation tothe Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. BoutrosBoutros-Ghali  who manages the affairs of this internationalOrganization with exceptional ability and competence ina rapidly changing world. In order to deal with increasingexpectations regarding the present and future role of theUnited Nations  we consider that a renewal of his tenurewill provide him the opportunity to complete ongoingplans and efforts to reform the United Nations and torestore its constructive role in the international arena.A year has passed since we celebrated the fiftiethanniversary of the United Nations. That celebration attended by many world leaders  gave us a valuableopportunity to recall the importance of the role of theUnited Nations in maintaining international peace andsecurity and in enhancing international legitimacy. It alsoprovided us with an opportunity to review theOrganization’s accomplishments and challenges over thepast 50 years.The current session of the General Assembly marksthe beginning of a new era for the United Nations  whichwe hope will witness a consolidation of its role on theinternational scene to the benefit of Member States and inaccordance with the principles and purposes of theCharter. It is our firm belief that this international forumcan play an extremely important and effective role inmanaging crises  in averting wars and conflicts  and inproviding the means for international cooperation. Thisobliges us to be more persistent than ever before insupporting this institution and enhancing its constructiverole.The changes which have occurred in the world overthe past decade are so dramatic that they have created anew international reality with a host of new challenges.These developments offer new opportunities to bolster theprinciples of the United Nations for the benefit ofstrengthening international legitimacy including justiceand equality among nations  the rejection of the use offorce in the settlement of conflicts  the preservation of thedignity of mankind  and providing security and prosperityfor all. We should also recall the fact  to which manyworld leaders referred during the fiftieth anniversarycelebrations  that the ability of this internationalOrganization to resolve global problems  crises andconflicts depends greatly on the political will of MemberStates to abide by the principles of the United Nations. Itis our hope that the future will witness greaterdetermination by Member States to ensure theachievement of the objectives upon which the future ofour Organization depends  a future which is also ours.8The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is fully cognizant of theimportance of reforming United Nations bodies so that theymay fulfil their prescribed roles and deal effectively withthe global changes we have witnessed in recent years.Among these bodies  the Security Council  as the principalorgan directly concerned with the maintenance ofinternational peace and security  remains the focus forreform. My country’s view was and remains that anychanges to the structure of the Security Council should begeared towards enhancing its ability to accomplish its roleeffectively as stipulated in the Charter and to refrain fromany action that would limit its effectiveness in fulfilling itspurposes.Arab leaders  at their summit meeting in Cairo lastJune  expressed their firm commitment to continue thepeace process which they regard as an irreversible strategicgoal. The Cairo meeting reaffirmed that the realization ofa just and comprehensive peace within the realm ofinternational legitimacy presupposes a serious andunequivocal commitment by Israel to abide by theprinciples of the Madrid Peace Conference and SecurityCouncil resolutions 242 (1967)  338 (1973) and 425 (1978) as well as by the land-for-peace formula. The Arab leadersalso reaffirmed that any breach by Israel of these principlesand agreed-upon commitments and agreements  or anydelay in their implementation  would result in a setback tothe peace process  with all its dangerous consequences.We view with great concern the Israeli Government’sfailure to demonstrate a degree of seriousness andcommitment to the peace process comparable to thatdemonstrated by the Arab States. Since assuming office  theGovernment of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hascontinued to issue statements and undertake actions that donot serve the cause of peace. In contrast to the Arab States’commitment to the Madrid principles  to Security Councilresolutions and to the land-for-peace formula  thestatements made by the Israeli Government indicate aninsistence on consolidating of its occupation of Arab lands;maintaining its annexation of East Jerusalem; and delayingthe agreed-upon redeployment of its troops from Al-Khalil.We are also concerned by the Israeli Government’scontinued closure of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip together with its proclaimed rejection of withdrawing fromthe Syrian Golan Heights. Recently  the Israeli authoritiesopened a tunnel under the Al-Aqsa Mosque. This was aflagrant infringement upon the Islamic sanctuaries and aclear violation of binding international resolutions on thestatus of Jerusalem. We welcome Security Councilresolution 1073 (1996)  which the Council issued after theevents that resulted from the Israeli measures. We hope thatthe summit conference sponsored by the President of theUnited States of America will help with theimplementation of that Security Council resolution andgive momentum to the peace process on the basis of thatresolution and in accordance with its principles.Statements by the Israeli Prime Minister that Israelis prepared to resume negotiations without preconditionsare no more than an attempt to distance himself from theMadrid-based principles and fundamentals of the peaceprocess  in particular the land-for-peace formula. Such aposition can only mark a serious setback. Hence  we callupon the United States of America and the RussianFederation  as the co-sponsors of the Madrid PeaceConference  to do their utmost to continue the peaceprocess on all tracks in order to reach the desired results.In this context we value the positive and constructivepositions on this matter reflected in the Florencestatement of the European Union and the Lyon statementof the Group of Seven. Furthermore  we reiterate our callto all parties concerned to fulfil their commitments toprovide economic assistance to the Palestinian people.While we call upon members of the internationalcommunity to increase their economic assistance to thePalestinian Authority  we should remember the need todeal with actions undertaken by the Israeli Governmentwhich might prevent the Palestinians from benefiting fromthis aid. Moreover  any efforts to achieve regionalcooperation will be meaningless and ineffective unlessaccompanied by tangible progress in the peace process onall its tracks.We are greatly concerned about the issue ofJerusalem — Al-Quds Al-Sharif — which is at the heartof the Arab-Israeli conflict and is of utmost concern tothe Arab and Muslim world. The manner in which thisissue is dealt with could determine the future of the peaceprocess. We regret to see the Israeli authorities continuetheir measures aimed at changing the demographiccomposition and creating new realities in the status ofJerusalem with the intention of prejudicing thenegotiations on the final status of the city. We believethat in any settlement of this issue Israel must take intoconsideration internationally binding resolutions legality in particular Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) which calls on Israel to withdraw from occupied Arabterri tories  and 252 (1968) pertaining toAl-Quds Al-Sharif. We also believe that any settlementshould take into account the importance of the repatriationof Palestinian refugees and the release of Palestinianprisoners who have been detained in violation of the9Declaration of Principles  international law and the GenevaConventions.The honourable and firm stand taken by theinternational community following the brutal Iraqiaggression against the State of Kuwait in 1990  includingthe adoption of a series of historic Security Councilresolutions to repel the aggression and restore to the Stateof Kuwait its legitimacy and sovereignty  constitutes thekind of firmness we hope the United Nations will alwaysdemonstrate. The position of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabiaon this issue is unwavering  and is based on twofundamental principles. So long as the Iraqi Governmenthas not fully complied with the internationally bindingdemands set out in Council resolutions  the problem willnot be solved and the suffering of the Iraqi people will notbe mitigated. This is a matter of deep concern for all of us.We believe that recent developments in northern Iraqcould have adverse effects on the unity  sovereignty andterritorial integrity of Iraq  since certain neighbouringcountries have in various ways attempted to interfere in theKurdish conflict. In the light of these realities  we have tobe very careful lest the situation lead to a collapse of theinternational coalition which is responsible for fullimplementation of all relevant Security Council resolutions the foremost of which relate to the release and repatriationof all prisoners of war and detainees from Kuwait and othercountries  the return of stolen assets  compliance with themechanism for compensation  and full cooperation with theefforts of the United Nations Special Commission tooversee the elimination of Iraq’s weapons of massdestruction. These are the objectives the internationalcoalition should strive to fulfil  bearing in mind the need toavoid any measures that might damage the unity sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq.The Government of the Custodian of the Two HolyMosques expressed great interest in efforts to eliminate allweapons of mass destruction from the Middle East including those aimed at keeping that sensitive part of theworld free of nuclear  chemical and biological weapons. Inthis perspective  the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia activelyparticipated in the Review and Extension Conference of theParties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of NuclearWeapons (NPT) held in New York last year  and welcomedthe efforts that have led to an agreement on theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.We believe in the need to make the NPT moreeffective and universal through the activation of thesafeguards system of the International Atomic EnergyAgency. We also see a need to adopt measures andcriteria that would enhance all aspects of the process ofdismantling weapons of mass destruction in accordancewith General Assembly resolution 1 (I)  which addresses inter alia  the issue of eliminating all weapons of massdestruction. In this respect  we urge all States that havenot yet become parties to the Treaty to take the necessarysteps to do so  thus contributing to the maintenance ofworld peace and stability.The occupation by the Islamic Republic of Iran ofthree islands belonging to the United Arab Emirates —Abu Musa  Greater Tunb and Lesser Tunb — is a sourceof great concern  not only to the United Arab Emirates but also to the States of the Gulf Cooperation Council(GCC) as a whole  which desire the best possiblerelations with their neighbour  Iran. We have repeatedlyurged the Islamic Republic of Iran to respond to the callof the United Arab Emirates to settle this long-standingproblem peacefully through serious bilateral negotiations.Consequently  we reiterate our call upon the Governmentof Iran to cease imposing a status quo by force and tohalt preparations for unilateral construction on any of thethree islands. Furthermore  we also call upon theGovernment of Iran to initiate efforts to resolve thisdispute peacefully in accordance with the norms andprinciples of international law  including the referral ofthis matter to the International Court of Justice. In viewof the persistence of the conflict  the Security Councilshould place this issue on its agenda.Based on the determination of the Kingdom of SaudiArabia to maintain the security and stability of theArabian Gulf region  we support the wise actions of theState of Bahrain to foster its security and stability. Theseactions were approved and supported by the GCC and theLeague of Arab States  since the security of the State ofBahrain is part and parcel of the security of theGCC States.Nearly 10 months have passed since the signing ofthe Dayton Agreement  which brought an end to theviolence and destruction that accompanied the Serbaggression against Bosnia and Herzegovina. ThisAgreement did not materialize until the internationalcommunity expressed sufficient will and firmness to stemthe Serb aggression. We hope that the recent electionswill mark a new beginning and a new future of peace stability and economic development for the country.10Nonetheless  we must point out that the peace in Bosniaand Herzegovina will remain fragile until it takes root. Thereconstruction of Bosnia and Herzegovina and theinternational support necessary to help it address theproblems resulting from years of war should be viewed asconditions of peace without which the goals of the DaytonAgreement can never be realized. It is also important toemphasize the need to apprehend and bring to justice theperpetrators of crimes against humanity and to ban themfrom any political office in the future. Their apprehensionis an international responsibility that should not be takenlightly. It is also incumbent upon the internationalcommunity to confront any attempt to divide the countryalong ethnic or religious lines.Helping Bosnia and Herzegovina set out on the roadto peace early this year was the first of a series of positivedevelopments in many troubled areas of the world. Wehope that the recent announcement of an agreementbetween the Government of the Philippines and the MoroNational Liberation Front will mark the end ofconfrontation between the Philippine authorities and theirMuslim minority after a long period of tension and conflict.As for the conflict in Chechnya  we hope the currenttruce and reports of the Russian Government’s intention towithdraw its forces from the area will pave the way for aresolution of this crisis.Unfortunately  the statuses of other conflicts have notchanged. The Pakistani-Indian dispute over Jammu andKashmir is still tense and complicated. There is noalternative to following the peaceful path based on theresolutions of the United Nations guaranteeing the peopleof Jammu and Kashmir the exercise of their right to self-determination.The situation in Somalia remains desperate. Thecountry is awaiting a decision by the clan leaders on aprocess to save the country and its people. We urge allfactions to put aside their differences and shoulder theirnational responsibilities by forming a national authorityrepresenting the different factions of the Somali people inorder to restore unity  stability and security to that country.In Afghanistan — in spite of all the sincere efforts ofthe United Nations and all the good offices of theGovernment of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques toachieve national reconciliation in that country — thefighting still rages between the different factions as a resultof disagreements between their leaders. This has preventedthe country from enjoying the fruits of its victory againstforeign occupation.The issue of international terrorism was the maintopic throughout last year. Many conferences andworkshops addressed ways and means of confronting thisgrowing phenomenon  which has become a source ofgrave concern for the international community. TheKingdom of Saudi Arabia  recognizing the need toconfront and address this serious phenomenon  has voicedits support for all international efforts to confront thisproblem. This position was illustrated collectively in thestatement issued by the Gulf Cooperation Councilfollowing its last session. The GCC States haveemphasized that extremism  violence and terrorism areglobal phenomena that are not limited to a specific peopleor region and have unambiguously denounced andcondemned all forms of violence and terrorism. They alsoexpressed their support for all international efforts aimedat preventing and combating terrorism  including denyingsafe haven to terrorists anywhere and making efforts toapprehend  convict and severely punish those involved insuch crimes.A cursory review of world economic problems andthe role of the United Nations in overseeing internationaleconomic cooperation shows that the success of theUnited Nations in dealing with economic issues andpromoting international development has also been tied tothe commitment of Member States to the United NationsCharter.Although the international community has succeeded by dint of serious negotiations  in resolving many difficultproblems and has achieved important results in manysensitive areas through the establishment of the WorldTrade Organization  we are still concerned by thecontinuing practice of trade protectionism  which runscounter to our belief in the importance of allowing marketforces to play their natural role in economic affairs. It isalso necessary to free international trade from certainrestrictions  such as that of using the pretext of protectingthe environment as a justification for protectionistmeasures. Such restrictions undermine the economies ofdeveloping nations and have a negative impact on theirdevelopment  which is the cornerstone of their peace andstability.The Secretary-General has taken a commendableinitiative in this direction with his “An Agenda forDevelopment”  which  given concerted effort  couldbecome a realistic tool for enhancing global economic and11social development. Here  the developed countries inparticular bear a special responsibility for building fruitfulcooperation to the benefit all countries  rich and poor. Webelieve that an increase in the amount of assistanceprovided by developed to developing countries is acornerstone of such hoped-for cooperation.The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  a founding Member ofthe international Organization and a signatory of the SanFrancisco Charter  is eager to have the United Nationscontinue to play its leadership role in strengtheningcollective security. It reaffirms its responsibilities as afounding Member of the Organization. This reaffirmationwas reiterated in a speech by the Custodian of the TwoHoly Mosques  King Fahd Bin Abdul-Aziz  which wasdelivered on his behalf by His Royal Highness PrinceSultan Bin Abdul-Aziz  Second Deputy Prime Minister andMinister of Defence and Aviation  on the occasion of thefiftieth anniversary of the United Nations. Today  theKingdom of Saudi Arabia takes this opportunity toreconfirm its continued commitment to achieving theobjectives of the United Nations Charter. It will spare noeffort to enhance the capabilities of the United Nations inorder to achieve justice and to promote security  stabilityand prosperity throughout our troubled world.The Holy Koran provides us with guidance to lead ustowards creative actions  as exemplified in the followingverse:“And say: Work righteousness.Soon will God observe your work And His Apostle  and the Believers.'”(The Holy Koran  IX:105)"
"145",6089,"SDN",51,1996,"﻿Allow me at the outset to express to Mr. Razali Ismailour sincere congratulations on his election as President ofthe fifty-first session of the General Assembly. His richexperience  wisdom and knowledge will definitely lead tothe success of our deliberations  which are taking place invery delicate international circumstances. I assure him of15the full support and assistance of my delegation indischarging his task successfully.Allow me also to take this opportunity to express mysincere appreciation to the outgoing President  Mr. Freitasdo Amaral  for his successful efforts in leading the work ofthe fiftieth session of the General Assembly.The international community had keenly hoped thatthe post-cold-war era would result in an end to the tensionsthat had characterized the international scene and to thearms race and armed conflicts. All nations  particularlythose in the developing world  have aspirations to build anew world order whose cornerstone would be equalityamong States  non-interference in their internal affairs transparency and respect for ideological  cultural andreligious diversity.Any observer of today’s international scene wouldconclude that events are completely contrary toexpectations. Tensions have escalated  and political  militaryand economic threats are on the increase. Apparently equality among States of sovereignty  rights and obligationsno longer exists. Moreover  the nuclear threat still lingerson  military conflicts have not ceased and ideologicalfanaticism and cultural hegemony have become the majorfeatures of the new world order.The Sudan is of the view that the structure of theinternational community  which is based on ideological political and cultural diversity and pluralism  prompts us allto accept peaceful coexistence and dictates that harmonyand diversity among nations become the vehicle forinteraction and dialogue within the framework of pursuingnational interests in the context of the international system.The nations of the world expect the United Nations tobe a forum in which they can express their views andpositions and an instrument for the continued pursuit ofhumanity’s aspirations to freedom  prosperity  peace andsecurity.It is against that background that the call has soundedfor the reform of the United Nations system. True andsincere adherence to the spirit and letter of the Charter ofthe United Nations  equality  respect for the sovereignty ofMember States  non-interference in their internal affairs andrespect for their right to choose are the bases forstrengthening the United Nations and fostering its role transparency and democratization  so that it may meet theenormous challenges of maintaining international peace andsecurity and serving economic and social development.I should like to point out that my country hasfollowed with satisfaction the positive reforms that havebeen undertaken by the Secretary-General. The Sudansupports the position expressed by both the League ofArab States and the Organization of African Unityendorsing the re-election of Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghalifor a second term.The Sudan also welcomes General Assemblyresolution 50/227 on the restructuring and revitalization ofthe United Nations in the economic  social and relatedfields. On the other hand  it is imperative that a thoroughreview of the Security Council take place to ensure itsdemocratization and to allow for equitable representationby the developing countries  including permanentmembership. There is a strong need to review the workand procedures of the Security Council in order toachieve transparency and to enable all States to follow theformal and informal meetings of the Council. It is equallyvital that the decision-making mechanism be corrected byestablishing just criteria to guide its policies and distanceit from selectivity and double standards. In this context the veto concept must be reviewed and corrected so thatthe principle of equality among Member States stipulatedin the Charter of the United Nations may become areality.Finally  the Security Council should discharge itspolitical responsibilities without addressing legal issues which fall within the jurisdiction of the InternationalCourt of Justice  as stipulated in the Charter and theStatute of the Court. The Court must be enhanced toenable it to shoulder its responsibilities in handling legaldisputes among Member States.In this connection  it is important to note the newtrend towards the imposition of sanctions against somecountries as a means of settling certain disputes  as hasbeen witnessed recently. Such sanctions have adverselyaffected the people of those countries  particularly thevulnerable sectors of society  namely  women  childrenand the elderly  the very sectors that the United Nationshas pledged to protect and develop. It is thereforenecessary to reconsider the basis on which sanctions areimposed  the duration of such sanctions and the lifting ofthem when the requirements have been met or when theirimplications give rise to human suffering.The ideal means for settling most recent conflicts isthrough strict compliance with the provisions for conflictresolution as stipulated in the Charter  the consolidationof cooperation among States  the encouragement of16dialogue and the fostering of international public opinionthrough common understanding. Therefore  my countrywelcomes the endeavours designed to enhance preventivediplomacy and its mechanisms in order to achieve thesegoals.I wish now to touch upon some important internationalissues. We look forward to the success of the ongoingefforts of the countries of West Africa  under the leadershipof our sister country  Nigeria  to ensure that the people ofLiberia are able to achieve stability. We also hope that theefforts to end the conflict in Angola will stop the bloodshedand steer the country towards development. We also call onthe people of our sister country  Somalia  and the factionsthere  to rise above their differences in order to preserveindependence and unity and resume their march towardsprosperity and progress.We also hope that Rwanda and Burundi will achievestability  and that they will use diversity as an element ofunity and strength. We call for the enhancement andsupport of the role of the Organization of African Unity inits efforts towards settlement of these conflicts. Africa  asthe continent of the future  needs the support of theinternational community so that it can achieve politicalstability and economic development  and contribute toestablishing a more just and stable international community.As for the sanctions imposed on the Libyan people we fully support the Libyan initiatives  which are alsosupported by the League of Arab States and theOrganization of African Unity  to put an end to the conflictbetween Libya and three Western countries. My countryappeals to the international community to exert greaterefforts to reach a final settlement to this dispute and toalleviate the suffering of the Libyan people by ending theembargo to which they are subjected.As for the Middle East  Sudan believes that peaceshould be built on the principles of justice and respect forthe inalienable rights of the Palestinian people and the Arabpeoples in the region  and that peace must also be based onthe commitments agreed to by the parties concerned. Anyretreat from agreed obligations and commitmentscontradicts a real desire to achieve peace.The irresponsible practices of the occupying Powerwill have serious repercussions for the peoples andcountries of the region  and will have a negative effect oninternational peace and security. Therefore  Sudan calls forthe immediate implementation of all relevant SecurityCouncil resolutions in order to achieve a just andcomprehensive peace on all tracks of the process. Wedraw the attention of the international community to theprecarious situation in the region  the consequences ofcontinued failure and the increasing possibilities ofconfrontation  which make it necessary for theinternational community to be vigilant  dynamic and strictin implementing justice and the rule of law so as to savethe region from the potential scourge of war.With regard to the Gulf region  we look forward tothe restoration of the peace and security that it enjoyedbefore to the war. The Sudan would like to reiterate theimportance of compliance with Security Councilresolutions regarding the sovereignty and legitimate rightsto existence of Kuwait  and the rights of its people andleadership with regard to security and stability. Similarly we reiterate the right of Iraq to sovereignty  territorialintegrity and independence. We call upon the internationalcommunity to lift the sanctions imposed on Iraq  whichare causing suffering and starvation for the Iraqi people and  in this respect  we call for the implementation ofSecurity Council resolution 986 (1995).With regard to Europe  my country expresses itssatisfaction with the signing of the Dayton Agreement aimed at ending the suffering of the people of Bosnia andHerzegovina. For several years their suffering causedanguish in the conscience of the international community.We also express our heartfelt congratulations to PresidentAlija Izetbegovic´ for gaining the people’s confidence inhis leadership. We call upon the United Nations to workfor the full implementation of the Dayton Agreement  inparticular the prosecution of Serb leaders responsible forthe crimes of genocide  “ethnic cleansing” and otherviolations of international law. We also call on theinternational community to provide the necessaryassistance and resources for the reconstruction of Bosniaand Herzegovina.With regard to Asia  we express our satisfaction withthe agreement reached between the Government of thePhilippines and the Moro National Liberation Front which reflects the wisdom of both parties. In this context we commend the efforts of President Soeharto ofIndonesia and his Foreign Minister  which culminated inthe agreement.Social and economic development is the primaryrequisite for political stability to deter the scourge of warsand conflicts. In this respect we express the deep concernof Africa  which calls for justice  an end to itsmarginalization  and compensation for all the injustices17inflicted on it during the colonial era and for the inequitiesof the international economic order.The majority of the least developed countries are inAfrica  and they need support and assistance. The debts ofAfrican countries  which exceed $300 billion  have becomethe main impediment to the ambitions of the continent toachieve development and to ensure the prosperity of itspeoples. In most African countries debt-servicing costsexceed the gross national product and total export earnings.The African countries have welcomed the World Bankinitiative to reduce the debt burden of the least developedcountries. Sudan believes that the effective solution of thedebt crisis requires agreement on a unified strategy  withthe aim of cancelling or reducing debts for all thosecountries  without exception. We also call on theinternational community to provide the necessary financialsupport for the Secretary-General’s Initiative fordevelopment in Africa.The mid-term reviews of the Paris Programme ofAction for the Least Developed Countries for the 1990s andof the United Nations New Agenda for the Development ofAfrica in the 1990s have shown that pledges should befollowed by action  not by more promises.In the field of food security and the prevention offamine  which are issues of primary concern to Africa andthe rest of the world  my country places high hopes on theforthcoming World Food Summit  which will take place atRome in November 1996  which will seek solutions for theproblem of food security throughout the world. Sudan which is perceived to be one of the countries with thepotential to play a considerable role in the production offood  is ready to shoulder its responsibility  together with aserious contribution from the international communitytowards that end.Human rights issues have priority on the agenda of theUnited Nations. They receive the full support of mycountry  based on our conviction that human beings are theonly creatures that have been honoured and givenresponsibility by Almighty God  and on our commitment tohuman rights covenants.However  we disagree with the growing tendency toexploit human rights issues to serve the political interests ofcertain circles  in a manner that jeopardizes the principlesof human rights. Selectivity does not serve the cause ofhuman rights as well as objectivity and comprehensiveness;confrontation and condemnation do not support humanrights as well as cooperation  conviction andencouragement.In line with this understanding  my country hasestablished the Advisory Council for Human Rights  toprotect human rights and investigate all accusations andcomplaints in this regard. The Sudan also resumed itscooperation with the Special Rapporteur on human rightsafter the causes of our withdrawal of cooperation hadbeen removed. We reiterate here our commitment tocooperation on this matter  in accordance with theprinciples of objectivity  transparency and respect forcultural diversity and pluralism. This last principleprompts me to refer to the attack on Islam  whichportrays it as barbaric and links it to terrorism. Thesemalicious allegations are unjust; Islam is completelyinnocent. They contravene the principle of respect for allreligions without exception. Wrong practices do notconstitute evidence to justify negative judgements on thereligious beliefs of those who perpetrate them. Suchtrends make all religions and philosophies susceptible tocondemnation  regardless of their sources or origins.Islam is the religion of tolerance and coexistence.We therefore call upon the international community tostop this ferocious campaign targeting Islam  and callupon the United Nations to distance itself from it. Wehope that the positive positions of a number of Westernleaders towards Islam will be echoed by the communitiesin the West  their mass media and their justice systems.I deem it necessary  in addressing the Assembly  toshed light on some important political developments inmy country. I hope members will listen attentively towhat I am about to say and will open their hearts whileI touch on the circumstances that surrounded the adoptionof Security Council resolutions 1044 (1996)  1054 (1996)and 1070 (1996)  respectively  against my country.First  it has been proven that 11 Egyptians were theorganizers and perpetrators of the attempt that was thesubject of these resolutions.Second  prior to the incident the suspects had beenmoving in a number of Arab  African and Asiancountries. The Sudan was but one of these countries.Third  the Security Council has based its resolutionson the statement of the Organization of African Unity(OAU) Mechanism for Conflict Prevention  Managementand Resolution  which called upon the Sudan to look for locate and extradite the suspects if — and I underline18if — they were found in the Sudan. This was stipulated inthe Mechanism’s decision of 19 December 1995.Fourth  those resolutions were based on theassumption that the three suspects  who are Egyptians  werein the Sudan at the time the other members of the groupentered Addis Ababa from other countries  several monthsbefore the incident.Fifth — and this I would underline — no evidencewas produced to prove that the suspects were in the Sudanat the time the incident took place or at the time the Sudanwas asked to hand over the suspects  which request wasreceived more than a month after the incident.Sixth  a secret trial was conducted for the threesuspects  who were sentenced to death. Concerned Statesand observers were never allowed to witness the trial.Seventh  the Sudan has unequivocally condemned thisincident since day one  and it has expressed its readiness tocooperate with the concerned parties.Eighth  the Sudan received the first request to arrestthe suspects 32 days after the incident. The request did notprovide sufficient information about the suspects.Ninth  the competent Sudanese authorities conductedexhaustive and complete investigations  but these did notyield any information or prove the presence of the suspectson Sudanese territory.Tenth  though the Sudan has time and again requestedthe cooperation of concerned countries and of theInternational Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL) inthis regard  its efforts have been in vain.Eleventh  it has been proven that the first suspect is inAfghanistan. An official document confirming that fact wassubmitted to the Security Council by the AfghanGovernment. Moreover  in statements to the press  the firstsuspect claimed full responsibility for the incident andconfirmed that he has not entered the Sudan since 1994.Twelfth  the Sudan reiterates its full readiness tocooperate with all parties concerned  and it emphasizes thatall available evidence indicates that the suspects are notpresent on Sudanese territory.To insist on imposing sanctions on the Sudan defieslogic and justice. This must be reconsidered in order toredress the injustice inflicted on my country and to alleviatethe negative impact of this recurrent series of sanctions which could cause massive human suffering to innocentpeople.As we stated before the Assembly last year  wereiterate our condemnation of terrorism in all its formsand manifestations. We reaffirm our readiness tocooperate and to participate effectively in efforts tocombat terrorism. We are actively involved in this matterat regional levels  in particular within the framework ofthe League of Arab States. We reiterate our commitmentto contribute to the establishment of more secure  stableand just international relations.The Sudan has witnessed a number of internalpolitical developments this year. Parliamentary electionswere held  followed by a presidential election by directballoting. All Sudanese citizens exercised their democraticright in a free and fair election monitored byrepresentatives of friendly countries and international andregional bodies.The genuine efforts my Government has exertedtirelessly in recent years have culminated in the signingof a political charter between the Government and twoimportant rebel factions. In response to the signing of thepolitical charter  other rebel factions joined the peaceprocess  most recently the SPLA  the Popular Movementfor Peace and the Popular Movement for the Liberationof the Sudan.While our charter affirms that shariah and are themain sources of legislation in the country  it allows Statesto promulgate complementary legislation compatible withtheir needs. We in the Sudan recognize cultural diversity.In accordance with our charter  freedom of religiousbelief and the prohibition of forceful conversion to anyreligion or faith are fully granted. We also recognizepluralism. Accordingly  we guarantee the right to religionand belief. No one can be forced to accept any religiousbelief.The Charter ensures the fair distribution of resourcesand power-sharing among citizens. It also calls for theestablishment of a coordination council for the southernstates in order to contribute to the implementation of theprovisions stipulating the holding of a comprehensivereferendum among the citizens of southern Sudan after aninterim period  the length of which has yet to benegotiated.19Relentless efforts are being made in order to reach asettlement with the faction that has thus far remainedoutside of the peace process. Consultations and coordinationare currently under way with the concerned parties  inparticular with the countries of the region represented in theInter-Governmental Authority on Drought and Development(IGADD).The Sudan welcomes and appreciates the contributionby friendly countries towards our sincere and genuinesearch for lasting peace in our country. I am pleased toinform members of the Khartoum agreement  signedbetween the Sudan and Uganda through the kind and muchappreciated mediation of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Thisagreement was further strengthened by the conclusion inTehran last week of an agreement on a verificationmechanism for the implementation of the agreement  withthe participation of Iran and Malawi.At this juncture  as I speak of Sudan’s greatest andmost urgent priority — peace — I wish to pay tribute tothe intensive intellectual efforts being exerted by the UnitedNations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization(UNESCO)  within its specific mandate in the UnitedNations system and by all ways and means available to it to establish a culture of peace. This is based on theconstruction in the minds of men in defence of peace  asstipulated in the preamble of UNESCO’s statute.My Government has fully cooperated with UNESCOin the promotion of the noble objectives of this programme.We did so notably through our contribution to the 1995Barcelona conference and to the follow-up seminar in theNetherlands in May 1996. We sincerely hope that suchdialogue will continue  with a view to creating anenvironment conducive to achieving a comprehensivepeace.For more than three decades  my country has hostedover a million refugees from neighbouring countries as aresult of the unstable security situation in those countries.We have provided them security and stability as well aseducational  health and other essential services. In theframework of solving the refugee problem throughvoluntary repatriation  the Sudan has cooperated with theOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner forRefugees (UNHCR) and other concerned countries  and hassigned tripartite agreements for the repatriation of therefugees from some of those countries. We hope to reachsimilar agreements concerning the rest of the refugees  thusguaranteeing their repatriation in dignity.We call upon the international community to sharethis burden with the Government of the Sudan. As theSudan is experiencing severe economic difficulties  theresources allocated to refugee programmes havediminished considerably. This has resulted in severepressures on Sudan’s public sector  since the refugeesshare food and services with Sudanese citizens.Aware of its responsibilities towards its people  theSudan has sought to deliver food and other reliefassistance to its war-affected populations throughout thecountry  including in areas controlled by the rebels.Based on this understanding  the Sudan initiated theidea of Operation Lifeline Sudan (OLS) and hasconsistently urged its implementation in cooperation withthe United Nations. A number of General Assemblyresolutions have commended the full cooperation betweenthe Sudan and the United Nations in this Operation. Thepractical implementation of OLS has yielded a number ofimportant observations  which we will submit to thereview meeting scheduled this month in the hope of anadequate response. We urge and hope that the next phaseof OLS will see a fairer distribution of relief supplies andthat it will contribute further towards the development andrehabilitation process  thus promoting an environmentconducive to peace and stability.In spite of these observations  I should like toexpress the full commitment of the Government of theSudan to cooperation with the United Nations in theimplementation of the objectives of Operation LifelineSudan in accordance with the principles of neutrality transparency and respect for the sovereignty of mycountry.As mankind approaches the dawn of the newcentury  we hope that the United Nations will be itsvehicle and bridge to a world in which hope  peace andjustice will prevail. Let us unite our wills and harmonizeour ideals towards the achievement of this nobleobjective."
"146",6134,"SEN",51,1996,"﻿Your noteworthy election  Sir  to the presidency of theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-first session is an eloquentand solemn tribute from the Members of our Organizationto your great country  Malaysia. Your intellectual and moralqualities  your faith in the United Nations and your vastexperience in international relations guarantee  in our view success in the work of this session. For all these reasons Senegal  which enjoys a strong relationship of friendshipand cooperation with your country  is happy to convey toyou  through me  warm congratulations. We assure you ofour full support in the achievement of the lofty missionentrusted to you.To your predecessor  His Excellency Mr. DiogoFreitas do Amaral  I wish to express our profound gratitudefor the effectiveness  competence and the commitment withwhich he discharged his mandate during a historic andparticularly productive session.I would also like to pay tribute to the Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  at thisfifty-first session of the General Assembly. Mr. BoutrosBoutros-Ghali is an ardent champion of peace andcooperation among peoples  and his commendable work forthe United Nations should be emphasized today  toencourage perseverance along this path. Moreover  theAfrican Heads of State recently adopted at Yaoundé astatement recommending his re-election to a second term ofoffice as United Nations Secretary-General.The international climate today strikes us as one ofthose special situations that should awaken ourconsciences  inviting us to enhance our efforts and clarityof vision to ensure humanity a future of peace  solidarityand cooperation.Indeed  we are meeting at a time conducive to majorchanges in the life of our Organization. The most strikingillustration of our common desire for reform wasexpressed here last year  during the solemncommemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the UnitedNations. It was in that spirit that during thecommemorative meeting of the General Assembly someof the most authoritative voices in the world — those of128 Heads of State and Government — forcefullyreaffirmed their profound faith in the United Nations  itsprinciples and objectives.Furthermore  these leaders unanimously called forin-depth reflection so that we might enter the twenty-firstcentury with a restructured  reinvigorated Organization equipped with the necessary human  material and financialresources to more effectively accomplish the lofty missionof an Organization that harmonizes the complementaryefforts of Member States in order to achieve new goals ina context of freedom and active solidarity.Guaranteeing peace and collective security;developing friendly relations among nations based onshared values; promoting respect for human rights andfundamental freedoms; and developing varied forms ofcooperation in the economic  social  cultural andhumanitarian fields — these were the dreams of thosewho  50 years ago  created the United Nations. They arestill today the foundation  the moral basis and thejustification for the objectives we must continue to pursuein these final years of the twentieth century  a centurythat  despite two world wars  was one of prodigiousdiscoveries — a century that saw man walk on the moon explore the environs of Mars and make significantprogress in combating disease.However  we must agree that today’s world is notthe world of 50 years ago. This one presents new andwidespread dangers but also offers different possibilities.We must therefore close ranks  minimize our differencesand combine our efforts  as peoples  nations  States andcommunities.Today  all nations face an enormous paradox: on theone hand  countries have never been closer to one anotherdue to the increasing globalization of technology; on the8other hand  the fragmentation of nationalities has triggeredthe resurgence of new forms of confrontation and conflict as well as misunderstandings and serious delays in theevolution of continents.During the cold-war period  it was generallyconsidered that the main threats to peace would come fromwars between States  and the greatest fear was that anuclear conflict would break out and devastate the planet.The end of the cold war gave rise to a sense of trustin the advent of a world free from the spectre of a nuclearcataclysm  which we welcomed with optimism. We sharedthe belief that the many regional conflicts could be resolvedquickly once they were no longer fuelled by unbridledmilitary assistance and by positions of continual escalationin both hemispheres.Today  unfortunately  we are forced to recognize thatthe state of the world for the most part belies theseoptimistic visions; many old conflicts continue to resist theinternational community’s attempts to settle them.Pernicious and persistent intra-State conflicts have brokenout. The conflicts in Africa and in the former Yugoslaviaillustrate this situation.Indeed  from Angola to Somalia  from Burundi andRwanda to Liberia  Africa is beset by conflicts whosenature  as we are forced to recognize  prevents the properand effective implementation of the solutions proposed.It is true that significant progress has been made insome of these conflicts  particularly in Angola and to alesser extent in Rwanda. We need to continue our efforts inthis direction.In other conflicts  the road to peace remains uncertain.In Liberia  the situation is extremely murky due to thedifficulty of managing conflicts between rival factions despite the initiatives of the United Nations  theOrganization of African Unity (OAU) and the Africancountries in the area.However  we must not become discouraged. At therecent Ministerial meeting in Abuja  Nigeria  the membercountries of the Economic Community of West AfricanStates (ECOWAS) took some courageous decisions. These we hope  will create new conditions conducive to thenormalization of the situation in that country through theorganization of free and democratic elections  with the fullsupport of the entire international community.Turning to Burundi  it is clear that the measuresprescribed by the United Nations and by the OAU havenot managed to end the bloodshed  nor did they preventthe military coup de force of 25 July last. This isregrettable and we must take action.However  we must not lose faith. Given this newsituation  Senegal  like the African countries of the GreatLakes region  calls for the restoration of constitutionalorder and reaffirms its conviction that any solution to thecrisis in Burundi requires the initiation — despite anyfeelings of resentment — of a free and transparentdialogue in good faith between the various parties to theconflict.In Europe  the former Socialist Federal Republic ofYugoslavia represented  before it was torn apart  asuccessful example of a pluralistic and harmonious ethnicand religious coexistence  which was the pride of theworld. It was in the name of these values that  from thebeginning of the conflict  Senegal rejected any notion ofpartitioning Bosnia and Herzegovina  and that is why itwelcomed with great hope the signing of the DaytonAgreement. It is in this spirit that the momentum forpeace of this Agreement must be consolidated.In this regard  the smooth conduct of the elections of14 September was an important step. The prosecution arrest and sentencing of war criminals by the internationalcriminal Tribunal remains a major test for theinternational community. More than that  is it a matter ofproving that our community is able to implement SecurityCouncil decisions.Against this background  Senegal  my country  willcontinue  as it has in the past  to do what it can within theframework of the Contact Group of the Organization ofthe Islamic Conference (OIC) to bring about the advent ofa Bosnia and Herzegovina at peace with itself  so that theseeds of peace and stability can finally bear fruit in thiswar-torn land and throughout the rest of the formerYugoslavia.Exactly one year ago we welcomed with relief thesigning of the Washington and Taba agreements —important milestones for the establishment of peace andreconciliation between the peoples of the Middle East.The door thus opened must never close again. Today regrettably  doubts and the fear of returning to a pastmarked by war and hatred are beginning to resurface. Letus put an end to these threats while there is still time.9While my country has always believed  and continuesto believe  that some realities are inescapable — theexistence of Israel is one of them — it is also of theopinion that the security of that State can  in the long term be assured only in the framework of respect for  andimplementation of  the current peace process  which shouldlead to the definitive creation of a sovereign andindependent Palestinian state  a fully-fledged member of theinternational community.It is therefore up to the new Israeli Government elected in May 1996  to make decisive efforts so that theflame of peace  ignited just recently with such courage andclear-sightedness  continues to inspire the leaders andpeoples of Israel and Palestine towards a Middle East thatbuilds its future on a spirit of solidarity  cooperation andfriendship.Given the changes in the world since the fall of theBerlin Wall and given the new types of conflicts  whichrequire a new approach to the management of our collectivesecurity system  our Organization  the United Nations  mustbe understood  supported and strengthened.Increasingly  the United Nations has been called on tocreate a new generation of peacekeeping operations. TheBlue Helmets have been joined by civil experts whoprovide political  economic  social and humanitarianassistance  thus contributing to the stabilization of situationsand conflicts as well as to the search for a politicalsettlement to conflicts through national reconciliationwhenever necessary.Accordingly  my country  Senegal  will continue totake part with resolve in this noble mission in the serviceof peace  with the conviction that has always inspired ourinternational policy. This same desire prompted itsparticipation  with 36 other countries  in the standby forcessystem initiated recently by the Secretary-General  as wellas its commitment to the establishment of an early warningand rapid reaction system.Guided by these same principles  Senegal continues tomake a modest contribution to the attainment of the goal ofcomprehensive and effective disarmament. Senegal’s recentadmission to the Conference on Disarmament  when thatbody was expanded  attests to its will to work together withall peace-loving nations to build a better future in a worldfree from weapons of mass destruction.In this respect  I wish to welcome warmly theagreement concluded here on the indefinite extension of theTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons particularly since it meets the concerns of all MemberStates of our Organization  specifically the African States.In a spirit of remarkable unanimity  African States signedin Cairo last March the Pelindaba agreement on thedenuclearization of the continent.In the same spirit  the international communityrecently took an important step to halt the nuclear armsrace with the adoption by the General Assembly on 10September 1996 of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-BanTreaty  which my country has just signed on 26September 1996  here in New York.However  it is a fact that at a time when theinternational community faces new challenges stemmingfrom the end of the cold war  our Organization willincreasingly be asked to play a more central role in worldaffairs. Naturally this means that meaningfulimprovements must be made in the work of theOrganization; most importantly  the principle ofuniversality should be implemented methodically andeffectively. Accordingly  the restructuring anddemocratization of the Security Council must remain apriority goal. This central body of the United Nationsmust reflect in its decision-making process the concernsof the entire membership of our Organization. Its reformmust lead to increased transparency and a betterrepresentation by all regions of the world.Guided by the ideal of the universality of the UnitedNations  Senegal supports the request of the Republic ofChina to be admitted to membership in our Organization and  generally speaking  to membership in the specializedagencies of the United Nations system. It is inarguable  inour opinion  that that State  in view of its socio-economicperformance  its development level  its commitment todemocratic values and its behaviour in internationalaffairs meets all the criteria and conditions set forth bythe Charter of the United Nations for admission tomembership. This admission to membership  should itoccur  would make an important contribution tostabilizing international relations in that part of Asia andwould allow for an unprecedented economic  technicaland cultural cooperation among the countries of South-East Asia and Africa. Its admission would in no wayjeopardize the efforts made by the internationalcommunity for peace and development in the world.The values of peace  freedom and economic andsocial justice  which 50 years ago inspired the creation ofour Organization  must now more than ever remain the10basis of our common action towards a life of dignity for all.The post-cold-war experience has taught us once again thatthe many facets of underdevelopment remain a seriousthreat to international peace and security.Now that globalization and interdependence arephenomena recognized by all  we must understand that thedestiny of humankind is one and indivisible. This obvioustruth must persuade us to seek  in a spirit of solidarity  jointsolutions to the persistent problems of underdevelopment.The series of major world conferences set to conclude nextNovember with the World Food Summit — a positiveinitiative welcomed by my country — is an encouragingsign of the international community’s resolve to meet thesechallenges in the best interests of the peoples of the world on the basis of a comprehensive  integrated approach tohuman development.We need now to maintain and strengthen that spirit bymobilizing additional financial resources  without which thecommitments undertaken will remain a dead letter  whichwould betray the legitimate hopes to which they gave rise.We must find an early and comprehensive solution to thesevere debt crisis. The components of the problem are fairlyclear today. The sustained structural-adjustment effortsmade by our country will remain futile and ineffective ifexternal factors such as the debt burden and thedeterioration of the terms of trade continue seriously tohinder our development prospects.The Agenda for Development gives us a newopportunity to reaffirm our commitment to world peace andstability by defining a comprehensive framework for actionbased on economic justice  social well-being  the protectionof human rights and the preservation of the environment.The development of Africa  and I cannotoveremphasize this point  is the primary responsibility ofthe Africans themselves. That is why in many Africancountries today Governments continue with determinationto carry out bold and difficult reforms  reflected  inter alia in the improved and more rational use of public funds  inthe opening of our economies to international trade and inthe creation of conditions conducive to private enterpriseand to the transparent management of public affairs with most importantly  all sectors of society participating in thework of national development  in the interests of all. In thisregard  we must pay tribute to the Bretton Woodsinstitutions  the World Bank and the International MonetaryFund for the assistance and support they have extended toour countries. For these ongoing efforts to be successful they must be supported by increased official developmentassistance  substantial debt relief and by the lifting ofbarriers and other protectionist measures. These threeareas require dynamic action on the part of theinternational community.Senegal is firmly convinced that we can combatAfrican pessimism if we are resolved jointly to promotea mutually beneficial partnership for the recovery of anAfrica with enormous potential  which  if tapped  wouldoffer our partners real opportunities. It was thisconviction  let us recall  that prompted the Head of Stateof Senegal  His Excellency Mr. Abdou Diouf  to take theinitiative during his first term of office as ActingChairman of the Organization of African Unity  to requestthe convening for the first time of a special session of theGeneral Assembly to discuss the economic situation inAfrica. That is the light in which my country sees the twoinitiatives devoted to Africa: the United Nations NewAgenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s andthe Special Initiative for Africa  launched by theSecretary-General in March 1996.Furthermore  we noted that the mid-term review ofthe United Nations New Agenda for the Development ofAfrica at this session gave a very frank assessment ofwhat must be done to make this project a genuineframework for multilateral cooperation and a source ofinspiration for a fruitful partnership for development.In conclusion  I should like to touch on the UnitedNations financial crisis  which has become a source ofmajor concern for all our States. Since the causes of thesituation have been discussed at length in this very Hall I do not believe it is necessary to recall them. However one thing is very clear. At a time when our Organizationis committed on several fronts  both to restoring peaceand to strengthening its role as the primary frameworkand instrument for the advent of the new world order  itsfinancial stability is essential to enable us jointly to meetthe major challenges ahead.Therefore  my country  Senegal  would like onceagain to appeal to all Member States regularly to meettheir financial obligations. In this regard  it is essentialthat the credibility of the United Nations not be impugnedat a time when  individually and collectively  we havesuch high hopes for the future of humankind.Once again  the effectiveness of the United Nationswill depend upon our common resolve to harmonize ourown interests to achieve our shared goals in strict11accordance with the fundamental principles of the SanFrancisco Charter.As our President  His Excellency Mr. Abdou Diouf has said repeatedly  Senegal will continue  as it has in thepast  to work tirelessly for the attainment of the ideals ofpeace  justice and solidarity  and to reaffirm and seekcompliance with all the principles on which a trueinternational community  sharing a common destiny  isbased."
"147",6181,"SGP",51,1996,"﻿Last year we met in acelebratory mood. But after every party comes the soberdawn  and we now face the sombre reality that the UnitedNations risks marginalization. Its role in the twenty-firstcentury is not to be taken for granted.The sad truth is that today the United Nations playslittle or no practical role in the management of the mostimportant political  strategic and economic questions of ourtime. But this was not always the case as we recall: theUnited Nations played a significant role in easing the pangsof decolonization. Even at the height of the cold war  theUnited Nations was not an unimportant instrument throughwhich the super-Powers could manage regional proxyconflicts and  on occasion  even direct nuclearconfrontation.This contrast with its past should lead us to regard thepresent and future of the United Nations with deep concern.We can no longer postpone a critical examination offundamental issues. It is for this reason that my delegationis especially gratified to see Malaysia occupy thepresidency of the General Assembly at this importantturning point for the future of the United Nations. We inthe Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)know Tan Sri Razali Ismail for his commitment and clearthinking.I can do no better than echo what you  Mr. President said about reform in the first plenary meeting of theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-first session; we entirely agreewith you. The interminable debates about the need forUnited Nations reform have led to precious little realreform. These debates have served to conceal and not toclarify basic issues. An important theme has been the needfor greater efficiency; we all support that. No one canseriously argue against more productivity  bettermanagement and less waste. The key question  however  is:efficient to do what?What kind of United Nations do we really want andfor what purposes? We all know that the purposes of theUnited Nations are enshrined in the very first Article ofthe Charter. Nevertheless  the answers are not self-evident. We all know that the first of the United Nationspurposes is“To maintain international peace and security”.But what does this mean? The more extravagant post-coldwar hopes for a new Agenda for Peace have provedillusory. The failure of the United Nations ProtectionForce (UNPROFOR) raises troubling questions about therole of the United Nations after the cold war. Theessential lesson to be drawn from UNPROFOR’s fate isnot merely how the Security Council became a politicaltheatre to assuage the domestic concerns of some of itsprincipal members; nor is it only the truism that theUnited Nations could do no more than what its principalmembers allowed it to do. The real tragedy for the UnitedNations in Bosnia is that when the major Powers finallydecided to get serious about what they determined to bea threat to international peace and security  their preferredinstrument was clearly not the United Nations.Again  we all agree that poverty breeds conflict  andthat the gap between the rich and poor is widening. Yetthe Agenda for Development has been mired intheological arguments about the definition of sustainabledevelopment. Now I do not mean to suggest that clarityof objectives is unimportant. But the real issues are notthat complicated  because what the least developed mosturgently need is not intellectual sophistry but help: helpto build the institutions and formulate the policies thatwill allow them to plug into the global economy. TheUnited Nations has not adequately met these challenges.The stalemate in reform is not merely because of thedifficulty of the questions or because of conflictinginterests. Of course  the issues are thorny and differencesin interests inevitable in any system of sovereign States.That is precisely why we need the United Nations  as theCharter envisages  “to be a centre for harmonizing theactions of nations”.Why then is the United Nations today less able toperform this vital function? In my view  it is because ithas been reluctant to adequately confront the implicationsof the two most significant developments of our time.First  the end of the cold war and  secondly  theemergence of a truly global world economy. Theconjunction of these two events is changing the mannerin which States relate to each other in unprecedented andfundamental ways. Yet these developments are at best12only imperfectly reflected in the United Nations. And anyinternational organization that divorces itself frominternational realities has no future.The most obvious consequence for the United Nationssince the end of the cold war has been the great increase inmembership. But the change in the nature of Members hasoccasioned less comment. In 1945  small States  which Idefine as those having a population of 10 million or less formed 59 per cent of a United Nations with 51 Members.Half a century later  in 1995  small States by the samedefinition formed the same percentage of a United Nationsof 185 Members. And 23 of the 26 countries — more than88 per cent — that joined the United Nations after 1989were also small States. I expect that when the UnitedNations membership expands further  as it surely must  themajority of new Members will also be small States.This is because changes in the structure of theinternational economy engendered by technologicaladvances and the end of the cold war have made size lessimportant in the determination of a country’s viability.What matters most today is not merely the extent of aState’s frontiers or the wealth of its resources; the key isthe ability of a State to integrate itself as part of a network and size is irrelevant to this.The most important international networks are notcomposed of relations between States. The critical networksare increasingly defined by transnational patterns ofrelationships between cities  regions and subregions thatmay only imperfectly fit in with the formal politicalboundaries of individual States. This again makes acountry’s size or its resources less important than its abilityto access these networks.It is a fact that many small countries are also amongthe less developed. This is not surprising given the skeweddistribution of international wealth. But the significant pointis that to be small is no longer an automatic or fataldisability. It can even be advantageous. This hasemboldened many to seek self-determination. And since thesame trends have loosened the ability of capitals to controltheir peripheries  many have succeeded.Where economics leads  politics inevitably follows.Paradoxically  the political consequence of increasingeconomic integration of a globalized world economy is acertain loosening of political bonds. We see the effects ofthis most dramatically in the physical breakup of large anddiverse States. But these are exceptional situations. Evenwhen  as is more usual  the formal political boundariesremain intact  the ability of capitals of large and relativelyhomogeneous States to impose a single direction over alltheir constituent parts is clearly diminishing. Power isdevolving everywhere. This trend is a new internationalreality.I do not wish to overstate the argument. So long assovereignty remains the chief organizing principle of theinternational system  the exercise of force cannot bediscounted in inter-State relations. In war  size is notentirely irrelevant  even though technology has made itsomething less than the totally decisive factor it was inthe past. But war is an extreme condition of internationalrelations. Under normal conditions  the very notions ofpower and wealth are being redefined and becoming morediffuse  their different dimensions less prone to befocused in just a few world capitals. Hierarchy is still afact of international life. But what does it really mean tobe a “great Power” at the end of the twentieth century?The very phrase today sounds anachronistic.Bereft of a simple strategic enemy  the post-cold-warforeign policy decision-making of the major Powers isincreasingly localized  with domestic politics exercisinggreater impact. The policies of big Powers in a globalizedworld  where the economic and other interests of theircomponent parts may be at odds with those of the capital is becoming less coherent. The very notion of a singlenational interest is becoming somewhat ambiguous.All this is making it increasingly difficult for eventhe biggest countries to routinely bring their power tobear in an interdependent world  where an attack on anopponent may well damage their own interests. Wieldingpower is becoming more unpredictable even for thosewho control its greatest instruments. It is not an accidentthat the big Powers are now somewhat more cautiousabout exercising power nakedly save in exceptionalcircumstances and against States that are marginal in theglobal economy.I do not mean to suggest that the traditional notionof international relations structured by the interactions ofa few big Powers pursuing their individual nationalinterests is entirely obsolete. But it is surely an inadequatedescription of the world today. The balance of militarypower is still important. But the strict distinction betweenhigh politics and low politics on which the traditionalbalance of power rested is increasingly blurred.Now  all this ought to make a consultative multilateral process more attractive to everyone  and not13less attractive. Alas  this is not so. Herein lies the root ofthe problems of the United Nations. All States  big andsmall  are adjusting to the changing international system.Indeed they have no choice. But not all are choosing to doso in or through the United Nations. In the United Nations most of the Powers that we traditionally designate as“great” have reacted with varying degrees of disquiet tothese new international realities.Some  troubled by their decreasing ability to controlevents even within their own frontiers  are frustrated at theirinability to impose their order on what is perceived as arecalcitrant  unfamiliar and intrusive Organization. Otherssee a threat to their position and prestige. Psychologicaladjustments are always the most difficult to make. It is thusnot surprising that in the United Nations their reflexreaction has generally been a stubborn defence of the statusquo.In discussions on United Nations reform  this simplefact is all too often obscured by the use of arcane andconvoluted jargon. I am encouraged  Mr. President  by yourreputation for plain speaking  for pulling aside the veil ofrhetoric and letting the truth be known. If the UnitedNations is to be marginalized  let the responsibility clearlybe seen to lie where it should. This is most evident in thetwo most critical and inter-related areas: Security Councilreform and finance.Discussions on Security Council reform haveemphasized the Council's size and composition  and inparticular the possibility of the admission of new permanentmembers. There is a wide consensus that in the event thatthere should be agreement for an increase in the permanentmembership  an increase only by industrialised countrieswould be unacceptable. Many countries agree that Japanand Germany should become new permanent memberswhen consensus is reached on the expansion of the SecurityCouncil. Nevertheless  crucial ambiguities remain aboutwhether new permanent members should have the veto. Itis especially difficult to imagine major Powers allowingdeveloping countries the veto over their policies. Andtherefore the stalemate continues.There is also widespread agreement that SecurityCouncil reform should comprise a comprehensive packagethat would include changes in the working methods of theSecurity Council in the direction of greater transparencyand participation by the membership of the Organization asa whole. But the permanent members have been reluctantto admit any but the most cosmetic of changes to theSecurity Council’s working methods. Yet this is the mostcritical aspect of Security Council reform for the smallStates which form the majority of United NationsMembers. Small countries do not aspire to permanentmembership. But as the principal organ for themaintenance of international peace and security  theSecurity Council’s working methods and its decision-making processes are of vital and legitimate interest tothem because they can have direct a impact on theirsecurity.One of the most important and innovative proposalscurrently on the table is for a reinterpretation of Article31 of the Charter. This would allow greater participationby non-members in informal Security Councilconsultations when questions affecting them are beingconsidered. It was extremely discouraging that thismodest proposal was categorically rejected by almostevery permanent member. Indeed  most refused even toseriously discuss it. It must surely be a basic principle ofelementary justice that parties most directly affected by aparticular situation should be allowed to present theirviews directly to the body that will have the mostinfluence over any action that the United Nations maytake on that situation. That is in fact the precise reasonwhy Article 31 was included in the Charter in the firstplace. The intention was clearly to reconcile great-Powerleadership with the principle of sovereign equality.Informal consultations are an innovation that hasevolved over the years. All the most important decisionsthe Security Council takes today are made informally bypermanent members. Even the participation of non-permanent members in the real decisions is sometimesmore symbolic than significant. Formal meetings areclearly only a choreographed ritual to set the final seal ofapproval. A reinterpretation of Article 31 would notrequire an amendment to the Charter  nor would it meanthat non-members must participate in all informalconsultations. It is therefore no real threat to the authorityof the permanent members; it is just an important reformthat would undoubtedly enhance the legitimacy  and hencethe general acceptability and effectiveness  of SecurityCouncil decision-making by bringing the process more intune with the temper of our times.I do not wish to be misunderstood. I am notsuggesting that the size and composition of the SecurityCouncil are unimportant. I understand the merit of theclaims for new permanent membership that have beenadvanced by both industrialized and developing countries.Singapore supports the expansion of the Security Councilby up to five new permanent members as part of a14comprehensive package that would  among other things include the consequent adjustment of non-permanentmembership to maintain a balanced ratio. But given theprofound changes in international relations that are underway  refusing to seriously discuss anything but membership and even that with critical ambiguities  would be akin totrying to prepare the United Nations for the twenty-firstcentury by applying a nineteenth-century model of great-Power politics to it.The same resistance to seriously engaging thelegitimate interests of the small-State majority of UnitedNations Members also underlies the financial problems ofthe United Nations. No one disagrees that the key reasonfor the cash flow problems of the United Nations is thefailure of Member States to pay their dues in full and ontime.There are various reasons why various Member Stateshave not met their legal obligations. Some are poor. But noone has ever suggested that the largest debtor lacks thecapacity to pay. Its argument is that its assessedcontributions must be reduced because the state of itsdomestic political consensus does not permit it to sustain itscurrent share of the United Nations budget. The financialburdens  it is consequently argued  ought therefore be morewidely spread. I do not lightly dismiss such arguments.They reflect the increasing difficulty of defining andexercising great power that I had earlier called one of thenew international realities. I can therefore sympathize withsuch arguments. But it is not politically acceptable to pickand choose which of the new realities to emphasize whenuseful  and which to ignore when inconvenient.Several permanent members have complained of thefinancial burdens they bear  and have sought to spread themmore widely. But there has never been any suggestion byany of the big Powers that their control over critical UnitedNations expenditure decisions  in particular peacekeepingexpenditures  should be proportionately diffused among themajority of small countries which would be expected totake up the financial slack that they want to discard. All thepermanent members have been reluctant to allow anythingmore than the most superficial reexamination of theirauthority or their relationship with the membership as awhole. Discussions on the role of the General Assembly which is the only universal and truly representative UnitedNations organ  have touched mainly on peripheral issues such as the timing of plenary meetings  the duration of thegeneral debate and the organization of the GeneralAssembly’s work.No one should disagree that to put the UnitedNations on a sound financial basis ought to be a commonendeavour. We certainly do not. But it must really be acollective enterprise involving fair give and take. Politicalresistance coalesces because it has become clear that themajority are expected to give  while the few only take.Resistance is underscored by the historical fact that thepercentage financial contributions of all permanentmembers  except France  have been steadily reduced overthe years while their privileges have not. Resistance isstrengthened by the recollection that the United Nationshas in fact repeatedly made the financial adjustmentsasked for  but as yet without any appreciable change inthe payment record of the largest contributor.I do not suggest that this situation is the result of adeliberate policy  since no country takes any pleasure inbeing unable to pay its dues for whatever reason. But itis politically incongruous and basically unfair to ask themajority to assume a greater share of the financialburdens without at the same time being prepared to allowthem any more authority over the most importantexpenditure decisions. It is untenable to have an almosttotal separation between the authority for launchingpeacekeeping operations and how and who should pay forthem. The United Nations is the only organization inwhich a small number of Members run up the largest billswhile everybody else pays them.The stubborn defence of the status quo is all themore striking because no one has asked for anything morethan the most modest and incremental adjustments to therelationship between the General Assembly and theSecurity Council to allow the general membership a littlegreater participation in and shared responsibility for thedecision-making with the greatest budgetary implications.Singapore is  of course  a small State  and I do notclaim to be a disinterested party. As a small State  we arepassionately concerned about and vitally engaged in thefuture of the United Nations. However  our drawingattention to the real obstacles to reform is not just in theinterests of small countries alone.I have suggested that the paradoxical politicalconsequence of a globalized world economy is a certainenhancement of centrifugal tendencies everywhere. Auniversal international organization to play an integrativerole is therefore needed by everyone  big and small  ifthis is not to lead to conflict. Only the United Nations canplay this role  and if it did not exist  we would have hadto invent it. But the United Nations can play this15integrative role only if the legitimate aspirations of thesmall States are not ignored and if the majority do notbecome increasingly alienated from the very Organizationthat purports to represent them.Some may dismiss the distance between the rhetoricand the reality of the big-Power attitude towards UnitedNations reform as simple hypocrisy. I do not accept such asimplistic explanation. I can empathize with the far morecomplex and wrenching psychological adjustments that thebig Powers need to make. The big Powers must summonthe political courage to begin this process and embrace thereality of  and necessity for  change. I appeal to them towork with us  the small-State majority  to make this trulya United Nations for all — all — its Members.Prestige does not depend solely on privilege  andpower shared is not power lost. The new internationalrealities are making a zero-sum conception of State powerobsolete. A credible United Nations  one that is notregarded as the mere tool of its largest Members  will be amore effective instrument for the foreign policies of all itsMembers  big and small.In closing  let me say that my delegation looksforward to close collaboration with you  Sir  and all othermembers over the next year to advance a collective visionof a truly representative  effective and united UnitedNations for the twenty-first century."
"148",6214,"SLB",51,1996,"﻿As we begin thesecond half of the United Nations first century  we arepresided over by a diplomat whose distinguished careerhas included service in four of the world’s five greatregions. He has demonstrated skill and ready humour inhis work as the Permanent Representative of Malaysia. Inote with some amazement his most recent achievement:getting this Assembly to begin each meeting promptly onschedule. This bodes well for our efforts here.Mr. Freitas do Amaral of Portugal presided over thefiftieth session of the General Assembly with the intellectand distinction characteristic of his career as aparliamentarian and teacher of law. We are in his debt.Last year  I saluted the Secretary-General  as well asthe women and men of the Secretariat  the specializedagencies and other bodies of the United Nations for theirextraordinary work during this difficult time in theOrganization’s history. The Solomon Islands applaudsthem all. It is difficult to persevere in the face of harshand unjustified criticism and insufficient financialresources while engaged in the complex task ofrevitalizing the United Nations to meet the needs of aworld in rapid transformation.This morning  on behalf of the Solomon Islands  Isigned the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty(CTBT). I was especially pleased to do so becausenuclear-weapons testing and disarmament are criticalissues for the people of my country. During the fiftiethsession of the General Assembly  the Solomon Islandsworked with its sister States of the South Pacific Forumand the Pacific basin for the adoption of resolution 50/70A on nuclear testing. Noting the international alarm overrecent nuclear tests and the potential negative effects ofunderground nuclear testing on health and theenvironment  the General Assembly deplored all nucleartesting and called for its immediate cessation.4The islands and atolls of the Pacific Ocean were thesites of nuclear tests for 50 years. Peoples were displacedand fragile environments destroyed. We welcome the endof the nuclear-weapons tests  but when will the States whoconducted them accept their responsibility for providinglong-term damage assessments and aid for resettlement andthe restoration of economic productivity?Solomon Islands also welcomes the signature ofTonga  as well as the signature and ratification by theRepublic of Vanuatu  of the South Pacific Nuclear FreeZone Treaty and the signing of its Protocols by France  theUnited Kingdom and the United States of America.Last November  the judges of the International Courtof Justice heard two weeks of argument to assist them inrendering the Advisory Opinion requested by the GeneralAssembly at its forty-ninth session on the question: Is thethreat or use of nuclear weapons in any circumstancespermitted under international law? The Solomon Islandsworked closely with the Marshall Islands and WesternSamoa in developing and presenting to the Court  incooperation with other States  the case that the use of eventhe smallest nuclear weapon would violate internationallaw  particularly humanitarian law. The landmark Opinionrendered by the Court on 8 July largely supported ourposition. Regrettably  the nuclear Powers that arguedagainst us at the International Court of Justice see itotherwise. We look forward to the debate on the AdvisoryOpinion  which is on the agenda thanks to the initiative ofMalaysia.The indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)  the creation ofNuclear-Weapon-Free Zones in Africa and South-East Asia the finding of the International Court of Justice  the GeneralAssembly’s adoption of the CTBT — whatever itsshortcomings — and the report of the CanberraCommission indicate that a momentum exists forestablishing targets and timetables for the elimination of allnuclear weapons. Although the majority of States supportthis  such States have no forum in which they can developtheir ideas and formulate a strategy. Solomon Islandsproposes the creation of a forum of non-nuclear-weaponStates. Committed to the elimination of nuclear weapons the forum would seek agreement on a unified approach tothe full implementation of article VI of the NPT andmonitor progress towards that end. Moreover  the forumwould work to give effect to arrangements such as thesouthern hemisphere nuclear-weapon-free zone and linkedregional nuclear-weapon-free zones that could evolve intoa global nuclear-weapon-free system.Solomon Islands endorses the statement made herelast week by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of theMarshall Islands on behalf of the South Pacific Forum.Solomon Islands  a member of the South Pacific Forumministerial committee on New Caledonia  welcomes theprogress facilitated by France and the relevant parties inimplementing the Matignon Accords.For the small island States of the Pacific  theenvironment  development and international trade arematters of critical concern. The development ofcomprehensive arrangements for the sustainablemanagement of our region’s fisheries is urgently needed.Solomon Islands will soon sign and ratify the Agreementfor the Implementation of the Provisions of theConvention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982relating to the Conservation and Management ofStraddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks.The special session of the General Assembly to beconvened in 1997 to review Agenda 21 is also of greatimportance to Solomon Islands. We seek practical waysto improve ongoing regional efforts to meet the Agenda’sgoals.The second assessment report of theIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is a call tothe international community to speed up negotiations recognizing that such a global problem demands acollective solution. Solomon Islands continues to supportthe Alliance of Small Island States Protocol to the UnitedNations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Iflower greenhouse gas emissions are not achieved soon the very survival of small island developing States will bethreatened. Moreover  the sustainable management andconservation of our forests are essential for the biologicaldiversity and economy of the country.In the Pacific  where healthy coral reefs are essentialfor effective coastal zone management  we arecollaborating in the international coral reef initiative andwill take part in our region’s Year of the Coral Reef in1997. As valuable as these efforts are  what remains to bedone is formidable. The recent report to the UnitedNations Commission on Sustainable Development onactivities to implement the Barbados Programme ofAction in the Pacific region shows the range andmagnitude of the problems the citizens of the small islanddeveloping States face.The future of the Solomon Islands must depend ona people-centred development strategy that uses a bottom-5up and top-down process of decision-making. With apopulation of fewer than 400 000 people of diverse ethnicand linguistic origins  80 per cent of whom live in ruralsettings on hundreds of islands arrayed over 1 600kilometres of ocean  no other system is workable. A majorchange in our system of provincial government is designedto maximize rural community participation in planning anddecision-making. Overseas development assistance could therefore  be directed to where it is most needed. We arefostering public health  literacy and electrification. That iswhy the recent completion of our first solar-powered villageis important for us. In implementing the Habitat Agenda we are encouraging self-reliance in village development.Solar and other renewable energy resources  such as waterand wind  will further our economic  education and healthdevelopment plans.Several weeks ago  the Internet reached the SolomonIslands. Personal computers in a growing number of oursecondary schools and the possibility of lap-top computersin the hands of teachers and students give new hope for mycountry’s future. We are now using the World Wide Webto introduce the country to potential investors and tourists.Peace in our region is essential for sustainabledevelopment. Solomon Islands encourages the efforts ofPapua New Guinea to resolve its Bougainville crisisthrough constructive dialogue with all the parties concerned.The confidence-building measures have reduced the tensionacross the border between Papua New Guinea and SolomonIslands.Solomon Islands  which patiently follows the debateson reforming the United Nations  recognizes the difficultiesinherent in making the Organization more effective. Wesupport an increase in the non-permanent membership ofthe Security Council on a regional basis and thank Italy forits valuable proposal. If the number of permanent membersis also to be enlarged  the responsibilities of permanentmembership and the criteria for the use of the veto must beestablished and made transparent.The fiftieth anniversary Declaration called for therevitalization of the work of the General Assembly  theuniversal organ of the States Members of the UnitedNations. Proposals have been put forward and debated.Calls for reducing the length of the agenda continue to echothrough these halls. Yet  in the past few weeks  we haveseen how vital the General Assembly can become when adelegation skilfully and vigorously presses forward with agreat issue and effectively marshals the support of manyMember States. I refer to the extraordinary work ofAmbassador Richard Butler and his Australian colleaguesin mobilizing overwhelming support for the adoption ofthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT).When the will and commitment are present  the GeneralAssembly can act with brilliant effectiveness  winning theapplause of a world hungry for security  peace andprosperity.Such an achievement need not be rare. As theuniversal organ of the Member States  the GeneralAssembly should be a force for democracy  transparencyand universality. For example  the Charter permits theGeneral Assembly a much larger role in the selection ofthe Secretary-General than it has exercised in the past.Confronted as we are with public action in this matter byone of the great Powers  should we not now seek to makethe process truly democratic and open? Can we afford toleave this essential issue to last-minute bargaining behindclosed doors? Twenty-five years ago  the GeneralAssembly at its twenty-sixth session adopted resolution2837 (XXVI)  which recognized the unquestionable valueof the general debate and said that it should continue tobe held every year and that the time devoted to it shouldbe utilized to the maximum.The general debate offers a glimpse of how MemberStates see the state of the world and the United Nations.Listening to the statements in this great Hall  one isstruck by the spectrum of ideas and opinions they present.Discussion would enhance their value for us  but we havenot established appropriate venues at which the viewsoffered here could be thoroughly explored. Can we affordto deny ourselves the benefit of engaging our colleaguesintellectually?To move the General Assembly towards universality Solomon Islands believes that substantially reducing thefloor rate in the scale of assessments  as has beenproposed  would not only enable several countries in ourregion to seek membership of the United Nations butwould help many developing countries to pay their annualassessments in full and on time.Two themes have clearly emerged in our generaldebate: Whatever its weaknesses  the United Nations isindispensable; but without sufficient resources and adecisive commitment to true multilateralism  theOrganization cannot fulfil its obligations to the peoples ofthe world. Solomon Islands and the other small islanddeveloping States need this Organization. Whether theissue is investment  law enforcement  trade embargoes fishing rights  hazardous waste dumping  natural disasters 6autonomy  independence or any combination of these  thepeople of the small islands turn to the United Nations forsupport.We and others spoke out on behalf of the Republic ofChina on Taiwan  which  barred from the United Nationsand seeking unification with the People’s Republic ofChina  is attempting to enlarge its contribution to thedeveloping world through this Organization. SolomonIslands hopes that unification negotiations based on theproposals each party has put forward can begin in the nearfuture.The United Nations is dealing with important issues:the Agenda for Development  the programmes of actionapproved at the world conferences  technical assistance  theSecretary-General’s preventive diplomacy  the evolvinginternational system for protecting human rights. In thisrespect Solomon Islands especially thanks the InternationalCommittee of the Red Cross for its efforts to rid the worldof anti-personnel landmines and for its work caring for thedisplaced and searching for missing persons  includingKuwaitis and Greek Cypriots who have still not been heardfrom  and many other people who have “disappeared”.These are life and death matters even for those of uswho live on distant islands. Through a commitment toequity  democracy and tolerance based on multilateralismand universality  an effective United Nations will serve usall for generations to come."
"149",6260,"SLE",51,1996,"﻿On behalf of my country and onmy own behalf  I extend to you  Sir  our warmestcongratulations on your unanimous election as President ofthe fifty-first session of the Assembly. Your election isindeed a deserving tribute to you personally and to yourgreat country  Malaysia  which  over the years  has beenunflagging in its commitment to the principles and ideals ofthis Organization — the attainment of international peaceand justice. I am confident that your rich diplomaticexperience  coupled with your fine human qualities  willenable you to guide the deliberations of this session of theAssembly to a successful conclusion. Permit me  Sir  toalso take this opportunity to extend my delegation’sgratitude to your predecessor for having so ably steered theAssembly’s fiftieth session up to this momentous occasion.I should like at this point to convey our appreciationand gratitude to the Secretary-General  Mr. BoutrosBoutros-Ghali  for the dedicated and able manner in whichhe has guided the work of the Organization. In this regard we reaffirm our support for the Organization of AfricanUnity’s (OAU) declaration on the Secretary-General’s re-election. Permit me  Mr. Secretary-General  to convey through you  to the entire staff of the United Nations ouradmiration for their loyalty and commitment to theOrganization.I bring also the greetings and good will of thepeople of Sierra Leone. They have requested me toconvey our sincere gratitude to the internationalcommunity for its support in restoring democracy to ourcountry in March this year. I stand here today as atestimony to the right of that people  who in March ofthis year elected their Government and chose theirdestiny. As their leader  I am determined to live up totheir high aspirations and expectations. Allow me on thisoccasion also to pay tribute to our gallant citizens  manyof whom lost their lives in the process of restoringdemocracy and constitutional rule to our country.Despite this great achievement  my country is stillhaunted and tormented by the spectre of ongoing civilconflict in our country. The rebel war inflicted severepain and suffering on my people  who had never beforeimagined that such a terrible thing could happen to us.Thousands of innocent civilians — men  women andchildren — lost their lives; others were traumatized  aswell as physically or psychologically crippled for life; stillothers continue to languish as refugees or displacedpersons in inhospitable camps.The Revolutionary United Front (RUF) has nopolitical agenda and no respect for the democraticprocess. It consistently ignored an invitation to participatein the recent internationally supervised elections in spiteof numerous appeals and offers of assistance by theUnited Nations and other intergovernmental organizations.Instead  it set out to disrupt those elections by unleashingviolence against the electorates  killing many andmaiming many more. Thanks to our determination torestore democracy in our country  this RUF attemptfailed  as did its effort to collude with the military juntaand share power in defiance of the democratic process.The RUF draws its support from abducted villagersand rural schoolchildren  including girls aged seven andolder  and maintains their “loyalty” with the use of drugsand terror.This notwithstanding  my Government entered intopeace negotiations in the spirit of reconciliation  and I ampleased to report that the talks have advancedconsiderably. In March 1996  just after my assumption ofoffice  a ceasefire was agreed upon. In spite of someincidents  it is still generally holding.On behalf of the people and Government of theRepublic of Sierra Leone  I should like to take thisopportunity to express my sincere thanks to the Secretary-4General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for the continuingsupport he has afforded us to in promoting the cause ofdemocratization and the restoration of peace in my countryand  in particular  for his assignment of a Special Envoy whose constructive and enduring role has helped to advancethe peace process. I should also like to express gratitude toPresident Henri Konan-Bédié and the Government andpeople of the Republic of Côte d’Ivoire for the selfless andpainstaking efforts they have deployed in hosting andmediating the talks between the Government of SierraLeone and the RUF.After protracted and painstaking negotiations thatinvolved extensive Government concessions  including ageneral amnesty for all RUF members; an undertaking tohelp set up a trust fund for the RUF to assist it intransforming itself into a political party; the offer of jobs tothe RUF leader and his followers  including their absorptioninto the army  the police and other government institutions the RUF leader finally indicated his readiness to sign apeace agreement drafted by the host Government  Côted’Ivoire.However  the RUF leader now seems to be unwillingto honour his commitment to sign the agreement manufacturing various excuses to justify his prevarication.We are concerned that continued intransigence andprevarication by the RUF could precipitate a full-scaleresumption of hostilities  given the increasing level ofdistrust between the two sides. It is therefore time for theinternational community to act to forestall this potentialcatastrophe by demanding that the RUF sign the peaceagreement without further delay. Failing this  the impositionof sanctions against it should be considered  including thedenial of access to the facilities and territories of thirdcountries  and the prospect of its arraignment before a warcrimes tribunal for the serious crimes being perpetratedagainst innocent civilians.While we persevere in our efforts to bring this conflictto a peaceful end  I owe it to our people to emphasize theneed for the continued support of the internationalcommunity to help us in the task of rehabilitation andreconstruction. We are encouraged by the outcome of therecent round-table conference on Sierra Leone held inGeneva under the auspices of the United NationsDevelopment Programme (UNDP). We take thisopportunity to express our sincere thanks to those countriesthat have pledged generously to assist in our post-conflictrehabilitation and reconstruction efforts. We  for our part are determined to rebuild our country with all the energyand resources we can muster from within our borders. Wehave already embarked on this process  and we aredetermined to see it through  no matter what sacrifice isnecessary.Two decades ago  the prevailing perception in thisbody was that the end of the cold war would dramaticallyreduce the incidence of regional conflicts and thusenhance international peace and security. Today  however those conflicts appear to have been replaced by civil warsand ethnic strife  which now pose the greatest challengeto the peacekeeping and peacemaking capacities of theUnited Nations.We have witnessed mass horrors in Rwanda andBurundi  and intense internal strife in Somalia  Liberiaand  to a lesser extent  in my own country. Bosnia andHerzegovina  Chechnya and the occupied Palestinianterritories all have continued to engage the attention ofthe international community. We call upon the leaders andactors in those conflicts to renounce violence and toembark on sincere and serious negotiations with a view tofinding peaceful solutions. Agreements reached should behonoured and respected. The innocent  who are all toooften the victims of such conflicts  cry out for peacefulresolution.As regards the question of the peaceful resolution ofconflicts  of particular concern to my country is thesituation in Liberia. Consensus has once again emergedfrom the political dialogue between the various factions giving rise to renewed hopes of a durable peace for thatdevastated country and its people. Full implementation ofthe conditions embodied in the new implementation planof the Abuja Agreement  concluded at the recentEconomic Community of West African States Committeeof Nine summit held in Abuja  Federal Republic ofNigeria  would provide real hope for Liberia. We remainconfident that this time around  those responsible for theLiberians’ pain and suffering will find the courage andpatriotism to spare their fellow citizens further violenceand bloodshed. Enough is enough. The defenceless peopleof Liberia  especially innocent children  men and women have a right to freedom from violence; they have a rightto life.The situation in the Great Lakes region of Africa isalso cause for serious concern. As we watch the cautiousreturn of Rwandan refugees  we hope and pray that thewounds inflicted by ethnic strife will heal on the platformof national reconciliation. The ongoing crisis in Burundialso poses a challenge to the international community. In5the light of my own country’s recent history  we cannotcondone the seizure of power by the military from aconstitutionally elected Government. We call on allconcerned not to relent in their search for a long-termsolution to the horrendous crisis. Looking at the broaderpicture of tackling such difficulties  we hope that otherswill support the efforts of the Organization of AfricanUnity to strengthen its Mechanism for the prevention andresolution of conflicts.Closely linked to the issue of peace is that of theprotection of human rights. We reaffirm our faith in justiceand in the dignity and worth of the human person. That iswhy Sierra Leone fully supports the work of theInternational Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.We commend the work of the Preparatory Committee forits current efforts aimed at preparing the text of a statutefor an international criminal court  which will have animportant role in the area of massive human rightsviolations  which  notwithstanding the sad lessons ofhistory  continue today in several parts of the world.While political  regional and ethnic conflicts  civilwars and the menace of armaments — both nuclear andconventional — are a major concern  Sierra Leone believesthat the greatest threat to international peace and securitytoday lies in poverty and in economic and socialdeprivation. The nature and complexity of the economicand social problems that beset Africa are all too familiar tous. The majority of African countries  including SierraLeone  continue to face a myriad of economic andstructural challenges. Africa has the largest number of leastdeveloped countries and the lowest average per capitaincome in the developing world. In fact  Africa’s overallliving standards and socio-economic conditions havedeteriorated considerably since the beginning of this decade.Most African countries have encountered numerousdifficulties over the years in their effort to mobilize anddeploy financial and human resources for economicdevelopment. The levels of investment have not beenencouraging; nor have the levels of agricultural and mineraloutputs  due in large part to drought  economicdisincentives  political manipulation and an unfavourableinternational environment. In many cases  aided and abettedby ruthless arms merchants  many of us continue to engagein senseless fratricidal conflicts and the wanton destructionof the development infrastructure.We are also obliged to note that budgetary constraintsfaced by various developed countries  clarification offoreign aid objectives  revised conditions governing thegranting of assistance  and the heightened competitionamong various regions for aid packages constitute aserious challenge for developing countries such as mine.The ubiquitous debt burden and the debt- servicing levelsin no way help the situation  as they continue to be amajor stumbling block on the path of African economicrecovery and sustainable growth. Overseas developmentassistance and resource flows have dwindled to a levelthat gives us cause for concern. The downward trend inexport commodity prices and the agricultural policies ofsome of the industrialized nations have had a negativeimpact on Africa’s trade in these commodities  the mainsource of income for socio-economic development. In thisconnection  the debt burden that continues to hang over ushas conspired to frustrate our efforts at economic recoveryand development.Sierra Leone strongly believes that the urgentimplementation of the United Nations New Agenda forthe Development of Africa in the 1990s  adopted by theAssembly on 18 December 1991  is the best hope yet forsetting Africa on the road to positive sustainableeconomic development. We appreciate the fact that thebasic tenets of the New Agenda are grounded on theprinciples of shared responsibility and global partnershipbetween Africa and the rest of the internationalcommunity.Virtually all Member States of the first and secondworlds represented in the Assembly have experienced  atone time or another  the same or similar problems in theirstruggle for national unity and economic prosperity; weread about them in the cold pages of history.Unfortunately for us Africans  our economic and otherproblems — teething problems  if I may say so — aretransmitted live  instantly  by satellite to television setsacross the globe.Looking at current economic  social and politicalconditions on our continent  including the atrocities metedout to our own kith and kin  one is inclined to lose hopein the ability of Africa to achieve sustainabledevelopment.But the thrust of my message today is simple: Iappeal to the international community not to abandonAfrica. Even though we may be on our knees in anguish I firmly believe that there is hope for Africa  that Africaand its people have the ability and capacity to overcomenatural and self-inflicted constraints and to achievepolitical stability as well as reasonable economicprosperity. We have recently witnessed many changes onthe continent that lend credence to Africa’s genuine6commitment to the New Agenda for Africa and to otherplans for economic and political stability. Hence  there isstill hope for Africa. My presence here is symbolic of thathope. In spite of a rebel war that still hangs over mycountry  and in spite of attempts to frustrate the will of thepeople to choose their destiny freely and in a democraticmanner  Sierra Leoneans opted for democracy. We aredetermined to achieve genuine peace as well as theobjectives we have set for ourselves  which arecommensurate with the enormous sacrifices our people havemade.I am confident  therefore  that the political dialogue toensure the advent of good governance  which has begun inearnest in most countries throughout the continent  willcontinue. Given the proper chance to grow  our new andemerging democracies will gradually bear fruit  and ourdistressed nations will once again be guided by loftydemocratic ideals in an environment of peace  security andstability. African democracy will eventually be the order ofthe day. For these gains to be fully realized  it is thereforeimperative that the international community continue toplay a catalytic role in Africa’s development.In virtually every policy statement  every address andevery current discussion about the United Nations there issome reference to reform in our Organization. We areencouraged by the work of various intergovernmentalbodies to develop constructive ideas for reform. However reform should not be seen only in terms of the so-calledbloated bureaucracy of the Secretariat  to be used as ascapegoat for not meeting our obligations towards theOrganization.In the view of the Government of Sierra Leone  weneed a systemic reform; a reform of the political decision-making process in the Organization; a reform of some ofthe archaic methods and practices in the institutions thatcompose the United Nations system. Let us begin bytransforming  indeed transferring  the principles andconcepts of democratic governance  empowerment  power-sharing  decentralization and pluralism that we espouse fornation States to the international community at large. In thisregard  Africa should be entitled to play its role in theSecurity Council  the primary decision-making organ of thisOrganization  particularly in relation to international peaceand stability.In pursuit of this objective  we would like to recalland support the position expressed by the Non-AlignedMovement  that is  if there is no agreement on othercategories of membership  expansion should take place  forthe time being  only in the non-permanent category. Ishould like to note in this regard that the proposal ofItaly  among others  deserves careful consideration  as itaims at increasing the participation of all Member Statesin the Council  in particular medium-sized and smallcountries  and it would improve its representative anddemocratic character.For our part  we affirm our faith in the UnitedNations  which  in spite of its defects  remains thegreatest hope for the maintenance of international peaceand security  and for the promotion of the economic andsocial advancement of all peoples in our interdependentworld.Who needs the United Nations? First  it is animportant institution. Furthermore  it is an effectiveinternational mechanism when used properly. Some of usrepresented in the Assembly may need it more thanothers  but we all do  in one way or another.Let us therefore rededicate ourselves to its principlesand objectives  and  in the words of the Charter  make itat least“a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations inthe attainment of these common ends”."
"150",6307,"SLV",51,1996,"﻿I should like to extend to the Presidentand to all the delegations of Member States the cordialgreetings of the people and Government of El Salvador.I should also like to congratulate the President on hiselection to preside over this session and to express thanksto Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral for the dedication withwhich he carried out his mandate. At this session  wemust adopt very important decisions designed tostrengthen the Organization. We are convinced that thePresident’s pragmatism and experience will help ourdebate to take a proper course  overcome obstacles andgive impetus to the reforms called for by Member States.In October 1995 we celebrated the goldenanniversary of the United Nations  an occasion thatafforded us an opportunity to assess the work of theOrganization  to recognize the importance of thisinstitution in deepening understanding among nations andto ensure that its purposes and principles remain fully ineffect. At that time  world leaders agreed to support theimplementation of the reform needed to ensure that theinternational community would indeed have an effectiveOrganization able to meet the requirements presented bya constantly changing world.In the light of that commitment  we believe that atthis session debate should avoid unnecessaryconfrontation and be focused on the formulation ofpractical recommendations to ensure that the joint effortsof Member States will be in accordance with theDeclaration adopted at the fiftieth anniversary. In sodoing  important decisions can be taken that will give theOrganization the capabilities and resources to meet thechallenges of the new millennium effectively.The dynamics of the international system in recentyears lead us to an even greater appreciation of thevarious initiatives that have been discussed with regard tothe common problems that affect us all. In solving them we must act together and share the successful experiencesof each individual State in order to improve the standardof living of all our peoples.We commend the successful convening of summits at which programmes of action on global problemsrelating to women  children  human rights  theenvironment  social development  population and humansettlements have been adopted. These conferences are aclear demonstration of the political will and the moralcommitment of the international community to redefinethe paradigms for sustainable development by means of19rekindled creativity focused on the individual as well as thefamily.The complexity and interdependency of our problemsoblige each and every Member State to redouble theirefforts to participate more actively in finding solutions.Such solutions must emerge from a new vision of thecurrent international situation  characterized by increasinglyglobalized economies and requiring greater efficiency andcompetitiveness in the productive sectors in ordersuccessfully to confront higher levels of competition.Despite the positive elements of this picture  we mustnot confound joint efforts with the principal responsibilitythat each and every government bears in solving theproblems affecting its own society.In the global political situation  we note withsatisfaction that progress has been made in participatorydemocracy throughout the world. This is one of the mostimportant phenomena at the end of this century  as itenables individuals to participate directly and creatively insolving their own problems.We are convinced that United Nations efforts toresolve and contain conflicts by means of peacekeepingoperations are beneficial to the achievement of worldharmony. In addition to having benefited from this process El Salvador has been an active party to it.Our country’s experience in effectively settling itsrecent armed conflict can help other countries dealing withsimilar situations. This makes it possible for us to share ourknowledge and experience with the internationalcommunity  to contribute to solving such conflicts bymeans of dialogue and common work  leading to theconsolidation of peace  democracy and respect for humanrights.We have said that there has been a sea change in theinternational system  but conflicts and problems remain. Atthis time  we wish to encourage their resolution in anatmosphere of cooperation  dialogue and negotiation bymeans of frank and objective discussion.In recent years  25 new States have exercised theirsovereign right to self-determination and become Membersof the United Nations  thereby reaffirming theOrganization’s principle of universality. Unfortunately thisprinciple has not been fully respected and will not be fullyrespected until all States  including the Republic of Chinain Taiwan  are represented in the United Nations.The creation of jobs  the rule of law  the security ofcitizens  access to proper housing  health  education medical care and nutrition for children  and a clean andlife-sustaining environment are all requirements thatdeserve priority. If at the United Nations we canformulate policies and carry out innovative  effectiveactivities in this connection  people throughout the world particularly the most dispossessed  can benefit from thisimportant step forward in solving their problems. This isthe only way the Organization can truly make a creativeand effective contribution to ensuring that democracy isperceived as a positive process for humankind.The financial problems of our Organization are anobstacle to the proper functioning of its programmes andactivities  especially those in less developed countries.The needs of development require that the United Nationsfunction more transparently  effectively and  above all efficiently. For this  our beliefs and our actions must beconsistent.The new vision that is emerging in the internationalsystem can be explained by the domestic transformationstaking place in many countries throughout the world.Central America is a part of this process. Allow me todescribe the current experiences of our region. A fewyears before the start of the new millennium  the CentralAmerican countries have left behind our sad history ofconfrontation and have embarked upon the path to peace freedom  democracy and development  as shaped by theCentral American Presidents in our Alliance for theSustainable Development of Central America. ThisAlliance comprises policies  programmes and activitiesthat provide a new system for integral development andare creating progressive change in living standards byensuring economic growth with social equity  anddevelopment that is in harmony with nature  thus ensuringthat future generations will have a high quality of life.The Central American Presidents also adopted aseries of commitments to work together to meet theobjectives of the Alliance for Sustainable Development.In political terms  these include strengthening andconsolidating the rule of law and democratic security aswell as modernizing the public sector; in economic terms improving economic integration  harmonizingmacroeconomic policies and modernizing regionalinfrastructures; in the social sphere  systematicallyreducing poverty  emphasizing job-creation andinvestment in human capital  giving priority to eduction health and training; in the cultural area  ensuring thepreservation of the values and traditions of the cultural20heritage of the Central American peoples; and inenvironmental terms  preserving and protecting the bio-diversity of the region  promoting reforestation and theappropriate utilization of water catchment areas  biologicalcorridors and protected areas.In El Salvador  barely four years after the signature ofthe peace accords  we are pleased to note that we havecome close to full implementation of the commitmentsentered into at the time and are moving strongly towardsestablishing democratic institutions and nationalreconstruction. Our peace process has been held up as anexample  and we are pleased to serve as a model and anencouragement to ensure that situations similar to ours canbe solved in other areas of the world. After having solveda prolonged domestic conflict by political means  weSalvadorans have many challenges before us which can besummed up in a few words: the achievement of a lasting stable and modern democracy based on the rule of law thatwill enable us to achieve social peace and the building ofa new El Salvador.For these reasons  we are determined to expediteactions aimed at satisfying the deepest aspirations of ourpeople: worthwhile and well-paid work; a participatoryeducation stressing the creation of a culture of peace basedon civic and moral values; a health system that is not onlycurative but preventive; the promotion of micro-enterprisesand small businesses; full respect for and promotion ofhuman rights  including special emphasis on the rights ofwomen and children; the restoration and preservation of ourenvironment; strengthening the rule of law; and theconsolidation of a true system of civil liberties. On thisbasis  the Salvadoran people will be able to put all of theirtalents and efforts into achieving the sustainable andintegral development of society.We believe that human and economic development aretwo sides of the same coin  and mutually dependent.Greater human development makes possible conditionsunder which economic development can increase  which inturn produces increased resources to stimulate humandevelopment.Accordingly  the Government of President ArmandoCalderón Sol is carrying out reforms that will allow for thecreation of a country replete with opportunities for allSalvadorans  thereby breaking the vicious circle of povertyin which those born poor are condemned to die poor.This objective can be achieved as long as we  as anation  have a single vision that goes beyond differentideological or political circumstances. The great taskfacing this generation in El Salvador is to recognize thatsociety is a whole and to ensure that all the force ofhistory is brought to bear in order to find solutions thatbenefit the entire population.The people and Government of El Salvador wish toreaffirm their recognition of the contribution made by theSecretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  hisrepresentatives and the agencies of the United Nationssystem  to the consolidation of peace  democracy andreconstruction in our country. We would like also tothank the international community for its material technical and financial support to complement the effortsof the Salvadoran people to achieve peace and sustainabledevelopment  which has enabled us to begin a process ofmodernization  so as to meet successfully the challengesof the twenty-first century.In conclusion  we would like to express our absoluteconfidence that  at the conclusion of the fifty-first sessionof the General Assembly  the peoples of the world whoare represented here will have reached a greater level ofunderstanding  trust and cooperation  enabling them todeal together with the problems affecting the internationalcommunity."
"151",6332,"SMR",51,1996,"﻿On behalf of theRepublic of San Marino and my delegation  I wish  firstof all  to congratulate you  Sir  on your unanimouselection as President of the General Assembly at its fifty-first session. This is a recognition of your competenceand gifts as a diplomat and thus a guarantee of successfor our activities.At the same time  let me also thank your predecessorfor the excellent way in which he guided the work of thefiftieth session  just concluded.We are all aware that the United Nations rests upona community of States. Similarly  we are all aware thatthe very existence and future of any State depends on theindividuals who not only comprise it but also determineits life and shape its history.The United Nations  therefore  must understand andmeet the needs of all human beings if it is to representthe entire family of Member States  protect their interestsand fulfil the legitimate expectations of the largestpossible number of individuals.Presently  humanity is confronted with the challengesof development versus underdevelopment  progress versusrecession  wealth versus extreme and ever-increasingpoverty. These phenomena affect less-favoured andsocially advanced countries alike  leading to socialdiscrepancies and situations in which some manage toplan their own development  while others  deprived of jobopportunities  fail.Development issues are inextricably intertwined withthe destiny of nations. They change the face of countriesand peoples and exacerbate the pressures on the less-favoured and most populous regions of the world. This isa real and constant threat to peace.In some cases  the situation is aggravated by thefragility or  even worse  lack of democratic institutions.Here  power is wielded as an end in itself and not as an6instrument for achieving the common ideal. Societies andStates tend to withdraw into themselves  their only concernbeing to retain their strength and power. Sometimes thosewho hold the power do not bother to meet the needs of arapidly changing society  except when forced to preservethe necessary consensus.Our Organization should spare no effort to helpcountries and peoples alike to redress the balance andremedy these errors.The items on the agenda for discussion at the fifty-first session of the General Assembly are of paramountimportance and deserve the utmost attention and impartialand thorough analysis  since they pertain  on the one hand to the peaceful coexistence of peoples and  on the other  tothe existence and the structure of the Organization itself.Ultimately  peace and coexistence depend on and are bestgoverned by this institution.All efforts must be pooled to improve  update andrender the United Nations more effective. This objectivecan be achieved through a reform of the system inspired byequality  justice and wider democracy and aimed atensuring broader participation and the fair sharing of dutiesand powers among all Member States.San Marino pledges itself to fulfilling the tasks derivedfrom its United Nations membership  while benefitting fromthe opportunity to participate actively and make itscontribution to the various bodies of the United Nations.Undoubtedly  the strengthening and enhancing of theUnited Nations require a review of the composition  role functioning and powers of the Security Council. Thisreview process  however  is proceeding very slowly and attimes reveals inadequate understanding  cooperation andacceptance of the views of others.We are convinced that the Security Council mustadjust to the changes brought about by historical eventsand  consequently  to the expanded membership of theUnited Nations itself  whose character and essence areclearly becoming increasingly universal. San Marinobelieves that the Security Council must increase itsmembership  since  as it stands today  it no longer reflectsthe world’s reality  nor does it promote a rotating system inwhich all States  irrespective of their size  are equallyrepresented and can participate and make their owncontributions.As regards the decision-making process of theSecurity Council  we believe that the maintenance exercise and potential extension of the right of veto mustbe carefully reconsidered. Fortunately  we are living in anera characterized by dialogue  debate  discussion proposals and the search for joint solutions. These are theinstruments which we should resort to  rather than theright of veto. Over 50 years of activity and progress allowand entitle us to reconsider other instruments that  havingproved useful in dealing with initial difficulties and tragicsituations  are no longer necessary for further growth andconsolidation.Lastly  special attention should be paid to thedevelopment and interpretation of the Security Council’srules of procedure  with a view to adopting a more openattitude and a larger involvement of States in discussingthe issues at stake. In this context  let me call on allMember States to intensify their efforts to find auniversally acceptable solution.Is this all mere utopia? If it is  then we must notforget that those who have committed themselves toserving their countries and the international communityhave a duty to translate this utopia rationally into apolitical design  without neglecting or ignoring otherpeople’s expectations. Only in this way will that utopiabecome a real political design based on the principles ofresponsibility  equality and justice.I wish to express the deepest satisfaction of theGovernment of the Republic of San Marino at theadoption of the resolution on the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty  which my country cosponsored. Today I have the honour of signing this Treaty on behalf of mycountry. We hope that all States will become loyal Partiesto the Treaty and cooperate in the elimination of nuclearenergy for non-peaceful uses  so that future generationsmay inherit an environmentally sound planet.Given its geographical location in Europe  SanMarino is particularly attentive to the evolution of thepeace process in the Mediterranean area  especially in theMiddle East  where the earlier general enthusiasm hasbeen overshadowed by disenchantment and frequentdifficulties. Fortunately  hope  however weak and volatile is still alive. The Middle East still needs the internationalcommunity’s commitment and encouragement to proceedto a peaceful settlement of long-standing and more recentdisputes that are the cause of division and uncertainty.7In the speech I delivered at the fiftieth session of theGeneral Assembly  I stressed  on behalf of the Governmentof San Marino  the need to reconsider the instrument of theembargo  its effectiveness and repercussions  especially inthose cases where  in the absence of armed conflict international isolation alone has proved a valid moral andpolitical means of international pressure. In this regard  itis with satisfaction that I note that the elimination ofcoercive economic measures as a means of politicalcompulsion has been placed on this session’s agenda. TheGovernment of the Republic of San Marino is confidentthat the debate will lead to a proper examination andresolution of the problem  so that innocent people who arealready suffering are no longer the main targets of thesemeasures.The Republic of San Marino firmly believes that theUnited Nations  like the Council of Europe and theOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe  mustremain the most appropriate forum for producing concreteresults and enhancing the mechanism of fruitful dialogueand the exchange of ideas. The most daunting challenge isstill that of preserving future generations from the scourgeof war by reaffirming human dignity and promoting freeand equitable social progress."
"152",6448,"SUR",51,1996,"﻿May I first join precedingspeakers and congratulate you most sincerely  Sir  on behalfof the Government and the people of the Republic ofSuriname on your unanimous election to the presidency ofthe fifty-first session of the General Assembly. On behalfof my delegation  I pledge you our full support as you carryout the weighty and challenging responsibilities of youroffice. I also wish to pay tribute to Mr. Diogo Freitas doAmaral for the excellent and exemplary manner in whichhe presided over the fiftieth session of the GeneralAssembly.The dynamic and extraordinary manner in whichMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali has accomplished his mission asSecretary-General in difficult circumstances of financialconstraints and wars within and among Nations  and hisfostering of social and economic development  has earnedour sincere gratitude. My Government believes that notableendeavours have been undertaken by His ExcellencyMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali to shape the future of the UnitedNations in accordance with the needs and aspirations oftoday’s world.As members may know  the people of the Republic ofSuriname  availing themselves of their fundamentaldemocratic right through fair  free and secret elections on23 May and 5 September 1996  have elected the newpolitical leadership of the country. As testimony to thisdemocratic process  I stand before the Assembly on behalfof my Government and people as the newly electedPresident of the Republic of Suriname.My Government believes that the main challengefacing us is the difficult task of reversing the currenttendency towards the social disintegration of the nation intoa process of nation- building and creating social harmony.The need for this is even more pressing  consideringthat Suriname has a small population  composed of differentethnic and indigenous groups and that the living conditionsof large segments of its population have deterioratedsignificantly. One of the fundamental problems in meetingthis challenge lies in the development of an economy thatis diversified and not dependent on just one economicsector — and even less  dependent on a single donorcountry.In order to ensure that our people have the actualenjoyment of human rights in the widest sense of theword  a social system will be created that will focusattention on guaranteeing every citizen minimal socialsecurity; creating a society in which the quality of life isequal for all and harmony is safeguarded; offeringSurinamese women greater opportunities to develop theirpotentialities and to participate in the social structures  aswell as enhancing  in the widest sense of the word  thecare for the Surinamese child; providing for the basicneeds of the people  such as food supply  health care education  housing  public transport  water supply employment  passable roads and affordable energy supply;and guaranteeing the protection of property by means ofadequate security.The Government of Suriname is aware that therealization of these tasks will demand great efforts fromthe Government itself and from the entire population. Inthis endeavour we shall work to bring about theadministrative and budgetary decentralization of theadministration through the strengthening of people-oriented democracy by giving participatory democracy thescope to develop.The decentralization of legislation and administrationwill be given further attention  to facilitate regional andlocal development  with the full participation of regionaland local structures. The necessary conditions will becreated for an integrated approach to the development ofthe districts and the interior  so as to eliminatedevelopment lag in these regions. We fully realize that theresponsibility for achieving this goal lies primarily withthe Government and the people of Suriname. Weacknowledge  however  that we live in a larger world  ina period in which having friendly relations is of eminentimportance. In accordance with international law  and onthe basis of the Charter of the United Nations and theprinciples of the Non-Aligned Movement  Suriname willestablish and maintain relations with friendly nations andinternational and regional organizations throughout theworld.Close relations with countries that are ourneighbours from a historical  cultural or geographicalpoint of view  especially France  Brazil and Guyana  and5with Venezuela  the Kingdom of the Netherlands and theUnited States of America  will be maintained and deepened.Furthermore  we will strengthen our efforts for fullintegration into the subregion  into the wider Caribbeanregion and into the Americas through our membership inthe Caribbean Community and the Association of CaribbeanStates and through our participation in the free-trade zoneto be established in the year 2005.This approach demands a more business-like stance inmultilateral and bilateral relations as concerns the principlesof equality  mutual respect  and the interest and protectionof our national sovereignty.One of the most important characteristics of our era isthe transitional phase we are going through  in which newideas  new Powers  new values and norms have arisen leaving their mark on both national and internationalpolitics  on the national and international economy  and onthe formation and content of international relations. TheUnited Nations  which plays a crucial role in defininginternational relations and creating favourable conditions forpeace  stability and development  reflects this transitionalprocess.In considering the need to redefine the role and tasksof the United Nations in the post-cold-war era  some peoplequestion whether the United Nations still has a role to playin the international arena. As far as Suriname is concerned the United Nations  as a centre of multilateral relations  hasdemonstrated its ability to play a unique role in theachievement of overall human development on a globalscale. The United Nations has also demonstrated anextraordinary capacity for giving primacy to the ideals andaspirations enshrined in its Charter  and has indeed provedto be effective in the pursuit of such essential tasks as themaintenance of peace and security and the promotion ofdevelopment.Along these lines  we would like to emphasize that thecontinuation of the United Nations as a centre formultilateral discussion and action is indispensable. Weacknowledge the need  however  to redefine its functions.First  there is a clear need to reform its bureaucraticstructures in order to make it more effective and efficientand to bring it more in line with the aspirations of themajority of the world’s population. Secondly  we mustabide by our obligations under the Charter of the UnitedNations to provide the necessary funds for its properfunctioning  even though a restructuring of the current scaleof assessed contributions could be considered.We believe that if the United Nations is consideredas a train of peace and development on these two tracks humankind will embrace our Organization  which willhelp us to move forward into the twenty-first century.On the eve of the new millennium  it is imperativefor the international community to seek solutions topressing problems  of which abject poverty may well bethe most compelling. The solemn commitments of theWorld Summit for Social Development and the launchingof 1996 as the International Year for the Eradication ofPoverty and the period 1997-2006 as the United NationsDecade for the Eradication of Poverty have our fullsupport. There is evidence the world over that continuingpoverty  if not addressed adequately  will result in socialdisharmony and in economic and political disorder  andwill become a threat to national and international peaceand stability  thereby negatively affecting the growth andconsolidation of democracy and human rights.Let it be understood that all efforts to combat thescourge of illicit drug trafficking  terrorism and organizedcrime will prove to be fruitless unless we present a unitedfront to eradicate poverty.Suriname has drawn unexpected internationalattention by its resolve to employ its timber resources forthe development of its people. My Government is awareof the concern of the international community as to thepossible consequences of an unsustainable use of ourforest. There are many examples throughout the world onhow we should not proceed  and we have learned fromthose experiences.In order to strike a proper balance between ouractual needs for development and the needs of futuregenerations  the Government of Suriname will abide bythe commitment expressed through its contribution at theRio Conference in 1992 and to the subsequentinvestigations and deliberations at various levels ofsociety in conjunction with foreign investors. In all theseendeavours we will continue to be cautious  with dueregard for the interests of potential investors  the interestsof our indigenous people and the need to protect theinterests of future generations.We hope that the international community will alsoabide by its obligation to provide the necessarytechnological and financial assistance  thus contributing to6the achievement of these goals. In this respect we lookforward to the coming review meeting on theimplementation of Agenda 21.The Government of the Republic of Suriname is veryconcerned about the problem of illicit drug trafficking because it poses special security problems for countriessuch as Suriname  which have insufficient resources toguard its hundreds of miles of shoreline and vast underpopulated land areas. Therefore  as part of our policyof maximum cooperation in the fight against drugs  wehave entered into cooperation agreements with manycountries in Latin America and the Caribbean  especiallywith those States adjacent to Suriname. In this context  Ishould like to mention the recently established and muchappreciated cooperation between Surinamese policeauthorities and the drug enforcement agencies of theGovernment of the United States of America. However finding an adequate solution to the drug problem willdepend in no small measure on whether equal attention isgiven to both the supply and the demand sides of thisphenomenon.While reflecting on the issues facing our world andamidst the many challenges to creating global solidarity  myGovernment wishes to express its serious concerns over thedevelopments in the Middle East  which have resulted in avirtual discontinuation of the historic peace process. Wehope that the parties concerned and the internationalcommunity will succeed in bringing the peace process backon track. The agony of bloodshed and the loss of lives mustbe avoided  and there are no alternatives to dialogue andpeace.I am deeply honoured to have had the opportunity toaddress this body on a number of issues that are of primeimportance to the Government and the people of theRepublic of Suriname. I would like to conclude byreiterating our commitment to contribute to the creation ofa new world order characterized by the eradication ofpoverty and based on a more just distribution of wealth andon an atmosphere that augurs well for peace and globalimprovement of the quality of life on this beautiful planet."
"153",6472,"SVK",51,1996,"﻿I would like to express mysincere congratulations  Sir  on your election to thepresidency  and my best wishes for success in the fifty-firstsession of the General Assembly.I wish also to thank your predecessor  Mr. DiogoFreitas do Amaral  for his leadership and his personalcontribution to the positive achievements of last year’ssession.Last year we commemorated the fiftieth anniversary ofthe United Nations. That was a good opportunity not onlyfor historical reflection and drawing lessons from the past but also for setting out new priorities and tasks for theyears to come. It is obvious that the United Nations  if it isto meet expectations  has to adapt itself to meet newchallenges. Slovakia supports all efforts that will contributeto the enhancement of democracy  transparency andefficiency in the work of the United Nations.The need for the reform of the United Nations is alsoconfirmed by its current difficult financial situation. Thisstate of affairs can be resolved only if all Member Statesmeet their financial obligations in a timely manner andpay their arrears  and if a new formula for determining amore adequate scale of assessments based on a country’scapacity to pay is adopted. In this context  Slovakiaappreciates the European Union proposal for the financialreform of the United Nations and welcomes an open andpragmatic discussion in this regard.Let me stress that Slovakia  which has paid itscontributions to the United Nations regular budget in fulland on time  is also ready to bear its fair share ofresponsibilities in financing United Nations peace-keepingoperations. Now  more than three years after ouradmission to United Nations membership  it is high timeSlovakia was fairly allocated to an appropriate group forthe financing of United Nations peace-keeping. Bearingin mind the available economic data and comparing themwith those of several other countries of the CentralEuropean region  we are fully convinced that Slovakiashould be allocated to Group C  and we see nocompelling reason for further postponing this decision. Ofcourse  such a decision would be without prejudice to acomprehensive review process of the method to beapplied for the apportionment of the expenses of UnitedNations peace-keeping operations. But the contributionsof any Member State for 1993-1997 should be assessedonly on the basis of the scheme applicable in that period.In the context of United Nations institutional reform great attention is focused on the Security Council.Slovakia supports Security Council reform and is of theopinion that the expansion of its membership shouldreflect the principle of equitable geographicalrepresentation. The membership of the Group of EasternEuropean States has recently more than doubled  and thisfact should be duly taken into account in the SecurityCouncil reform process. Countries able to bear globalresponsibility should be granted the status they deserve inthe Security Council. On the other hand  expansion of themembership should hamper neither the efficiency nor thedecision-making process of the Security Council  so theincrease should be a rather limited one.Several inspiring proposals have been submitted to theUnited Nations. Slovakia is of the opinion that we shouldlook for the positive elements contained in those proposalsand make maximum efforts aimed at reaching a generallyacceptable solution. Practice has shown that an increasedrole for small and medium-sized countries in the SecurityCouncil can contribute favourably to the effectiveimplementation of its decisions  thus improving theauthority and the democratic character of that body.Slovakia actively supports the United Nations effortsto maintain and strengthen international peace and security.After three years of difficult negotiations  the SlovakRepublic has finally become a full-fledged member of theConference on Disarmament  thus filling the vacancycaused by the dissolution of the former Czechoslovakia.Slovakia  as a country using nuclear power solely forpeaceful purposes  unequivocally supports all steps whichprevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons and createconditions for their eventual elimination. Therefore  wewelcomed last year’s decision of the fifth ReviewConference to extend indefinitely the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. This September we votedfor the adoption of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-BanTreaty. Last Monday I had the honour to sign it on behalfof the Slovak Republic. We hope that it will soon enter intoforce and become law in international relations  thusmaking the world safer.The world community is also paying close attention toanother important disarmament agreement — namely  theChemical Weapons Convention. Slovakia has alreadyratified this important instrument and supports a speedyresumption of the ratification process so that it can enterinto force.We consider the problem posed by anti-personnellandmines a serious one. We therefore welcome initiativesaimed at a ban on the use  stockpiling  production andtransfer of this kind of weapon. For our part  we havealready unilaterally declared a moratorium on the exportof these devices  which cause casualties mostly among theinnocent civilian population.Peace-keeping operations continue to be a major partof United Nations activities. Slovakia sees their furtherdevelopment through the enhancement of elements ofpreventive diplomacy  with a significant strengthening oftheir humanitarian dimension and a broader incorporationof civilian components at all stages. Practical evidence ofSlovakia’s efforts to implement the basic United Nationsgoals is our participation in the United NationsTransitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia  Baranjaand Western Sirmium (UNTAES) and the United NationsAngola Verification Mission (UNAVEM III).Slovakia  as a troop-contributing country understands the significance of appropriate protection forUnited Nations personnel. Therefore  we have alreadyratified the Convention on the Safety of United Nationsand Associated Personnel. The brave men and women inblue helmets deserve stronger protection. We call upon allother States which have not yet become parties to theConvention to ratify it as soon as possible.The European continent was the theatre of two worldwars in the past. Therefore  it is of utmost importance topay great attention to the issues of security and peace inthis part of the world. Underestimating the gravity of thesituation caused an immense human tragedy for millionsof innocent people in the territory of the formerYugoslavia. The Dayton Agreements  and above all theirsuccessful implementation  represent a turning pointtowards a peaceful settlement of this traumatic conflict not only for its direct participants but also in a globalcontext. The international community also plays anirreplaceable role in this process through United Nationsmechanisms. Slovakia is ready to get fully involved in thereconstruction of the destroyed economies of the countriesof the region. We welcome Security Council resolution1074 (1996)  adopted just two days ago.Maintaining peace and security in other parts of theworld is of no lesser importance. Preserving thecontinuity of the peace process in the Middle East is animportant part of that. We must not allow the peaceprocess to end and the results achieved so far to bedestroyed.We observe with concern the growth of instabilityand the spread of conflicts on the African continent.Slovakia supports all efforts by the United Nations  the2Organization of African Unity and other organizationsinvolved in the search for peaceful solutions for eliminatingcrises and violence.Slovakia supports the efforts of the Secretary-Generalto achieve a durable solution to the question of Cyprus thatwill guarantee respect for the sovereignty  independence territorial integrity and unity of the country  in compliancewith the relevant United Nations resolutions. My country isprepared to continue its mission of good offices byorganizing meetings of the political party leaders of bothCypriot communities.As far as humanitarian assistance is concerned  weemphasize the need for the efficient mutual cooperation ofall involved entities  together with a strengthening of thecoordinating role of the Department of HumanitarianAffairs. Early warning as one element of preventivediplomacy and the rapid reaction of the internationalcommunity in response to an emerging crisis situation arefactors which significantly affect overall results. The role ofthe Department of Humanitarian Affairs in thereconstruction of territories suffering from militaryconflicts  including in demining  is important.International conflicts and internal strife are not theonly threats to international security and the stability ofStates. Increasingly  acts of terrorism and organizedtransnational criminal activities undermine democraticsocieties and become their joint enemies. We stronglysupport international cooperation aimed at their suppressionand elimination. We will study with interest several timelyinitiatives put forward during this General Assemblysession  such as the initiatives of Poland  the UnitedKingdom and the United States. We are convinced thatgranting observer status to INTERPOL in the GeneralAssembly will have a positive impact on the activities ofboth organizations in this field and will enable closercooperation.Human rights will undoubtedly continue to be high onthe United Nations agenda. Full respect for human rights isa prerequisite for freedom  justice  stability and peace. Wecommend the efforts to increase the efficiency of theUnited Nations human rights programmes  the work of theHigh Commissioner for Human Rights and his policy goalof transforming the Centre for Human Rights into anoverall coordinator of human rights policy and action withinthe United Nations system.In less than four years of statehood  Slovakia hasestablished a system of democratic institutions. Allcommitments under the relevant human rights instrumentshave been incorporated into its legislation. Our countryrespects the rule of law and guarantees all citizens withinits jurisdiction respect for human rights and fundamentalfreedoms  including for the individual rights of personsbelonging to national or ethnic minorities.We have established an inter-ministerial coordinatingcommittee for women’s issues as an advisory body to theSlovak Government. It is designed to initiate and monitorthe implementation of the conclusions andrecommendations of the Fourth World Conference onWomen.Family issues are very closely interlinked with therights of women and the rights of the child. In today’sworld  the family requires better protection andpromotion. A strong family is a basis for a sound society.An international centre for family studies has beenestablished in the Slovak capital. We are interested insigning a memorandum of understanding between theGovernment of the Slovak Republic and the UnitedNations on the promotion of family issues through theBratislava International Centre for Family Studies and theUnited Nations.Sustainable economic and social development is asine qua non for full enjoyment of human rights and thedecent life of mankind on all parts of the globe. Wewelcome the new  integrated and comprehensive focus ofthe United Nations on these issues  as reflected in theseries of United Nations conferences and summits heldduring the term of office of the current Secretary-General.He deserves his share of credit for their success. Now andin the years to come  we have to concentrate on theimplementation and review of the recommendations conclusions and plans of actions adopted in Rio  Vienna Cairo  Copenhagen  Beijing and Istanbul. We consider theconvening of a special session of the General Assemblyin 1997 to review the implementation of Agenda 21 atimely course of action. As a new member of theCommission on Sustainable Development we will payspecial attention to these activities.The Economic and Social Council should play a keyrole in fostering international activities for sustainableeconomic and social development; its coordinating role isneeded. We support efforts to enhance the efficiency ofthe Economic and Social Council and to streamline itsprocedures. Its sessions should be more focused ontopical issues. The relationship with its functionalcommittees requires further reflection and improvements.3Unnecessary duplication in the work of the GeneralAssembly and the Economic and Social Council should beavoided. The consideration of economic issues in theSecond Committee and social ones in the Third Committeeseems nowadays an increasingly artificial separation. Asthese issues are interlinked  it would only benefit us to finda proper remedy for this artificial separation. This mayrequire a new redistribution of responsibilities among theMain Committees.A close interconnection between environmental issuesand economic development is reflected in the process ofeconomic transformation in Slovakia. Economicdevelopment in Slovakia has reached a new level  and thefoundations for the transition to a market economy are nowfirmly laid. This can be seen in the positive economicresults achieved in 1995  when Slovakia ranked secondamong the countries of Central and Eastern Europe  with areal annual gross domestic product growth of 7.4 per cent.The Slovak economy is closely linked with thedevelopment of regional and world economies. As afounding country of the World Trade Organization Slovakia is actively participating in the ongoing integrationprocess and the formation of a new trade system on theregional and multilateral levels. In this context  thecooperation of the Central European Free Trade Agreementcountries may be an example worth following in theintegration of countries into the multilateral trade systemand global economy. We see the Central European FreeTrade Agreement not only as a vehicle to promote tradebetween its partners  but also as a step on the road to fullintegration into the European Union in the future  which isone of our foreign-policy priorities  together withmembership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization(NATO) and in the Organization for Economic Cooperationand Development.We welcome the positive results of the ninth sessionof the United Nations Conference on Trade andDevelopment (UNCTAD)  which stressed the need for theimprovement of cooperation with the WTO and the BrettonWoods institutions. The reform of its intergovernmentalstructure  the focus on a smaller number of priorities witha view to integrating developing countries into theinternational trade system  should lead to a renewal of thestatus of UNCTAD in the global economy.The forthcoming Ministerial Meeting of the WTO inSingapore will be a good opportunity to further strengthenthe Organization’s regulatory role. Slovakia also placesparticular importance on cooperation with other UnitedNations agencies. We are interested in activelycontributing to the improvement of their functioning.I am convinced that the United Nations will proveits viability in the future  as it has so far  and confirm itsunique role in the community of nations. The SlovakRepublic is prepared to do its utmost for this goal."
"154",6497,"SVN",51,1996,"﻿Please allow me tocongratulate the President and his country  Malaysia  onhis election to the presidency of the fifty-first session ofthe General Assembly. We hold his many contributions tothe work of the United Nations in very high regard andwe are convinced that his wisdom will guide this sessionof the General Assembly to a successful completion.I also take advantage of this occasion to thankProfessor Diogo Freitas do Amaral of Portugal for hiswise and dignified leadership of the General Assembly atits jubilee fiftieth session.The first half-century of the United Nations haselapsed and the General Assembly is meeting at a time ofgreat opportunities. Seldom has the United Nationsenjoyed such a high level of freedom from friction in therelations among the major Powers of the world.Moreover  our time is also one of profound and promisingchange. Never before has the world been better equippedto seize the opportunities of economic and technologicaldevelopment for the benefit of all. The democratictransformation which has taken place in large parts of theworld has substantially improved the quality of life andadded important opportunities for a large part of theworld’s population.However  very serious problems persist. Poverty andsocial disintegration  environmental degradation and newforms of threat to international peace and security areserious dangers to our common future. The fact that ourworld is no longer threatened by cold war rivalries offerslittle consolation if we think of the dangers which casttheir shadows on our path towards the future. The uniqueopportunities of our time can be forfeited.Never before has the time been so precious and theneed for effective global action so clear. The UnitedNations must be able to adjust so as to become moreeffective and more successful in addressing the challengesat hand. The essence of the principal task before theUnited Nations today can be captured in two words:adjustment and modernization. The compelling need toadjust and modernize the Organization should be guidingits activities  in particular those aiming at its reform.However  the United Nations experience of thereform efforts of the past year has not been entirelysatisfactory. The progress of various working groups of11the General Assembly has been slow  a fact to be notedwith concern. The present session of the General Assemblyand its general debate should provide fresh incentives andenergize the process of reform  which should proceed in acoherent and balanced manner.The process of downsizing the Secretariat  while beingwelcome and necessary  should become part of a widerchange characterized by a clear definition of the prioritiesof the United Nations and by an adequate allocation of itshuman and material resources. Greater discipline must beachieved in the financing of the United Nations. Thisshould be accompanied by a new  more balanced scale ofassessments. Furthermore  innovative forms of financingshould be devised  in particular in such domains as theprotection of environment and sustainable development.Last but not least  there is  in several parts of the UnitedNations  a need for structural change. The necessaryexpansion and reform of the Security Council — whichincludes reasonable enlargement — is a case in point. It isobvious that the efforts at reform should go hand in handwith the implementation of the basic tasks of the UnitedNations.The preservation of international peace and security isthe principal objective of the United Nations. One of theareas of implementation of this objective that is constantlygaining importance is cooperation between the UnitedNations and regional organizations in the common effortsfor world peace. We see possibilities in different parts ofthe world for the creation of durable security arrangementsbased on regional organizations and their cooperation withthe United Nations.We shall continue to support the efforts forcoordination and cooperation between the United Nationsand regional organizations through such methods asincreased consultation  diplomatic support  mutualoperational support and joint operations  in accordance withChapter VIII of the Charter of the United Nations.In Europe  the role of such regional organizations asthe European Union  the North Atlantic Treaty Organizationand the Organization for Security and Cooperation inEurope is constantly growing. We welcome and support thegrowing complementarity and cooperation between theseorganizations and the United Nations.Disarmament continues to be among the mostimportant areas in which the role of the United Nations isfundamental. It can be said that  in recent years  the UnitedNations has solidified its leading and coordinating role inthis area. The agreement on the non-proliferation ofnuclear weapons achieved last year and the conclusion ofthe Chemical Weapons Convention are witness to that.Slovenia welcomes the adoption of theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT)  whichwe signed yesterday. Slovenia took an active approachfrom the very beginning to the CTBT negotiations. Wedeeply believe that only strict implementation of theTreaty can contribute to a safer world in the future.The interaction between the Conference onDisarmament and the relevant United Nations bodies hasintensified. We should strive to improve further thedisarmament machinery. In this context  we note withregret that the project of expansion of the membership ofthe Conference on Disarmament remains incomplete. Wecontinue to believe that all States willing and able tocontribute to international disarmament efforts should beenabled to participate in the Conference on Disarmamentas full members. Slovenia wishes to be and is capable ofbeing among the members of the Conference.Slovenia also supports activities of the internationalcommunity needed to limit and eventually eliminate theuse of inhumane and excessively injurious weapons —including anti-personnel landmines — and is ready to takean active part in these efforts.In Bosnia and Herzegovina  the process of return tonormality has started. Less than a year ago  Sloveniajoined all the members of the international community inexpressing appreciation to the United States of Americaand all others involved in the preparation of the DaytonAgreement.After many years of tragically futile exercises  themoment has come for a decisive step towards real peacein Bosnia and in the Balkans. The military action of theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization gave credibility to thewritten word and created conditions for a comprehensiveeffort to rebuild Bosnia and Herzegovina economically politically and socially. In Slovenia  we welcomed theholding of the presidential and parliamentarian electionswhich took place in Bosnia and Herzegovina 10 days agoas a positive step forward and as a substantialcontribution to peace and stability in Bosnia andHerzegovina. Within the framework of post-conflictmanagement of the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina there is a growing need to ensure economic reconstructionand provide adequate economic aid. Slovenia is activelyparticipating in the international efforts for the economic12reconstruction of Bosnia and Herzegovina and still hostsmany Bosnian refugees.Slovenia is a young country that obtained UnitedNations membership in May 1992. Over the past five yearsof independence  Slovenia achieved positive results in theprocess of political and economic transformation. Growingcooperation with its neighbours and in the region enabledSlovenia to reach a high degree of economic and politicalstability. We strongly believe that such a policy is to beobserved as a contribution to the sustainable stability of theregion.After a successful transformation  Slovenia is nowready to take its share of responsibility not only forregional arrangements  but also for international peace andstability. That is why Slovenia seeks to become a SecurityCouncil member for the 1998-1999 term: to participateactively in the Council’s central role in developing aneffective system of global security at a time when theSecurity Council faces significant challenges to internationalpeace and security. We firmly believe that Slovenia is ableto meet all expectations and to work with other memberStates so as to make a full contribution to fulfilling thedemanding tasks of the Security Council."
"155",6542,"SWE",51,1996,"﻿The world of today is facedwith a paradox. While our global interdependence isgrowing and threats to our societies require globallycoordinated efforts  countries look inwards to their ownregions. But regional cooperation should never be madea pretext for ignoring the outside world. It should openitself to the world. It should be a building block for trulyglobal solidarity.We need a vision of a global neighbourhood  aglobal ethic and a global citizenship based on equality 11tolerance and solidarity. The globalization of our societiesis irreversible. We need to cooperate to deal with itsconsequences.We have the instrument: the United Nations. At 50 the United Nations is the subject of criticism and lack ofconfidence. The experience of political setbacks in Somalia Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia is not quickly forgotten.As in Bosnia  alternatives to the United Nations are soughtto deal with pressing international issues.But the tasks of the United Nations have not beenmade easier by Member States’ refusing to give it adequateresources. Many Members  including some major Powers still do not pay their contributions to the United Nationsfully or on time. It is a shame that the Secretary-Generalhas to devote much of his time to pleading with MemberStates to fulfil their financial obligations.Of course  the United Nations has its shortcomings. Itsuffers from bureaucracy and resistance to change. Thereare inefficiencies  but there are also success stories. Wemust not forget how United Nations operations helped buildpeaceful societies in Cambodia  El Salvador andMozambique  nor how United Nations humanitarian actionshave saved lives and alleviated suffering in Somalia Rwanda  Burundi  the former Yugoslavia and other crisisareas.For security in a broad sense  we need a globalOrganization. We need the United Nations as a meetingplace. We need the United Nations as a guardian ofinternational norms and principles. We need the UnitedNations to prevent conflicts and to find peaceful solutionswhen violence erupts. We need the United Nations to copewith global threats to human security. We need the UnitedNations as a safeguard against environmental threats and infavour of sustainable development. We need the UnitedNations to promote democracy and human rights. We needthe United Nations as a focal point for global solidarity.To realize this vision  we need a strong UnitedNations. Present inefficiencies have to be dealt withvigorously. Reform does not automatically equal down-sizing. In some fields  we may even have to expand theOrganization. But resources should not be wasted.Confidence in the Organization demands financialdiscipline. A revitalized United Nations means a morefocused and more determined United Nations.We need a United Nations that does not abandon itsposition as the principal instrument for maintaininginternational peace and security  a United Nations whichis capable of acting rapidly with adequate means andresources. Today  I join with 15 other Heads of State andGovernment in a statement in support of renewingmultilateralism. Without political leadership  the necessarychanges cannot be made.My Government  the Swedish Government  sees thefollowing steps as immediately required. First  UnitedNations Members must make a commitment to globalmultilateral cooperation. Secondly  payment must be madeof assessed contributions to the United Nations in full unconditionally and on time. Thirdly  there must be acommitment to strengthen and renew the United Nations including a time-frame for comprehensive reform.Fourthly  a commitment to the United Nations as aninstrument for sustainable economic and socialdevelopment is necessary. Fifthly  we must adopt anintegrated approach to security in view of long-termthreats to our societies. Sixthly  there must be acommitment to early action to prevent conflict and man-made disasters. Finally  there is need for an agreement todevelop the capacity of regional organizations to act incooperation with the United Nations.The Swedish Government is committed to a strongand effective United Nations and we are ready tocontribute to this objective. Therefore  Sweden seeks aseat on the Security Council for the 1997-1998 period.Our candidature has been launched with the full supportof the other Nordic countries: Denmark  Finland  Icelandand Norway.Members of the Security Council have a particularresponsibility for international peace and security. It isessential that small and medium-size countries serve onthe Council as well. The principle of rotation of non-permanent seats is important to us  for we have notserved on the Council for the past 20 years.If elected to the Council  Sweden would continue topursue openness and transparency. The links between theCouncil and the United Nations membership at large mustbe strengthened.Sweden would take independent positions  upholdingthe principles of international law. The primacy ofinternational and humanitarian law is a pillar of ourforeign policy. Sweden would contribute to a moreefficient United Nations role in the new generation ofpeace-keeping  including better coordination between thecivilian and military aspects of such operations. We12would also work for clearer mandates for United Nationsoperations.The capacity of the United Nations to command andcontrol large-scale peace-keeping and humanitarianoperations should be secured. We need an Organizationcapable of coordinating the various aspects of peaceoperations  including political peacemaking  military peace-keeping  long-term peace-building and humanitarian efforts.In our national planning for participation in futurepeace operations  my Government is taking steps tointegrate the training of military and civilian personnel inorder to facilitate coordination in the field. We invite othercountries to such training in Sweden.Sweden believes that the sanctions instrument has tobe refined. It is an important instrument for helping topreclude the use of armed force. But ways must be foundto avoid the suffering of innocent civilians and to alleviatethe consequences of sanctions for third parties. This isessential for the credibility and efficiency of the sanctionsinstrument.The United Nations represents the moral authority ofthe world community. It has a vital role in seeing to it thatwar crimes do not go unpunished. The Tribunals for theformer Yugoslavia and Rwanda should be given thenecessary support. The message must be clear. Civiliansmust be protected in all armed conflicts  whether internal orinternational. It should never be possible to live outcriminal perversions  to murder  torture or rape withimpunity. A permanent international criminal court shouldbe established in the year to come.The financial crisis and the non-payment of assessedcontributions to the United Nations must not be used as aninstrument to precipitate reforms  nor should they be anexcuse not to start urgent reforms. The possibility of usingalternative sources of financing needs to be exploredfurther. They could be used on a voluntary basis and serveto finance special needs outside the regular United Nationsbudget.The financing of global development cooperation is acritical issue that goes beyond the present financial crisis ofthe United Nations. The willingness to pay is decreasing.Development assistance is at its lowest level in decades.Only four countries — Sweden among them — fulfil theUnited Nations 0.7 per cent aid target. In our own case  wemaintain this commitment despite a very difficult financialsituation.Negotiated replenishment of multilateraldevelopment funds is not being honoured. The financingof global cooperation is a long-term issue that requires along-term solution.The globalization of our economies  our politics andour daily lives calls for cooperation. This has been clearlyillustrated in the report of the Commission on GlobalGovernance. Industrialized and developing countries willrealize that we have common interests  not least inmeeting the threats to our common future  theenvironment. Further efforts must also be made to resolvethe debt crisis for the poorest and most heavily indebtedcountries.We have a joint interest in open borders and freetrade  which create growth and wealth. A difficultobstacle to such a development is the worldwide increasein organized crime. In my own region around the BalticSea  the Heads of Government have decided to elaboratea common plan of action to combat cross-border crime.I believe that this session of the General Assemblyshould send a strong political signal that intensified globalefforts are also needed in this area. What is needed isincreased exchange of information  judicial cooperationand closer cooperation in training  inter alia  throughInterpol.Another global threat is the proliferation of arms both conventional arms and those designed for massdestruction. For decades  Sweden has been in theforefront in the struggle against nuclear arms. The entryinto force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treatyis essential. It would be a historic step towards theelimination of nuclear arms. I welcome the report of theCanberra Commission. It is a timely and valuablecontribution to this endeavour.Anti-personnel landmines are a threat todevelopment  to reconstruction and to human dignity inmany parts of the world. Mines do not discriminatebetween an invading soldier and a child at play. Theytotally ignore cease-fires and political settlements.It is imperative that we move towards a global banon these killers. Stockpiles should be destroyed. Sweden for its part  will take such a unilateral step. All countriesmust adhere to the stricter legal regime that has beenagreed for landmines  and much larger resources shouldbe directed to humanitarian mine clearance. My13Government is prepared to make its substantial contributionto this end.Multilateral cooperation is indispensable for dealingwith the crucial issues of survival facing us on thethreshold of the next millennium. We have a commonresponsibility to give to the next generation the tools forsuch cooperation. True security is global.Sweden contributes actively to cooperation andsecurity in our Baltic neighbourhood and in Europe. Ourfirm support for peace and development in the Middle East in southern Africa  in Asia and in Central America is wellknown. True to our traditions and our vision  we continueto stand up for cooperation and security in our globalneighbourhood."
"156",6580,"SWZ",51,1996,"﻿I bring with me from theKingdom of Swaziland the greetings and good wishes ofHis Majesty King Mswati III  Her Majesty the Indlovukaziand Queen Mother  the Government and the whole Swazination to our friends and fellow Members here at theUnited Nations.On behalf of the Kingdom of Swaziland  may Icongratulate you most sincerely  Sir  on your election to thepresidency of this fifty-first session of the GeneralAssembly. We are confident that the wisdom  experienceand diplomatic skills you bring to this office will ensuresuccess in the important business before us.Swaziland would also like to congratulate yourpredecessor  Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral  who presidedwith such skill over the historic fiftieth session.I should also like to record the deep gratitude of theSwazi nation to our Secretary-General  Mr. BoutrosBoutros-Ghali  and to the staff of the Secretariat for theiruntiring efforts in meeting the many challenges that faceour Organization as we prepare to enter a new millennium.One year ago  His Majesty King Mswati III joinedother leaders from around the world to celebrate the first 50years of achievement of the United Nations  to set out avision for the future and to reaffirm the commitment of theKingdom of Swaziland to the principles set out in ourOrganization’s founding Charter.Swaziland recognizes the vital role the Organizationhas played throughout its history  and we remain convincedthat the United Nations represents humankind’s best hopeof providing global leadership and guidance towardsachieving the conditions of universal peace and security thatwill allow equitable and sustainable development for all ourpeoples.Last year’s occasion was seen by many as anopportunity to review the internal mechanisms of ourOrganization and to call for greater efficiency accountability and representation in all areas of its work.Swaziland is therefore encouraged by the progressbeing made by the various working groups established bythe General Assembly  in particular progress towards thereform of the Secretariat and Security Council. We willcontinue to support all initiatives that bring about a moreefficient and cost-effective Organization.As the Organization’s membership has increasedover the years  so has the scope of its operations andresponsibilities. It is an unfortunate fact that our will toface these new challenges has not been met by acorresponding desire to pay for the means to overcomethem. We are faced with a stark choice between whetherto accept new responsibilities and the bill they attract  oradmit that we lack the financial commitment to meetthem.The Kingdom of Swaziland has always believed inthe principle of meeting our financial responsibilities infull and on time. We fully endorse the Secretary-General’s call to our fellow Members to do likewise  sothat the United Nations can have the resources at itsdisposal to perform the tasks that we expect of it.The Kingdom of Swaziland has been mostencouraged by recent developments towards the eventualelimination of weapons of mass destruction. Thenegotiations leading up to and the signing of theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty by anoverwhelming majority brings great credit to ourOrganization and to those whose hard work made itpossible.While we recognize and are deeply grateful for thehumanitarian assistance provided to Africa by the UnitedNations  we believe that the Organization needs to domore to strike at the causes of the hardship suffered by somany Africans who find themselves caught up in thehorror of war.One important issue concerns the flow of weaponsinto Africa from many other parts of the world. It is asimple fact in today’s world that arms  ammunition andarmaments are too easily accessible to those with themeans to procure them. The duration of conflict situationscan be limited by the non-availability of the weapons ofwar.It has been suggested that the first action of a trulycaring world in response to a conflict situation should beto cut off the supply of arms to all involved  and that thefinal responsibility of a caring world towards a countrythat has endured conflict is the clearance of the lastlandmine.This is a lesson we learned very late in recentdisasters such as the Bosnian crisis and in Rwanda. Wehave clearly not learned from it in other situations aroundthe world. Let us hope that the global community8represented here can move faster in future to imposelimitations on man’s ability to harm his fellow man.We in Africa recognize the need to be prepared forimmediate reaction to our continent’s problems and aretaking the necessary steps to abide by the principle of“African solutions to Africa’s problems”.The example of Burundi shows our continent’s desireto heed the warning signs and to ward off potentialdisasters before they happen.The Kingdom of Swaziland commends theOrganization of African Unity (OAU) and those individualcountries whose diplomacy and actions have prevented thesituation from spiralling out of control. The Organization ofAfrican Unity has also been at the forefront in attemptingto resolve crisis situations in Rwanda  Somalia  Sudan andLiberia.We join the rest of the world in applauding theseefforts  and we continue to offer our encouragement andsupport in bringing about an end to the suffering of thoseinvolved. The OAU represents the hope of all Africans forunity  peace and development  and deserves to be supportedstrongly by the rest of the world.On a subregional basis  and in the field of economicand trade cooperation  the Kingdom of Swaziland is amember of the Southern African Development Community(SADC) and the Common Market for Eastern and SouthernAfrica.SADC has recently expanded its mandate to include anew Organ on Politics  Defence and Security. This is anattempt to provide a mechanism by which member Statescan call for advice and support from other members in theevent of national and international issues that might threatenthe stability of the whole subregion.The new organ is founded on the principle of therecognition of the sovereignty of independent States and isintended precisely to identify potential problems  inwhatever context  and to look for solutions to persistentconcerns in our area. The organ provides an example of oursubregion’s commitment to peace and stability within andamong our member States as essential conditions for thedevelopment of our separate nations. It deserves the supportand encouragement of the rest of the world.The Kingdom of Swaziland has been heartened bythe various initiatives of the United Nations towards animprovement in global socio-economic conditions.The establishment of an international criminal courtis welcomed by Swaziland as a necessary extension ofjustice in cases where national jurisdiction does not apply.This step relies for its success on the political will of allStates and requires the widest possible representation ofMembers in its operation. Similarly  the Kingdom ofSwaziland welcomes the move by the United Nations toaddress the increasing threat posed to civil society byorganized crime and money-laundering.Of particular danger to Swaziland in this regard isthe increase in traffic across our borders and abuse amongour people of illegal drugs and related substances. This isa relatively new and alarming phenomenon for ourKingdom and undermines our efforts to promote nationaldevelopment. We therefore welcome the report of theSecretary-General on promoting international cooperationin the fight against the illegal drug trade  and we areappreciative of the high priority this subject attracts in therelevant agencies of the Organization.This effort has been matched by a similar initiativewithin our own SADC organization to encourage cross-border cooperation among our security personnel and toagree on measures among the Member States to containthis potentially devastating problem.It has been acknowledged that the continent ofAfrica presents particular challenges in the quest forsustainable development and a decent standard of livingfor all its peoples.With this in mind  the Kingdom of Swaziland gavean enthusiastic welcome to the Secretary-General’sinitiative on the United Nations New Agenda for theDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s. It was hoped thatthe Agenda would provide fresh impetus for change andfor the good of the people of Africa  but for manyreasons this remains an elusive dream. While social andeconomic conditions in many areas of the continentcontinue to decline  we are comforted by the fact thatefforts are being made to identify the reasons why somany commitments continue to remain on paper and whysome are implemented  but slowly.Swaziland echoes the call from all African brothersand sisters for real commitment to the New Agenda forthe Development of Africa so that future generations of9Africans will not be locked into the same spiral of despairthat many people on our continent find themselves in.It is to avoid being caught in this very situation thatthe Kingdom of Swaziland has always worked hard toensure that our people are at the centre of all our nationaldevelopment efforts. To this end the Kingdom frequentlyconsults with all its people on all the most importantdevelopment issues. Each and every Swazi has a voice andis given the opportunity to express his or her views on thematters that affect them.In recent times we have consulted in this way with thenation on our political direction and our economicpriorities. Currently we are addressing ourselves to a reviewof our Constitution.A constitutional review committee has beenestablished  representing the widest range of views  whichwill now consult with the nation and gather the people’swishes on the way they would like to see their countrymanaged. All will be free to contribute  and we will abideby the views of the majority. The end result will be theKingdom’s defining document  and it will  in a very realsense  be the people’s Constitution. This currentconsultation exercise is the latest example of our nation’sadherence to the principle of rule through consensus  and itis one that has served us well throughout our history.In a world where the definition of such concepts ashuman rights and democracy can vary so greatly and is sodependent on timing and circumstances  the Kingdom ofSwaziland has had a consistent vision of what is reallyrequired of its rulers by its people: to provide the freedomand opportunity for all Swazis to offer an opinion on thegreat matters of the day and for our leaders to be bound bythe wishes of the majority. We owe our survival as a nationto this principle  and we will continue to abide by it for aslong as it suits us.For the past three years the Kingdom of Swaziland hasgiven its support to efforts by the Republic of China onTaiwan to have its case presented to the General Assembly.As the world concentrates its attention on the great socialchallenges facing us all today  we must surely acknowledgethe need to engage all peoples of the world in a truly globaleffort to overcome them. Indeed  the Charter speaks of therequirement for universality in our Organization so that allmay feel represented here.The 23 million people of the Republic of China onTaiwan believe they can contribute significantly to thiseffort and have already shown that they are willing to doso in many areas of expertise  including povertyalleviation  private enterprise development andhumanitarian assistance. Many countries haveacknowledged this will on the part of the Government andthe people of the Republic of China on Taiwan  and therecent political developments in Taiwan have encouragedmany others to support our call.We are positive that a lasting solution can be foundto resolve this question. Hence  we support the idea of theGeneral Assembly establishing an ad hoc committee toaddress the question of the readmittance of the Republicof China on Taiwan into the United Nations.The Kingdom of Swaziland continues to place itsconfidence in the United Nations and in the principles onwhich it was founded. We remain deeply grateful for theassistance we have received over the years from itsagencies  and we look forward to many more years ofcooperation and support.For 51 years  and despite the many obstacles in itspath  the United Nations has presented to successivegenerations the only chance for a united  global approachto the world’s problems. We are reassured by theinitiatives for reform in the Organization and lookforward to a new dynamism and efficiency in itsoperations.I am charged by His Majesty King Mswati III  byHer Majesty the Indlovukazi  the Queen Mother  and bythe Government and the people of the Kingdom ofSwaziland  with proclaiming the renewal of ourcommitment to the founding Charter of the Organization.We ask for Almighty God’s blessing on its leaders andthose who work here  to give them the wisdom anddirection they need to carry out their vital tasks on behalfof all humankind."
"157",6613,"SYC",51,1996,"﻿The course of history appears to unwind rapidlyand with it  events occur  pass or recede into time imbuing the lives of our societies with the dual sensationof dizzying progress and desperately slow evolution. It isessential for people to live in harmony and to face  witha feeling of unity  goodwill and sharing  the greatchallenges which they could not overcome alone. That iswhy we are gathered here. We believe that  without eachother  we are weak and vulnerable and that  in order tolive better  it is essential that we be able to share andwork together.Upon reflection  however  it becomes more and moreclear that some of the countries that are developing morerapidly  thanks to the advantages of technological andscientific progress  are losing interest in those stillstruggling to survive and still facing economic difficulties food shortages and problems of health and education. Toall this can be added other  equally serious evils: theeffects of drugs  alcoholism  criminal behaviour andprostitution in all its forms.In our international forums we often speak ofsecurity  of action to combat international terrorism andof the war on organized crime. Just recently  we weretalking about working together against paedophilia. Theseare such horrible  painful things  but unfortunately socharacteristic of our times.So how can we not strongly condemn these attackson human security and dignity? But it is even moreimportant that our rejection of these crimes affecting theworld be felt with the same degree of intensity  regardlessof the country where they are committed — especially18when some countries lack the means to combat the crimes.Should not the spirit of solidarity imply a concern for thewell-being and security of all the inhabitants of the world?Should not each and every nation shed its selfish hypocritical attitudes?By not seeing further than our own interests  we treatothers as our lowly tools. And yet we are well aware thatfeelings of frustration and injustice are the source of somuch violence which so frequently plunges the world intomourning and makes people fear for their security.Therefore  if we want to world to develop harmoniously we must break the bonds of this indolent selfishness inwhich people see everything around them through the prismof self-satisfaction.If the existence of the United Nations is nowthreatened and if serious problems are undermining it andweakening the international community  it is preciselybecause the strongest partners will not agree to adopt therules that govern any family  in which everyone’s opinionsare heard and discussed and the strong support and help theweak.Instead  what do we observe? The most-favourednations seem to carry little about and refuse resolutely toaddress the realities handicapping the developing countries.Calculations  assessments  criteria are separated intocategories  mechanically  as if nations and peoples can bereduced to mere statistics. It must be said that the generousefforts of some rich countries  while helping developingcountries  also benefit  one way or another  directly andindirectly  the stingiest countries.Are we still seeking justice  equality and sustainabledevelopment throughout the world? In any case  the imagethe world projects of itself does not reflect these ideals  butrather two poles spinning further and further apart: the poleof wealth and the pole of poverty. It’s not that there hasbeen a lack of international meetings  at the highest levels to try to find more effective solutions to reduce the level ofpoverty  increase the equity of trade and so forth. But itseems that  with each meeting  these problems get worse.The firm ground of progress is crumbling under thefeet of the developing countries and their future — giventheir current relations with the Powers holding the reins ofthe global economy — seems quite uncertain. This isespecially true for the small island developing States likethe Seychelles  whose only resources are the precariousrevenues of tourism  which is subject to so manyvicissitudes  and fishing. Their meagre resources  pumpedinto a network of tremendous competition  require themto make titanic efforts. Like many other countries whoseterritories were long exploited by a great Power and thensuffered the repercussions of being suddenly abandonedwithout compensation  the Seychelles’ economy is evenmore vulnerable than it was before being buffeted by thisphenomenon.As they do every year  many speakers haveunderscored the importance of preserving the environmentin the context of sustainable development. The Presidentof the United States himself underscored this fact:(spoke in English)“Our planet is safer because of our common effortsto close Chernobyl  to address the challenges ofclimate change  to protect the world’s forests andoceans. Now we must uphold our duty as custodiansof our environment so that our children will inheritan even healthier planet.” (Official Records of theGeneral Assembly  Fifty-first Session  PlenaryMeetings  6th meeting  p. 14)(spoke in French)And  at the annual meeting of the Bretton Woodsinstitutions  United States Vice-President Albert Gore Jr.also made this point.(spoke in English)“But it also means giving greater attention tobroad issues that I firmly believe must shape andinform everything we do in our quest for equitableand sustainable global prosperity. The first of theseis a commitment to sustainable development and ourenvironment. We now know with perfect clarity thateconomic development and growth cannot ignoreecological realities. We know that investments thatgenuinely reduce poverty in an equitable andenduring way are investments that take theirenvironmental implications fully into account. Notonly is such an approach consistent with ourdevelopment objectives  but it will also be muchmore cost effective. Win-win situations are notalways available  but this is one of them and it isavailable.”(spoke in French)19And yet  many of our countries  although their survivaldepends on the entire world preserving the environment find themselves left by the wayside when certain greatPowers — having no further need of the hospitality of theirshores for their military or other installations — light-heartedly depart  leaving behind them a trail of debris andother things and leaving it up to the countries themselves todo the rest. As for the damages and costs — let’s not talkabout them.As for the reforms of the institutions of the UnitedNations system  the Seychelles is in favour of all proposalsaimed at improving the representation of the smaller Statesin our work. We believe that the international communitymust hear our voices  understand us and deal with thespecifics of our situation. Furthermore  to be moreobjective  the assessment criteria now being massivelyapplied to all the developing countries  which require morefocused attention  should be re-examined in the light of thevulnerability index. The index is too easily ignored  but isnonetheless very important in the establishment of theobjective data defining the profile of any given country.The fashion for what is commonly called “democracy”is sweeping the surface of the earth  and one of theprincipal criteria which the developed countries —democracy’s self-appointed guarantors — use for decidingeligibility for development assistance is the establishmentof a democratic system. Shouldn’t that respectableinstitution  democracy  be manifest within the Organizationitself when it elects a competent and honest leader in whomto duly vest its authority? In seeking to impose its logic byone way or another  in seeking to make its choice themajority’s choice  we are far from honouring the principleon which democracy is founded: majority rule. In otherwords  for a matter such as the renewal of the mandate ofthe United Nations Secretary-General  we should bettergauge the pros and cons  leaving aside those which mayseem a little too individualistic. We must be able to accept particularly if qualifications justify it  the choice of themajority of the Members of this eminently democraticinstitution: the United Nations.To conclude  I express my best wishes for greaterconcord in the future of the United Nations  whichrepresents the voice and the will of the peoples of theworld  so that the endeavour to which so much effort andgenerosity has been devoted may produce decisions andactions that will create for all the children  women and menof the Earth a way of life in which relations become morehumane and thus more conducive to the advent of aharmonious global society."
"158",6655,"SYR",51,1996,"﻿It is my pleasure tocongratulate Mr. Razali Ismail on his election to thepresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-firstsession  and to congratulate his friendly country Malaysia  on his election to that high international post.We are confident that his political experience anddiplomatic skill will lead to the success of this session’sdeliberations. May I also extend our thanks to hispredecessor for conducting the work of the fiftieth sessionof the General Assembly.On this occasion  we should like to express ourappreciation to the Secretary-General for his efforts toenhance the role of the United Nations  and our concernthat his international standing  and his mandate under theCharter be respected. We also believe that the commoninterest of Member States requires the support of hiscandidature for a second term.We live in a region which  because of the injustice occupation and aggression it has witnessed for decades has had more than its share of victims of wars andviolence. It was impossible to envisage a solution to endsuch tragedies and to respond to the aspirations of thepeoples of the region as long as the Arab-Israeli conflictcontinued to prevail in the absence of a just andcomprehensive peace.Many people do not know how many internationalendeavours were made  how many meetings wereconvened  how many parties contributed  how manyletters were sent and assurances given before agreementwas reached between the parties on the foundations andrules that made up the terms of reference of the Madrid8Peace Conference. It is now five years since the MadridConference was convened and  in turn  bilateral negotiationsset up. Those negotiations survived various periods oftension  interruption  set-back — and progress. Theygenerated thousands of pages of records. Both Syria andIsrael agreed on Israel’s withdrawal from the Golan back tothe boundary of 4 June 1967. Negotiations then proceededto the other elements of peace — all under the supervisionof the United States of America  and with its participation.Now  after all those international efforts  which wereunprecedented in the history of the Arab-Israeli conflict  anew Government has taken office in Israel. It has set itselfthe opposite course to that of its predecessor  and hasdeclared “no” three times: no to withdrawal from theGolan; no to withdrawal from occupied Palestinian lands;and no to a Palestinian State.To anyone who has followed the declarations andpractices of the Israeli Government since it assumed power it is clear that it has not wasted a single opportunity tounderline its insistence on changing the foundations andrules of the peace process  to attempt to demolish all theachievements of the past five years and to call for a returnto negotiations from square one  without preconditions —in other words  without the Madrid terms of reference  inaccordance with the “peace for peace” formula  with theobjective of imposing its fait accompli on the Arabs.President Hafez Al-Assad has said:“If this is what the Israeli Prime Minister has inmind  why should Syria want peace? If peace does notreturn the land to its rightful owners  why should wecall for it? Can any thinking person in this worldexpect Syria to establish peace with the IsraeliGovernment while Syrian land remains in Israelihands? That is why I say that if Netanyahu stays thatcourse  I do not believe there is any window for a justand comprehensive peace in the region.”One of the dilemmas facing the Middle East peaceprocess is that certain Israeli leaders are encouraging  ratherthan discouraging  extremism in Israeli society. They arethe ones who add fuel to the fire whenever a better climatefor the achievement of peace begins to develop. There aremany examples of such an attitude  which we do not havetime to provide today. It is sufficient to recall that in theaftermath of the Hebron massacre voices were raisedeverywhere  even in Israel itself  calling for the Jewishsettlers  who number less than 400  to move from the heartof Hebron  which is home to more than 120 000Palestinians. However  the Israeli Government refused towithdraw from Hebron  portraying such a move as theultimate painful concession.The bloody confrontations that broke out followingthe opening of the tunnel that Israel dug under the wall ofthe Al-Aqsa Mosque  as well as previous deliberate Israeliprovocations and the unjustified escalation of tensionsagainst Syria and Lebanon over the past few weeks  allconfirm that the Israeli Government did not take office inorder to resume peace negotiations on the basis ofinternational legitimacy  the Madrid terms of referenceand the “land-for-peace” formula  but rather in order tolaunch new negotiations with no terms of reference entrenching a fait accompli.During his European tour  Prime Minister Netanyahuannounced that his decision to open the tunnel wasdesigned merely to ease the movement of tourists andspare them a walk of a few dozen extra metres. Imaginehow guilty those tourists would feel if they believed that in order to secure their comfort  the Israeli authoritieskilled about 80 Palestinians  caused the deaths of 15Israelis  and wounded more than a thousand people. Theywould not  of course  believe it; we do not believe it —and neither does the head of the Israeli Government  whorevealed his true expansionist intentions when he laterclaimed that the tunnel had been there for two thousandyears  and arrogantly declared that it would remain openfor ever.Perhaps the huge number of innocent victims whofell in Jerusalem and in the towns of the West Bank andGaza have hastened the unmasking of such deceit. In thisway the Israeli Government appears to public opinion asit truly is: neither desirous of a just peace nor keen topursue it. This was reflected in the statements made bymany Foreign Ministers in the Security Council  whereIsrael appeared totally isolated  besieged on all sides bystatements deploring and denouncing its action  with thevoices that usually volunteer to defend it dying away.The Israeli Government’s fuelling of extremism didnot stop there. General Sharon  the Israeli Minister forInfrastructure  issued a decision last week allocating threenew sites on the occupied Syrian Golan for building 600housing units. Perhaps a large segment of internationalpublic opinion and some politicians are not aware thatwithout the financial aid and huge governmental subsidiesgiven to Jewish settlers  they would not settle in theGolan  especially as they are well aware that the Golan is9Syrian territory  which they will have to leave sooner orlater.Given my comments  it might be concluded that theIsraeli Government has no strategy for peace but has  itseems  chosen the path of confrontation. The path ofconfrontation  however  is very costly for several reasons.First  Israel can start a war whenever it chooses  but cannotend it when it chooses. Israel might wreak considerabledestruction here and there  but it can never destroy the willof a nation that has deep roots of civilization which spreadall over the world. Many Israelis may be unaware that allthe wars they have fought between October 1973 and April1996 have gained them nothing except human and politicallosses and further international condemnation.Secondly  the path of confrontation is very costlybecause the international community rejects war andaggression and calls for the achievement of a just andcomprehensive peace in the Middle East. Israel knows thatthe Arabs have opted for peace as their strategic option including at the summit level. In taking this stand they havebeen supported by the summit of the States of the Non-Aligned Movement  the summit of the European Union andthe summit of the Group of Seven industrial countries  allof which have stressed the need to adhere to thefoundations of the peace process  relevant Security Councilresolutions and the “land-for-peace” formula  as well asrespect by the parties for the agreements and commitmentsreached so far.Given these facts  it would be unacceptable if peacewere not also a strategic option for Israel — indeed  itwould be a real catastrophe. The achievement of a just andcomprehensive peace  to which the peoples of the regionand the world aspire  requires Israel’s withdrawal from alloccupied Arab land  pursuant to Security Councilresolutions 242 (1967)  338 (1973) and 425 (1978).Syria reaffirms its attachment to the unity of both theterritory and the people of Iraq. Syria rejects any attempt toviolate the unity and territorial integrity of Iraq’s territoryor to interfere in its internal affairs  including the attemptto establish a so-called security zone in northern Iraq. Syriaalso calls for an end to the suffering of the brotherly Iraqipeople  and for a continuation of the implementation ofSecurity Council resolutions  including a solution to theissue of Kuwaiti detainees.With regard to the Lockerbie crisis  Syria expresses itsconcern for the human and material harm that has beendone to the brotherly people of Libya as a result of thecontinuing coercive measures imposed on them by theSecurity Council. Syria reaffirms the statement made inthe final declaration on the issue of the recent Arabsummit  and calls for a response to the initiativesubmitted by the Arab League for solving this crisis.Syria hopes that the United Arab Emirates and theIslamic Republic of Iran can find a peaceful solution tothe crisis over the three islands in a way that willpreserve good-neighbourly relations and contribute to thestrengthening of security and stability in the region.Syria expresses its support for the principles agreedupon by the Governments of Yemen and Eritrea for asolution to their conflict through international arbitration.Our position flows from our desire for good-neighbourlyrelations between them and our belief in the importanceof re-establishing security and stability in the Red Searegion.Syria also expresses its concern at the continuingdeterioration of the situation in Somalia and reiterates thecall of the Arab summit to the leaders of the Somalifactions to achieve national reconciliation and to worktowards the establishment of a national authorityrepresenting our brothers  the Somali people  as a whole.With regard to Korea  Syria expresses its support formeasures that would guarantee peace and stability in theKorean peninsula and for the aspirations of the Koreanpeople to reunification.The celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of thefounding of the United Nations provided an importantopportunity for us to forge a common vision of the futureof international relations. On that occasion  we said thatthe crisis facing the United Nations does not arise fromthe purposes and principles of the Charter  but rather fromthe United Nations decision-making mechanism and theselective way in which decisions are implemented. Wealso observed that the Organization’s serious financialcrisis is  in fact  merely the reflection of a political crisisthat essentially revolves around the identity of the UnitedNations and its role in the post-cold-war era.In the light of those comments  the obvious questionis: Will it be possible to introduce meaningful reformsinto the structure of the United Nations that areacceptable and satisfactory to Member States? That is thetrue challenge  requiring that we all strive to strengthendialogue and international cooperation. This will ensure10that reforms take place which fulfil  in substance and inform  the aspirations of Member States.Today  as we stand on the threshold of the nextcentury  we are all faced with serious challenges thatrequire us to create an environment that will allow futuregenerations to live in peace  security and cooperation withina system of international relations free from violence andconfrontation. That is the hope of our peoples. This is whatwe must endeavour to achieve as we look forward to abetter future  one both more just and more humane that willbenefit all mankind."
"159",6700,"TCD",51,1996,"﻿First of all  I would like to congratulate you  Sir  on behalfof my delegation  upon your election to the presidency ofthe General Assembly at this session. Your selection is notonly a recognition of the contributions of your country Malaysia  in the defence of the ideals of the United Nationsbut is also a confirmation of your talents as an experienceddiplomat.Allow me also to express my thanks to yourpredecessor  Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral  for his masterfulguidance of the historic commemorative session of thefiftieth anniversary of the United Nations.I would like to pay once again a well-deserved tributeto our Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  andto reiterate our support for his constant efforts on behalf ofpeace and development.May I also transmit to our Assembly the message ofhope and the wishes for success of the President of theRepublic of Chad  General Idriss Deby.The life of a nation is often stamped by eventswritten in golden letters in the great book of their history.1996 is going to be one of those pivotal years along theroad to democracy in Chad. Indeed  at preceding sessions Chadian delegations regularly informed our Assembly ofthe substantial progress achieved in this area. I can affirmto you today that the process is ongoing  is gettingstronger and becoming day by day an irreversible reality.I offer as proof the two major elections that took placepeacefully and quietly.First  last March  the people of Chad gained aConstitution that then gave them the opportunity to electfreely and democratically for the first time in theirhistory  with direct universal suffrage  a President of theRepublic from among 15 candidates. Yes  after two hard-fought rounds of voting the people of Chad chosePresident Idriss Deby  who was officially inaugurated asPresident of the Republic of Chad on 8 August 1996 fora term of five years.Nonetheless  the process is still under way. Beforethe end of the year the people of Chad will be calledupon to elect their representatives to the future nationalassembly. The parliamentary election will bring to a closethe first phase in the establishment of the institutionscalled for by the Constitution.Numerous international observers were present inour country during the elections. They observed that theelections took place properly and that the Chadiansshowed discipline and political maturity. The organizationof the elections would not have been possible without thecontributions of Chad’s traditional friends  most notably France  the United Nations system and international andnon-governmental organizations. This contributionsupplemented the efforts of the Government of Chaditself  which  despite its serious economic and financialconstraints  assumed a part of the financing of theoperations. Here we wish to thank all those whosemultifaceted support and assistance made it possible toachieve these happy results. I take this opportunity toagain appeal urgently to the international community tosupport Chad in the organization of future elections  inparticular the legislative elections scheduled for nextDecember.4It is often said that there can be no lasting economicdevelopment without democracy. The latter  as we allknow  is a long  evolving process. Thus  slowly  patiently at its own pace and in the light of its own realities  Chad isproviding itself with the democratic institutions that mustsupport its socio-economic development efforts  which isthe highest priority of the programme of action of theGovernment of Chad.Thus  like a host of other countries  Chad hasdeveloped  in collaboration with the Bretton Woodsinstitutions  a structural adjustment programme. It has alsojust negotiated and concluded with the Paris Club ofIndustrial Country Creditors a partial deferment andrescheduling of its public debt. These actions are designedto control Government expenditure and ultimately to reducethe current budget deficit. The main goal is to arrive at asurplus which would allow Chad to build the basicinfrastructures which are essential to the promotion anddevelopment of economic activities. The Government ofChad is also re-energizing its private sector  whichgenerates employment  privatizing State enterprises andvigorously reforming tax-collection services and economicdevelopment programmes.Another concern of my Government is the constantquest for peace and security. As the Assembly knows  warhas stalked my country for more than two decades  whichhas completely undermined its structures. This is why wemust work to restore peace and security  which inevitablyinvolves regaining control of the army. I can affirm to theAssembly that efforts have been made and are continuingto this end. Thanks to friendly countries and the WorldBank  more than 21 000 soldiers have been demobilized  anoperation which will continue. However  our demobilizationefforts will be in vain if this means putting out onto thestreet men who know how to handle weapons and arecapable of causing unrest and insecurity. This is why aprogramme to reintegrate them into society must beimplemented immediately. Only then will the reformprogramme succeed and ensure that we have a disciplinedarmy  a true melting pot of the nation  at the service ofdevelopment: this is our ambition.The aftermath of war must be overcome  and at thetop of our list of priorities is to de-mine an area equivalentto one quarter of our national territory. The mines plantedduring the occupation of part of our country continueindiscriminately to kill and mutilate civilians  women andchildren in particular. This is an alarming situation becauseit hinders any development programme in a region which nonetheless  has enormous potential for mining and tourism.It goes without saying that national rehabilitationcannot succeed  once again  without the assistance of theinternational community.As far as my country is concerned  and despite theproblems I have just mentioned  Chad is resolutelydetermined to work for sustainable socio-economicdevelopment. The people of Chad  in an atmosphere ofpeace and freedom  decided to unite for the sake of theirown development. To this end  we would like to seeincreasing external assistance  so designed to help us toreach the point where we no longer need such assistance.Help us to develop  so that we do not become too greata burden on the countries represented here. That is ourmessage to the developed countries.The international situation is also of concern to us.Chad is not alone in the world  and what happens in thatworld  even if it is beyond us and if matters are settledoutside Chad  concerns us all the same. The rampantcrises in various parts of the world raise the question ofwhat became of the hopes that were raised by the end ofthe cold war. We in Africa applaud the progress towardsrestoring peace and security in countries such asMozambique  Angola and Liberia. But these achievementshave to be consolidated. We can do this if we mobilizeourselves and shoulder our responsibilities.We deplore the situation of latent war in Somaliaand the Great Lakes region. Genuine efforts should bemade by the international community; the parties involvedalso need to show political will to end their fratricidalconfrontations.The challenge is the same in Bosnia andHerzegovina  where implementation of the Dayton PeaceAgreement must be vigorously supported so that apermanent peace can be established in that part of theworld.In the Middle East  the peace process which beganwith Israeli and Palestinian reconciliation seems to havebeen thrown into question in the light of events in recentweeks. We pay tribute to the very recent diplomaticinitiatives to try and restore dialogue between thedifferent parties  despite the lukewarm results. Chadexhorts them to respect their commitments to avoid a newflare-up in the region.My country fully endorses the numerous effortsmade with regard to disarmament. Thus we welcomedwith satisfaction the African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone5Treaty signed in Cairo  the non-aggression pact in CentralAfrica signed in Yaoundé and the adoption here in NewYork of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty which Chad signed this very morning.Similarly  faced with the horror caused by mines those deadly devices  Chad welcomes the initiatives takento eliminate them. Consequently  we are prepared tosupport any measure to that end.The 1990s will have been devoted to attempts to findglobal solutions to the serious economic  social andenvironmental problems facing part of humankind. Chad  asa Sahelian country  welcomes the entry into force of theConvention to Combat Desertification in Those CountriesExperiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification particularly in Africa and hopes to see rapid implementationof its provisions.We also hope that the forthcoming World FoodSummit will meet expectations in terms of food securityand water management  issues which give rise to oftendeadly conflict. Moreover  we should meet the newchallenges facing the world: drugs  organized crime pandemics  terrorism and religious intolerance. Increasedinternational cooperation seems essential if we are toeliminate these scourges which Governments cannot dealwith individually.Here  I would like to congratulate the United NationsChildren’s Fund for its actions on behalf of children  inparticular its vaccination programmes  including theprogramme to eradicate poliomyelitis before the year 2000.We also encourage the World Health Organization to stepup its efforts to contain and eliminate the modernpandemic  AIDS.The fiftieth anniversary of our Organization providedan opportunity for the international community to thinkabout the future  reform and how to re-energize the UnitedNations.But  like all human activities  only by making all thisa reality will our Organization be able to achieve the idealsof peace  security and well-being laid down in the Charterand to which our peoples aspire.I cannot conclude without joining with manypreceding speakers in paying tribute to the immense workdone over the last four years by our Secretary-General Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali. His action on all fronts  and theavailability  willingness and courage of the Secretary-General have enabled our Organization to foresee andresolve many conflicts. In that connection  I want to makeit very clear that our country  Chad  will support theSecretary-General without reservation."
"160",6746,"TGO",51,1996,"﻿First of all  I would like to express to the President mysincere and warm congratulations upon his election to thepresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-firstsession. My delegation is convinced that his skills  hisperfect mastery of international issues and his unstintingefforts will bring the work of our session to a satisfactoryconclusion. In the same context  I would like to assurehim of my delegation’s readiness to cooperate with himin the discharge of his lofty mission.It is also a pleasure for me to commend theremarkable work done by his predecessor  Mr. DiogoFreitas do Amaral  who stamped the fiftieth session withthe seal of his effectiveness and dedication. I pay tributeto him on behalf of my delegation.I would also like to congratulate Secretary-GeneralBoutros Boutros-Ghali for the noteworthy way in whichhe has devoted his energies to the achievement of theobjectives of our Organization and to enhancing day byday its credibility. He has all the respect of the Togolesedelegation.The economic  political and social context of thissession hardly seems to differ from that of previous years:the ongoing conflicts continue to take many victims.Moreover  terrorism continues to have a great impact onthe world  and the burden of debt  with all itsimplications  holds in check the development of manycountries  particularly those of Africa. All thesephenomena cast a shadow over the international landscapeand prompt concerns regarding the genuine advent ofpeace  security and prosperity  to which all of humanitylegitimately aspires.It is in this context that Togo has endeavoured toconsolidate the basis of a state of law and to confront theimperatives of sustainable human development to ensurethe social well-being of its people.Togo has begun the process of democratizingnational political life  and the process has had a normaland encouraging development  particularly in the lastthree years. The calm  orderly and transparent holding ofpartial legislative elections on 4 and 18 August 1996illustrates the resolve of the Togolese people  with theimpetus of the Head of State  Mr. Gnassingbe Eyadema 16to move forward along the road to democracy  peace andpolitical stability  which guarantee social and economicdevelopment.Having learned the lessons of a difficult democratictransition  which ripped the social fabric and cast into doubtthe achievements of its development process  the populationof Togo is more aware than ever before of the need topreserve and strengthen its unity. By doing so it will beable to effectively meet present and future challenges ensure its prosperity and make its modest contribution tothe building of a better world. The President of theRepublic and the Government of Togo intend to continueto work tirelessly in this direction  in concert with othermembers of the international community. They are satisfiedto note today that the people of Togo  through the hardshipsthat they have endured  have acquired a clear awareness ofself-responsibility. Thus  having supported the efforts oftheir leaders for several months  they more and more firmlyreject political formulas and organization approachesdesigned in other climes that have proved unsuitable in thecontext of their history and culture. In the view of manyobservers  the Togolese people  through the countlessmanifestations of its political will  is cultivating theauthentic African democracy that we all desire.Last year the United Nations commemorated thefiftieth anniversary of its founding. On that occasion  theGeneral Assembly observed in its Declaration:“The determination  enshrined in the Charter of theUnited Nations  to save succeeding generations fromthe scourge of war' is as vital today as it was fiftyyears ago.” (resolution 50/6  first para.)The many ethnic or religious armed conflicts that still scarthe international landscape confirm this view of the GeneralAssembly and demonstrate the magnitude of the task stillfacing the Organization.Africa remains one of the world’s regions of tension and our continent has been sorely tested by cruel conflictspersisting in a number of States. The Government of Togodeplores the fact that conflicts such as those in Liberia Sierra Leone  Somalia  Burundi and Angola have not yetbeen definitively resolved. The huge numbers of victims refugees  displaced persons and the massive destructioncaused by these conflicts should be enough to convince theparties concerned of the need to put an end to theirdisputes  which could tire the patience and perseverance ofthe international community in its efforts.Concerned over the deteriorating situation in thesecountries  the Togolese Government urges the variousactors to seek a peaceful solution to their disputes through dialogue and cooperation  so that their peoplescan at last find the peace and stability necessary for theirdevelopment.With respect more specifically to Liberia  mydelegation welcomes the bold measures taken by theCommittee of Nine of the Economic Community of WestAfrican States (ECOWAS) at its meeting in Abuja lastAugust  aimed at successfully concluding the peaceprocess begun many years ago. These measures accompanied by sanctions  attest to the determination ofthe ECOWAS countries to do their utmost to find adefinitive and lasting solution to this fratricidal andseemingly endless conflict.At this new stage of the process  it is important forour Liberian brothers to recognize the tremendous effortsmade by the ECOWAS States  the Organization ofAfrican Unity (OAU) and the United Nations  and toshow good will in order to facilitate the effectiveimplementation of the Abuja Agreement of 19 August1995  which provides the means to end this conflict andto return to peace and to constitutional normalcy.With respect to the dispute over the Bakassipeninsula  my country would like to pay tribute to theSecretary-General’s efforts towards a peaceful settlement.These efforts  which recently took the form of thedispatch of a good-offices mission to Cameroon  Nigeria Bakassi and Togo  may help strengthen the interimmeasures aimed at reducing tensions  while waiting for ajudgement to be handed down by the International Courtof Justice.Togo is determined to work towards resolving allconflicts by peaceful means and to safeguard peace andsecurity on the African continent. Thus my country andits President are prepared to contribute to the restorationof peace on the peninsula and to the normalization ofrelations between the two countries. In the same spirit  theGovernment of Togo hopes that the good will shown bythe two parties during the visit of the Secretary-General’sgood-offices mission will continue to prevail  so that thedesired goal may be achieved as soon as possible.The persistence of these conflicts  which deeplyundermine our continent’s development efforts  compelsme to recall the proposal made at the thirtieth session ofthe OAU conference of Heads of State and Government17by President Gnassingbe Eyadema of Togo aimed atestablishing an inter-African force charged with keeping thepeace wherever it is threatened or breached.We welcome the various initiatives undertaken to thatend to make this idea a reality  so that Africa  with thesupport of the international community  might bettermanage conflict situations  which divert the efforts of theAfrican peoples from the priorities of economic and socialdevelopment.Along the same lines  given the numerous conflicts theOAU Mechanism for Conflict Prevention  Management andResolution will have to face and in light of the illicittrafficking in small arms and light weapons  it is importantto strengthen the activities of the United Nations RegionalCentre for Peace and Disarmament in Africa  headquarteredin Togo. To that end  it would be appropriate if the Centre established pursuant to resolution 40/151 G of 16 December1985 by the General Assembly at the request of OAUHeads of State and Government  could benefit fromadequate and appropriate resources so that it could fullydischarge its duties. In that context  I should like toreaffirm that the Government of Togo  which attaches greatimportance to this Centre  will do its utmost to honour itscommitments as the host country.The 1991 Madrid Peace Conference on the MiddleEast and the Washington agreements of 13 September 1993 inter alia  have sparked hopes regarding a negotiatedsettlement of the question of Palestine and the conflict inthe Middle East as a whole. The evacuation of certainoccupied territories of Palestine  the establishment of thePalestinian Authority  the repeal of anti-Israel provisionsfrom the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) charter and the peace treaty between Israel and Jordan  are positiveoccurrences that bear witness to the progress achieved inthe context of the Middle East peace process. Togowelcomes this progress.However  the difficulties that have confronted thisprocess in the last few days  jeopardizing its normaldevelopment  are a source of grave concern for mydelegation. The delegation of Togo is particularly concernedat the tragic events that took place last week in Jerusalem which claimed many Palestinian and Israeli victims.Togo  which endorses Security Council resolution1073 (1996)  adopted on 28 September 1996  calls forgreater energy in the continuation of the process until itachieves concrete results. It urges the evacuation of alloccupied Arab territories  the existence of Israel withinsecure and internationally recognized borders  and theestablishment of an independent Palestinian state. At anyrate  it is important to achieve a just and comprehensivepeace benefiting all countries of the region  in accordancewith the relevant resolutions of the Security Council.With respect to the war in the former Yugoslavia  Ishould like on behalf of the Togolese Government toheartily congratulate the architects of the DaytonAgreement  signed in Paris on 14 December 1995  and toexpress our appreciation at the acceptable development ofthe situation in the light of the implementation of thatAgreement. We would like to encourage the main actorsin that conflict to continue to seek a negotiated settlementaimed at a definitive return to peace and stability in thatpart of Europe.Aside from hotbeds of tension  we must note thatterrorism  which we condemn  is  because of itspernicious objectives and criminal acts  one of the gravestthreats today to international peace and security. Wewelcome the holding of the Summit for Peacemakers inSharm el-Sheikh and the recent meeting of the Ministersfor Foreign Affairs of the Group of 7 major industrializedcountries and of the Russian Federation in Paris. TheGovernment of Togo welcomes the various measuresadvocated at these two meetings in order to energeticallythwart the activities of transnational criminalorganizations and their agents.With respect to the safeguarding of peace throughdisarmament  Togo reiterates its firm commitment togeneral and complete disarmament  and supportsunreservedly the efforts of the international community toachieve that objective. In this connection  my delegationconsiders that the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-BanTreaty (CTBT)  opened for signature by States on 24September 1996  and which I have just signed on behalfof the Government of Togo  will undoubtedly contribute if it is accepted and applied by all  to a reduction of thenuclear threat. This would allow the internationalcommunity to make headway towards the definitiveelimination of nuclear weapons  which is one of the mostardent wishes of humanity.As the Declaration on the Occasion of the FiftiethAnniversary of the United Nations states:“A dynamic  vigorous  free and equitableinternational economic environment is essentialto the well-being of humankind and to18international peace  security and stability.”(resolution 50/6  para. 2)This unanimous recognition of the positive effects thata sound international economic climate can have on worldstability is absolutely accurate. The growing indifference ofa large part of the international community to the search forappropriate solutions to the current economic crisis isbecoming increasingly disturbing. Indeed  while in theindustrialized countries the overall socio-economic situationis experiencing positive developments and while thedisparities in their economic performances are decreasing we note with regret that the developing countries particularly in those of Africa  still languish under the debtburden and have great difficulty in extricating themselvesfrom the situation they have been in for several years.As has been repeatedly pointed out  the solution to theeconomic problems of the developing countries requiresradical and innovative solutions  inter alia  the cancellationor appreciable reduction of their debts and theimplementation of bold measures aimed at promoting theirprogress.My delegation welcomes the efforts made so far bycreditors to resolve the debt problem. It appreciates theresolve expressed by the seven major industrializedcountries at the G-7 Lyons Summit to take additional actionto reduce the debt burden of the poorest countries vis-à-vismultilateral institutions and bilateral creditors that are notmembers of the Paris Club. It welcomes in particular therecent decision of the Ministers for Finance of the sevenmajor industrialized countries  at their meeting inWashington  to alleviate the debt burden of the poorestcountries  up to a limit of 80 per cent.Aside from the question of debt  my delegation is alsoconcerned with other problems of development. Aware thatthey are primarily responsible for promoting their owndevelopment through sound and consistent economic andsocial policies  the developing countries involved instructural adjustment programmes have made enormoussacrifices  which  unfortunately  have not yet achieved thedesired results. Thus most of these countries face serioussocial problems  including endemic disease  hunger unemployment  a high number of unemployed graduates strident claims by its citizens and poverty.To confront and resolve these various ills in a lastingmanner  the international community must show greatersolidarity and mobilize  together with these countries  torender them the necessary assistance. Moreover  in orderfor it to take off economically  Africa must stop beingviewed as just a reservoir of raw materials.At this time of globalization of the economy and theliberalization of markets  it is imperative that AfricanStates become competitive in international trade. To thisend  they must meet the challenges of industrialdevelopment through sustained technical and financialcooperation with the industrialized countries. Moreover it is important that Africa not become dependent on theexploitation of raw materials  whose prices are constantlydeteriorating. The pace of its industrialization must beencouraged to accelerate through international cooperationbased on partnership and the support of developedcountries  development-related bodies and the relevantmultilateral financial institutions.In that connection  the Government of Togo  whichcreated and continues to strengthen conditions that favourforeign investment in its free zone  inter alia  would liketo express its gratitude to both its public and privatepartners and to the industrial development institutionsthat  through their investments and various forms ofassistance  have supported its initiatives in this domain.The World Food Summit will be held in Rome nextNovember. The Government of Togo hopes that the workof the Summit will meet with success and that therecommendations that will be adopted there will help toimprove the food and agricultural situation so that theneeds of peoples in this sphere can be met.Togo welcomes the United Nations System-wideSpecial Initiative on Africa  launched on 15 March 1996by the Secretary-General. We see in this initiative aconfirmation of the commitment of the Secretary-Generaland the United Nations system to give concrete reality tothe objectives of the San Francisco Charter in order inter alia  to support development in Africa.At a time when the economic and social situation ofAfrica is constantly deteriorating  it is important to dulyappreciate this Special Initiative promoting a partnershipbetween political and economic institutions and AfricanGovernments. One of the Initiative’s good points is thatit deals substantively with problems and focuses primarilyon action towards peace  political stability anddevelopment on the continent. However  in order for it toachieve its objectives  the international community mustbecome effectively involved in its implementation bymaking a decisive contribution to the mobilization of thenecessary financial resources  so that it does not become19simply just another initiative for Africa. My Governmentwill devote the necessary attention to it in order to turn thesituation to best account.In today’s world  where nations are confronted withthe paradox of fragmentation and globalization  the UnitedNations  more than ever before  has a key role to play.Thus  in connection with the severe lack of resources thathas brought the United Nations to the brink of bankruptcy my Government is among those which believes that noreform of the Organization can succeed if the Organizationhas to fight for its own survival. It is therefore urgent thatdrastic measures be taken to ensure a stable financial basefor the Organization and to put a definitive end to thispayments crisis  which has paralysed it. The principal Statesin arrears should show the political will to help resolve thecrisis.In the view of my delegation  improved effectivenessof the United Nations is a must; but it is also important topromote its democratization. We believe  therefore  that theWorking Group on the Question of EquitableRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of theSecurity Council is proceeding in the right direction. Giventhe present configuration of the United Nations  and asnoted by the Working Group  it is necessary to contemplatean equitable and responsible increase in the number ofpermanent and non-permanent members of the Council andto strengthen its links with the main organs of the UnitedNations and with the Member States  so as to enhancetransparency.For many decades  thanks to the sustained efforts ofthe United Nations  multilateralism has clearly been themost appropriate framework for resolving problems relatingto international peace and security and to development.The balance sheet drawn up last year  on the fiftiethanniversary of the Organization  was encouraging despitecertain shortcomings. Nevertheless  much remains to bedone. Greater efforts are required on the part of MemberStates  as well as greater resources  so that a reformed andrevitalized United Nations  better adapted to currentrealities  can respond effectively to the expectations ofhumanity as a whole.In the discharge of the lofty mission assigned to theOrganization  Togo  for its part  will associate itself withoutreservation to any initiative aimed at safeguardinginternational peace and security and promoting justice human rights and progress for the benefit of all nations."
"161",6791,"THA",51,1996,"﻿On behalf of theGovernment and people of Thailand  I should like to extendmy warmest congratulations to Your Excellency upon yourelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at itsfifty-first session  which marks the beginning of the nexthalf-century for the United Nations. I am confident that with your leadership and guidance  this session will marka successful beginning for the work of the United Nationsin the next 50 years and in the new century.From what we have seen so far  you are already off toa good start. By insisting on beginning our meetings ontime over the past three weeks and not succumbing to thetraditional half-hour delay before starting the meetings  youhave  in effect  prevented the wastage of both time andmoney for the United Nations and its Member States. Thisact is truly an admirable display of leadership. Mydelegation looks forward to seeing more such constructiveinitiatives in the future.As a close neighbour of Malaysia and a fellowmember of the Association of South-East Asian Nations Thailand is particularly pleased to see you in this importantoffice. You can count on my delegation’s fullestcooperation in all your endeavours at this session.My delegation also wishes to take this opportunity toexpress its sincere appreciation to Mr. Diogo Freitasdo Amaral of Portugal  the President of the historic fiftiethsession of the General Assembly  for his mostcommendable efforts in making the fiftieth session andthe fiftieth anniversary year of the United Nations trulymonumental and fruitful.My delegation is especially grateful to Mr. Freitasdo Amaral for his role in facilitating the work of theGeneral Assembly’s working groups on the reform of theUnited Nations  particularly the Open-ended WorkingGroup on the Question of Equitable Representation onand Increase in the Membership of the Security Counciland other matters related to the Security Council. Underhis stewardship  that Working Group was able to adopt for the first time  a substantive and comprehensive reportwhich was acceptable to all.As we enter the next half-century of the UnitedNations and the closing years of the twentieth century  itis becoming increasingly clear that we  our children andgrandchildren will soon be living in a new era that is verydifferent from today’s. The last decades of this centuryhave set the stage for a major shift in global paradigmsthat will forever change the way in which we live andwork.In recent years  events such as the populationexplosion  the ebbing of the ideological tide and thetechnological and communications revolution havebrought to the fore such issues as the management offood and resources  preservation of the environment  theneed to improve income distribution  education and healthcare  and the promotion of civil rights and equalities democracy and good governance.In the United Nations and elsewhere  there is a clearindication that the prominence of such issues willcontinue into the next century and beyond. If we are to beable to address these issues  deal with them in an efficientmanner  go through the transition and adjust ourselves tothe paradigm shift  we need a concerted andcomprehensive approach. This approach should beproactive rather than reactive and should be able toprovide a new course of action for future generations.The development and implementation of such anapproach require leadership at the global level. As theonly international body that deals with a vast array ofglobal issues on a daily basis  the United Nations is in aunique position to provide that leadership.Thailand is convinced that  in order to be able toassume a leadership role  it is imperative that the United3Nations first be reformed and revitalized at all threelevels — intergovernmental  organizational and managerial.It is for these reasons that Thailand attaches greatimportance to the work of the General Assembly’s fiveworking groups on United Nations reform. Thailandbelieves that  if given the necessary political will andcooperation from Member States  each of these workinggroups will soon be able to make specific recommendationsto the General Assembly that would serve as salientelements of a single comprehensive reform package.It is unfortunate  however  that  in spite of the fact thatmost of these working groups have been in existence fortwo to three years  a compromise on crucial issues isnowhere in sight. Furthermore  should this trend continue it is unlikely that we will see any substantial achievementfrom these working groups in the near future.This desolate scenario is certainly detrimental to thefuture of the United Nations  especially when we aremerely a few steps away from the next century. It is thebelief of my delegation that  if we are to make any progressin the work of the working groups  the time is now. Themore we hesitate and bicker  the less chance there will beof any meaningful reform of the United Nations.Due to the lack of progress in the work of some of theworking groups  some Member States have begun tosuggest that deadlines be imposed on their work. Thailanddoes not believe that such deadlines are necessary. In fact Thailand believes that  within a year or two  if no seriouscompromise is to be found  the momentum for reformefforts will simply wither away. At that point  we will nolonger have to worry about deadlines or the efficiency andeffectiveness of the United Nations in managing itself andin dealing with twenty-first-century issues. Without thenecessary reforms  the fate of the United Nations is sealed.My delegation therefore wishes to call upon all fellowMember States to redouble their efforts  in the spirit ofcooperation and compromise and for the benefit of thegreater whole  to help facilitate the work of the workinggroups in the hope that  in the very near future  they will beable to come up with practical recommendations to theGeneral Assembly and that  eventually  a comprehensivereform package can be formulated. What is indispensablefor the twenty-first century is a more capable  morerepresentative  more accountable and better managed UnitedNations.Year after year  we speak about the need to reform theUnited Nations. Year after year  we come back to the sameproblem: the willingness or  to be more precise  the lack ofwillingness of Member States to see the United Nationsbecome what they themselves said the United Nationsshould become. The United Nations cannot be reformedsimply by lip-service. No meaningful reform of theUnited Nations can take place without the political material and financial support of its Members. The failureof Member States to meet their financial obligations tothe United Nations  in particular  not only undermines theUnited Nations ability to reform but  more importantly  inactuality is the root cause of some of the United Nationscurrent inefficiencies. It is for this reason that mydelegation finds it politically and legally unacceptable forMember States intentionally to withhold their assessedcontributions to the United Nations on any groundswhatsoever.When my delegation speaks about United Nationsleadership  we are referring specifically to two sources ofleadership. The first is the General Assembly  as it is themost universal and  undeniably  the most important organof the United Nations. The other is the Secretary-Generalas the chief administrative officer of the Organization.As far as the General Assembly is concerned  mydelegation believes that it is essential that thepre-eminence of the General Assembly vis-à-vis otherprincipal organs of the United Nations continue to beemphasized. This pre-eminence should be not only inwords  but also in reality. The General Assembly must bethe ultimate decision-making body on all importantquestions  as specified in the Charter  and not simply arubber stamp for decisions or agreements concoctedelsewhere. The General Assembly must truly be the voiceof and moral compass for the international community.As for the Secretary-General  my delegation is of theview that the twenty-first century demands that the chiefexecutive officer of the United Nations be someone withexemplary courage and vision. That person must have thecourage to take bold initiatives  to stand up for what heor she believes is right as well as to promote and defendthe interest of the greater whole. He or she must have thevision and the managerial adeptness to turn the UnitedNations into one of the most efficient and purposefulinternational institutions of our time. Due to theincreasingly demanding responsibilities of the Secretary-General  Thailand is inclined to support the idea that theposts of Deputy Secretary-General be created and thatthese deputies be empowered to act on behalf of theSecretary-General in certain areas of his or heroverwhelming responsibilities. Moreover  in order to beable to perform his or her functions with full efficiency4and without the interference of undue external pressures  aUnited Nations Secretary-General should serve only oneterm in office  be it of five or seven years.Through close coordination and cooperation betweenthe General Assembly and the Secretary-General  acomprehensive approach for the future can be developedand implemented with efficiency. The development andimplementation of this new approach should be guided bythe main purposes of the United Nations  namely  themaintenance of international peace and security and thepromotion of global economic and social development.These dual responsibilities are the raisons d’étre of theUnited Nations. They have come to symbolize the effortstowards global cooperation and my delegation believes thattheir goals should continue to be pursued with vigour andthe fullest cooperation from United Nations Member States.In this connection  my delegation wishes to commendMr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  the Secretary-General  for hisinitiatives on “An Agenda for Peace” and “An Agenda forDevelopment”. By having the foresight to come up withthese very important documents in the early years of thisdecade  the Secretary-General has provided us withblueprints for the future upon which we can plan andvisualize a new direction for a new United Nations.As I pointed out earlier  there is a clear trend that themain issues that will confront us in the future are those ofeconomic and social development. The key concepts for thetwenty-first century are sustainable economic growth andsustainable human and social development. For this reason my delegation believes that now is the time for greaterattention to be given to these issues. This belief does notstem from the fact that Thailand herself is a developingcountry  but rather from the realization that a solideconomic and social foundation is an indispensableprerequisite for sustainable peace and prosperity.At the international level in particular  functionalcooperation in these areas could create a network ofinterdependence based on goodwill and mutual interests which could help eliminate conflicts and misunderstandings.It is with this belief that Thailand has consistently been astrong advocate of United Nations activities in the field ofeconomic and social development  as well as humanitarianactivities  and has been an active participant in the effortsto reform the mechanisms of the United Nations in theseareas. A good example of Thailand’s commitment to theUnited Nations development effort is her agreement to hostthe tenth session of the United Nations Conference onTrade and Development (UNCTAD) in the year 2000. Inthe meantime  we are pleased that the five majorinternational summits organized by the United Nations ranging from the United Nations Conference onEnvironment and Development (UNCED) in Rio deJaneiro in 1992 to Habitat II in Istanbul earlier this year have proved to be useful in enabling Member States tofocus on the various aspects of development and tocultivate a common vision and a comprehensive strategyfor cooperation among themselves. We hope that theoutcome of such conferences will help convince MemberStates of the need to render all necessary assistance andcooperation to the United Nations for its efforts in theseareas.But while we believe that international cooperationcould stimulate and promote development  we also believethat development efforts should  first and foremost  beginat home. As a developing country  Thailand has alwaysattached high importance to both economic growth andsocial development and has aspired to achieve anequilibrium between the two. This is evident in all ofThailand’s national development plans. Currently Thailandis entering its eighth five-year national economic andsocial development plan. We are particularly proud of thisplan  since  for the first time  the main focus is on humandevelopment: it is a human-centred national developmentplan. It is not by chance that the focus of this plancoincides with recent efforts of the United Nations andwith the United Nations development strategy spelt out inthe Secretary-General’s “An Agenda for Development”(A/48/935). In fact  the plan has been drawn up so as tocomplement and respond to development efforts at alllevels: local  national  regional and global.As a country of 60 million people  Thailand sees thathuman and social development are the keys to nationaldevelopment  since without any doubt a nation’s mostprecious resource is its citizens. For this reason  throughthe years the Thai Government  often under the directroyal guidance of His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej has been implementing hundreds of royal nationaldevelopment projects  ranging from environmentalprotection to education  from agriculture to public healthcare. Some of these projects  such as narcotic suppressionthrough the introduction of crop substitution  areinternationally recognized and are being implemented inclose cooperation with the United Nations and otherinternational agencies. As this is the year that the Thaination celebrates the fiftieth anniversary of His Majesty’sascension to the throne  we are more determined thanever to continue on this path and to rededicate ourselvesto advancing the cause which is so close to the heart of5our beloved monarch. Therefore  in the years aheadThailand will continue to work hard and to cooperateclosely with the international community in order to realizethe goals of sustainable economic  human and socialdevelopment.An important instrument through which States canrealize their economic and social development goals isinternational trade. It is therefore essential that all States betreated with fairness and be given the same opportunities inthe international marketplace. This is the basic principlebehind the establishment of the World Trade Organization.However  what we see now is a disturbing tendency on thepart of some States to use non-trade issues  such as humanrights and labour standards  as leverage in tradenegotiations. Even more alarmingly  we are seeing an effortby some to exercise extraterritorial powers throughdomestic legislation  impinging upon the freedom of otherStates to pursue independent foreign policies and tradingpractices.My delegation cannot emphasize strongly enough theimportance of keeping trade separate from other issues.Trade must remain free and open and not be held hostageto dissolute motives. Non-trade issues must not be broughtin to be used as a smokescreen disguising neo-protectionistpolicies and practices. To allow such a phenomenon tocontinue would only undo the gains that we have madeover the past half century.As mentioned above  Thailand believes in the time-proven notion that the benefits of functional cooperation inthe field of economic and social development could have apositive spillover effect on efforts for the maintenance ofinternational peace and security. However  this does notmean that Thailand is idly waiting for such an effect tomaterialize. On the contrary  as in the past  Thailand hascontinued to be active in the field of international peace andsecurity and follows with vigilance the political and securitydevelopments in various parts of the world. We are keepinga watchful eye on  among other things  the peace process inBosnia and Herzegovina  the fragile peace efforts in theMiddle East and the unfolding situations in such diverseplaces as Angola  Haiti and Eastern Slavonia  Baranja andWestern Sirmium.In particular  as a member of the Special Committeeon Peacekeeping Operations and the coordinator of theNon-Aligned Movement for this issue  Thailand is verymuch in support of the idea that the United Nations overallpolicy on peacekeeping should be re-examined. We believethat there should be clear guidelines and principles withregard to the scope  depth  objectives and mandates ofUnited Nations peacekeeping activities in order to ensurethat United Nations involvement in conflict situations willbe practical  meaningful and cost-effective.At a time when the United Nations is facing afinancial crisis  Thailand also supports the notion thatthere should be clear time-frames for United Nationspeacekeeping operations. Of the existing 16 UnitedNations peacekeeping operations  two date back to the1940s  one to the 1960s and two to the 1970s. These fivepeacekeeping operations  which have been running fordecades  have thus far cost the United Nations and itsMember States almost $240 million and  moreimportantly  the lives of 461 peacekeepers. Looking atthese figures  one cannot but wonder whether it is theUnited Nations that is not keeping the peace  or theparties involved that are not willing to have peace.Whatever the answer is  the international community ispaying a high price for these operations  without any endin sight.As international and internal conflicts rage on  thearmaments business continues to prosper. My delegationis gratified that the Disarmament Commission  at its 1996session  was able to adopt the guidelines for internationalarms transfers. Despite their lack of legal force  theguidelines are an important step towards eliminatingillegal armaments  especially small arms  which in ourlifetime have caused too many losses and too muchsuffering to peoples in all corners of the world.My delegation believes that  parallel to this effort toregulate the flow of arms  there should also be methodsof bringing to justice the perpetrators of crimes andviolence against humanity. It is in this belief that mydelegation welcomes the Economic and Social Council’sUnited Nations Declaration on crime and public securityas well as the efforts to establish an international criminalcourt. Even though these mechanisms will not make ourlives more secure  they nevertheless give us hope thatfrom now on there will be punishment to suit the crime.6As far as human destruction is concerned  nothing ismore terrifying than the threat of a nuclear holocaust. Forthis reason  my delegation is pleased that theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) has nowbeen adopted by the General Assembly and is currentlyopen for signature by interested States. Once in itsoperational phase  the Treaty will be an importantcomplement to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) which was extended indefinitely in 1995.However  neither the CTBT nor the NPT are adequateguarantees against the threat of a nuclear holocaust. Mydelegation believes that the only practical way to safeguardthe world against a nuclear catastrophe is to eliminate allnuclear weapons. This can be done on a step-by-step basiswithin a definite time-frame. As a starter  in the spirit ofthe advisory opinion of the International Court of Justiceearlier this year  we could deny the legality of the use orthe threat of use of nuclear weapons. Eventually  we canmake the total elimination of all nuclear weapons and theirdelivery systems  as well as of other weapons of massdestruction  a top priority for the twenty-first century.Last year  our Heads of State and Governmentgathered here to pay tribute to the United Nations for its 50years of service to humankind and to renew their pledge tocontinue to work with the United Nations to realize thehopes and dreams of the framers of the United NationsCharter. Through the Declaration adopted on that occasion our leaders also promised to“give to the twenty-first century a United Nationsequipped  financed and structured to serve effectivelythe peoples in whose name it was established”.(resolution 50/6  fifth preambular paragraph)Today  I am here to reaffirm that pledge and topropose further that the United Nations assume theleadership role that would help guide us into the nextcentury. In providing this leadership  the United Nationsneed not depart from what it has been doing for the past 50years. The United Nations should continue to do what itdoes best in areas such as the maintenance of internationalpeace and security; economic  human and socialdevelopment; humanitarian emergencies; promotion ofdemocracy and human rights; environmental protection; andtechnical cooperation. The only differences are that infuture the United Nations will have to do these things muchbetter and in a more effective and efficient manner. And more importantly  the Organization will have to project aclearer sense of purpose and direction  which will helpMember States and their peoples formulate a universal andcomprehensive approach to cope with the emergingparadigms of the twenty-first century.We are about to cross the threshold into a new andchallenging era. Through the leadership of the UnitedNations  we can turn the challenges into rewards andopportunities."
"162",6816,"TJK",51,1996,"﻿Allow me first to congratulate Mr. Razali Ismailon his election to the post of President of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-first session. We consider this toconstitute recognition by the community of nations of thegrowing role being played by Malaysia on the worldpolitical and economic scenes.The Republic of Tajikistan’s accession to full UnitedNations membership five years ago marked a new pagein the history of my country’s relations with theOrganization. Five years is  of course  a short period inhistory  but for our country they have been crucial. Forthe Tajik people  whose history over the past millenniumhas been full of tragic events  they were fraught withserious ordeals. These years saw both our breakthrough tosovereignty and one of the most tragic periods of ourmodern history: the civil war. Indeed  the question waswhether one of the newest Member States was to continueto exist on the world map.The people of Tajikistan answered this questionthemselves  but the historical cost of the survival of theyoung State  which became the object of massiveaggression from united extremist forces  including attackscarried out from the southern borders of theCommonwealth of Independent States (CIS)  was veryhigh.It is already clear today that the conflict imposed onthe Tajik people — an enormous human tragedy — wasaimed at undermining the newly emerging foundations ofthe State and interfering with economic growth andmarket reforms and hence the country’s independentdevelopment along a general democratic course. The scaleof the conflict and the degree of involvement of forcesfrom the territory of a neighbouring State posed a threatto peace and security on the Asian continent as a whole.Fortunately  in its difficult struggle for political survival Tajikistan was not left to fend for itself. The CISStates — primarily Russia and the central Asiancountries  as well as the United Nations and theOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe supported the Republic and continue to do so.23Today  the Government of the Republic of Tajikistanis concentrating its efforts on tasks whose successfulaccomplishment will make it possible to reconstruct thesocial and economic infrastructure of the southern part ofthe Republic  which was devastated by the civil war; toreintegrate the disrupted regional sectors of the nationaleconomy on a new basis; and to convert the distortedcentralized national economy that we inherited into amodern market economy.These tasks  difficult enough in their own right  are allthe more complex because of a chronic shortage of our ownfinancial resources. Thanks to the donor States  the UnitedNations specialized agencies and other international andregional organizations  Tajikistan continues to receivehumanitarian support. The overall volume of the assistancereceived  however  is insufficient  while the economicsituation inside the country continues to be verycomplicated.We note with satisfaction that  given thesecircumstances  authoritative international financialinstitutions have been understanding about our growingneeds. As a result  the Government of Tajikistan  supportedby the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund  ismaking deliberate efforts to intensify the reforms  create amarket economy in the country and integrate the nationaleconomy into the world trade and economic system.A solid basis for progressive and sustainabledevelopment is being created in the country step by step.That is why the Government of Tajikistan is particularlyinterested in the adoption by the General Assembly at thissession of decisions dealing with assistance to countrieswith transitional economies  taking into account the relevantprovisions of the Agenda for Development. We also hopethat the decisions of the most recent special session of theCommission for Social Development will be fullyimplemented.As the Assembly may know  the Commissionemphasized once again the necessity for United Nationsfinancial organizations to mobilize resources in support ofthe national efforts of the developing countries toimplement the Copenhagen Declaration on SocialDevelopment and the Programme of Action of the WorldSummit for Social Development. This important Declarationacquires special significance on the eve of the first UnitedNations Decade for the Eradication Poverty (1997-2006).The stabilization of Tajikistan’s economy is not onlythe key to satisfying the pressing social and economic needsof our people  but would without a doubt promote theprocess of national conciliation  social consolidation  andthe strong and healthy formation of democraticinstitutions in the country as a whole.As a post-socialist State at the very beginning of itsdemocratic rejuvenation  the Republic of Tajikistan valueshighly the international experience it has accumulatedwithin the United Nations. Such experience helpsGovernments to develop and strengthen new democracies.Drawing upon this rich international experience  myGovernment is purposefully taking importantconstitutional steps towards creating an open society.Firmly and consistently committed to the course ofdemocratic development pursued by the President of theRepublic of Tajikistan  Mr. Emomali Rakhmonov  theGovernment of my country promotes the involvement ofthe broad mass of the population in social  political andeconomic reform processes through such mechanisms asreferendums  national elections to representative bodies renovation of the judicial system and every possibleencouragement of openness.An important practical step towards the furtherdemocratization of society was taken with the adoption ofthe treaty on national reconciliation in Tajikistan  initiatedby the President and social organizations of the country.This treaty was signed by the leaders of the absolutemajority of political parties  public movements  nationalassociations and religious communities. We consider it tobe a universal  basic document of national reconciliationthat defines viewpoints for the formation of a Stateproviding for the equal and full participation of allpolitical and regional forces in national public life.The people of Tajikistan made a deliberate choice infavour of democratic reforms and they are not going togive them up voluntarily. However  the course is full ofobstacles  which my Government is resolved to overcomein the interests of achieving the main goal: the formationof a civil society.One of the main problems hampering our building ofa new society is an undeclared small war in the far south-east of Tajikistan and on the Tajik-Afghan border  whichhas been imposed on the Tajik people by the oppositionIslamic Revival Movement of Tajikistan. The intransigentarmed wing of the opposition is increasing tensions in thecountry by torpedoing the agreements reached at the inter-Tajik talks. By constantly and flagrantly violating theTajik-Afghan sector of the southern border of theCommonwealth of Independent States  it is inflicting pain24and suffering on the civil population and causing irreparabledamage to the unique wildlife of the Pamir region.The leadership of Tajikistan believes that the road topeace in the country lies through the continuation ofdialogue and the resolution of existing differences throughconstitutional legitimacy and only by political means. TheRepublic of Tajikistan sincerely appreciates the activehumanitarian mediation of the United Nations  which issearching for ways to resolve the conflict peacefully. MyGovernment greatly values the personal contribution madeby the Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  hisSpecial Representative  Mr. Gerd Merrem  and the UnitedNations Mission of Observers in Tajikistan to the settlementof the conflict.We greatly appreciate the significant contributionmade to the peace process by other internationalorganizations  as well as by the States attending the talks asobservers.In particular I would like to note the constructive roleplayed by the Russian Federation. It has given ussignificant and considerable assistance in protectingTajikistan’s border and ensuring security in general. We seethis assistance as a strategic measure aimed at preventingthe southern border of the Tajik part of the CIS from beingviolated. This task is being carried out by a group ofRussian border patrol troops in Tajikistan  comprised forthe most part of Tajik youths  and the collectivepeacekeeping forces with the participation of Uzbekistan Kazakstan and Kyrgyzstan.It is appropriate to recall that the leadership ofTajikistan and the States whose military contingents are partof the collective peacekeeping forces of the CIS haverepeatedly asked that these forces be granted the status ofUnited Nations peacekeeping operation. I do not think thisrequest is any less urgent today.We are well aware of the fact that the onlyprerequisite for effective dialogue is the moral willingnessof the opposing sides to reach a possible compromise. TheGovernment of Tajikistan has repeatedly demonstrated itsgood will by trying to meet the other side half-way and tobreathe new life into the negotiating process whenevernecessary. We will not tire of walking this  the only road topeace. At the same time  we consider the demands made bythe opposition for an equal division of power and particularly  the dismantling of existing State bodies as acondition for national reconciliation to be unrealistic anddesigned deliberately to lead to deadlock.The Government of Tajikistan is fully determinedlogically to finish what it has started and to find amutually acceptable formula for peace in the country.And if the opposition takes a similarly constructive stanceand strictly adheres to the Tehran ceasefire agreement then there is hope that the Ashgabat agreements will leadto real political results and bring the long-awaited peaceto Tajik soil. A striking illustration of this is theagreement reached on 16 September this year between theGovernment Commission and the opposition’s fieldcommanders that brought peace  fragile though it may be to this long-suffering land.The efforts of my Government to achieve peacewould be even more fruitful were it not for the remainingtensions in neighbouring Afghanistan  where the situationis a humanitarian tragedy of a truly global scale. Wewould welcome efforts by United Nations Member Statesto find new ways to settle the conflict in Afghanistan. Itis not only our geographical neighbour but also a countrylinked to Tajikistan by centuries-old historical andspiritual ties. While expressing grave concern at the latestdevelopments in neighbouring Afghanistan  we supportthe steps taken by the Security Council and the GeneralAssembly aimed at promoting a peaceful resolution of theAfghan conflict.The Republic of Tajikistan  for its part  is ready tojoin forces with other members of the internationalcommunity and contribute to this constructive process which may have a positive influence and help stabilizethe situation along the Tajik-Afghan border.From this high rostrum  I cannot but express mygratitude to the Office of the United Nations HighCommissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for its constructiveand fruitful participation in solving a humanitarianproblem: that of our refugees who have found themselvesin Afghanistan as a result of the civil war. The three-yearUNHCR operation in Tajikistan has ended with success.During this comparatively short period of time  withUNHCR assistance in finding a comprehensive solutionto this issue  most Tajik refugees have returned to theirhomeland. With the support of UNHCR  the Governmentof Tajikistan renovated about 18 000 houses for thereturned refugees. Programmes are being implemented  incooperation with the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme  to encourage the development of smallenterprises  promoting social and economic conditions thatcan help repatriates gradually to adapt.25The United Nations Children’s Fund and the WorldHealth Organization have made great and invaluablecontributions to health care and disease prevention forwomen and children in Tajikistan.At the same time  we cannot but be concerned for theseveral thousand Tajik refugees still in Afghanistan. Theirreturn to the homeland is being prevented by the armedopposition  which is linking their return to the resolution ofpolitical issues not directly related to this purelyhumanitarian act. We hope that  with the internationalcommunity’s assistance and the support of the Statesconcerned  a rapid and definitive solution can be found tothis major problem.In this regard  I wish to express our support for thedecisions of the Conference on Refugees  Returnees Displaced Persons and Related Migratory Movements in theCommonwealth of Independent States and RelevantNeighbouring States held in Geneva in late May this year.It is very important that the decisions taken at this sessionof the General Assembly support the programme of actionadopted at the Geneva conference.We are also concerned at the fact that military trainingbases of fighters belonging to the armed Tajik oppositioncontinue to operate  without hindrance  on the territory ofthe Islamic State of Afghanistan  itself a country that hasbeen plagued by civil war for almost two decades.This is where provocative cross-border sorties arecarefully planned and new victims of terror and violence including among the civilian population  are determined.Nor is it merely armed fighters that cross the Tajik-Afghanborder. Beyond Pyandzh  drug manufacturing is out ofcontrol and drug trafficking and the sales of drugs to othercountries  even to other continents  are consistently on therise.Criminal elements and groups from certain regions inAfghanistan illegally circulate arms  thus underminingTajikistan’s State security. It is well known that terroristsof every stripe have always fed off the drug trade andillegal arms sales. We  like other States  are particularlyalarmed at the close relationship between some terroristorganizations and the illegal drug trade.Drug addiction has long been one of the most terriblesocial scourges on Earth. In Tajikistan  which has becomeone of the world’s “hot spots” in terms of the distributionof drugs coming from outside the country  we understandonly too well the danger posed by drug abuse and illegaltrafficking to people’s lives  health  dignity and economicprosperity  as well as to the political stability of a State.The consequences of these criminal acts can be feltnot just in Tajikistan or the CIS  but far beyond theCommonwealth borders. All this poses a real threat topeace and stability throughout the Central and SouthAsian region  including Afghanistan.The Government of Tajikistan expresses its graveconcern at terrorist activity around the world. We need aunited front to curb the destructive wave of terror anddrastically intensify the common struggle to preventterrorism from emerging in any form. It is particularlynecessary to create a reliable barrier against terrorists’attempts to gain access to weapons of mass destruction.While unconditionally condemning all manifestationsof terrorism  the Government of Tajikistan feels that thetime has come to turn anti-terrorist cooperation under theauspices of the United Nations to practical action. In thisregard  we must make full use of the resources ofregional organizations.During the half a century of its existence  the UnitedNations has proved its viability; at the same time however  it has reached the threshold of certainindispensable changes in its structure and activities. Wefeel that  in today’s unstable and transitional internationalconditions  the role of the United Nations should steadilygrow.In our opinion  it is important to approach reform ina pragmatic way  concentrate on those issues that are ripefor resolution and maintain a reasonable balance betweeninnovation and those mechanisms that have proved theirefficiency. The most important thing is to enhancecoordination within the framework of the United Nations;to focus efforts on such priorities as peacemaking humanitarian crises  human rights  sustainabledevelopment and support to States with transitionaleconomies; and to monitor strictly the use of limitedavailable resources.The Government of Tajikistan feels that the integralelement in comprehensive United Nations reform is thequestion of the further enhancement of the role of theSecurity Council as the most important instrument formaintaining and strengthening international peace andsecurity. It is also our opinion that the expansion andrenewal of the Council must be carried out in keeping26with Charter criteria for Council membership and thecurrent status of its permanent members.We think that the Security Council would be mademore representative by adding not only some candidatesfrom among the industrial Powers  such as Germany andJapan  but also some representatives from Asian  Africanand Latin American countries. In this connection  theproposal made by the delegation of Italy is of great interest.In the autumn of 1995  when leaving United NationsHeadquarters in New York  the leaders of the communityof States once again affirmed the determination of theirGovernments to fight for the realization of our commonideals of peace and development  justice and sovereignequality and respect for human rights and basic freedoms including the right to development. At that time  weadopted a historic Declaration as a commitment to thepresent and future generations of the Earth to exert ourjoint efforts to prevent a resurgence of both cold and hotwars and large-scale and small-scale conflicts in ourglobal world.This is why we all have a great deal of creativework ahead of us — for the sake of all mankind and forthe benefit of the future of our planet Earth."
"163",6839,"TKM",51,1996,"﻿Allow me  first ofall  to congratulate Mr. Razali Ismail  as a representative ofa State with which Turkmenistan has exceptionally warmrelations  on the occasion of his election to this high post.I should like also to express confidence that his vastdiplomatic experience in close association with the UnitedNations will enable him to effectively guide the work of thecurrent session  which is called upon to accomplish anumber of historic objectives.The President's opening statement reaffirms that ourexpectations will come true. Here  I should like to expressour appreciation to Mr. Freitas do Amaral for his workduring the preceding session of the General Assembly which has become an integral part of Turkmenistan’shistory by dint of its unanimous adoption of the resolutionon the permanent neutrality of my country. Speaking fromthis rostrum on the eve of the adoption of that resolution His Excellency Saparmurad Niyazov  President ofTurkmenistan  emphasized that Turkmenistan would take allthe necessary steps to reaffirm its complete adherence tothe principles of the United Nations by making aconstructive contribution to the stabilization of thesituation in our strife-torn region  by peace-building andby serving the interests of cooperation within our regionand at the inter-regional level. During the past year Turkmenistan has taken steps to achieve this goal byplaying host to three rounds of talks between Tajikfactions in Ashgabat  by providing assistance to theMission of the Secretary-General’s special envoy forAfghanistan  and by hosting a number of majorinternational forums.Having entered the world community of nations asan independent State on the eve of the twenty-firstcentury  Turkmenistan  like other countries  has founditself facing the need to accept the challenge of the timesso typical of the turn of centuries. That is why we havefocused our efforts on the international arena  striving tobecome part of the worldwide process with its new trendstowards unity based on national statehood andsovereignty. A policy of constructive neutrality hasbecome our response to the challenge of the epoch.Turkmenistan is an Asian country whose destiny hasbeen to become one of the actors involved in the all-European process. We view this factor as a unique chanceto cooperate with the Europeans within the framework ofthe Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe(OSCE)  the European Union and other organizations  andto promote better understanding and the improvement ofNorth-South cooperation.Today the international community confrontsproblems requiring new approaches and innovativedecisions  profound analysis and forecasting. In thisrespect  we would like to propose that  under the auspicesof the United Nations  an international centre for politicalstudies be established in Turkmenistan that would carryout studies on the political and economic situation in ourregion. The work of the centre should correspond to thenew geopolitical realities  and the centre should have thetask of elaborating specific strategic recommendations inthe interests of global peace and security. It is no secretthat analysing a situation from a distance often leads toincorrect conclusions and projections.Confrontation between blocs has become a thing ofthe past. Today geo-economic regions have emerged asthe main actors in the political arena. Classifying Statesaccording to their size and might  which infringes on theinterests of small and medium-size States  has become23obsolete. Within the existing system of internationalrelations  all States should be able to structure themselveswithin the framework of universally accepted rules  but theyshould do so according to their own tenets and principles.It is in this context that we support the initiatives aimed atintroducing appropriate changes in the functioning of theUnited Nations  its bodies and sister organizations.The United Nations Charter stipulates that the SecurityCouncil bears primary responsibility for the maintenance ofinternational peace and security. We share the view thattoday the notion of security has undergone a radicaltransformation and includes an entire set of equallyimportant political  economic  environmental  social military and other components. Proceeding from thisassumption  we endorse the proposal that membership ofthis main body of the United Nations should be enlarged within reasonable limits  so that it may ensure that thisinternational process is manageable and controllable. Ofequal importance is the question of balanced and adequaterepresentation in the Security Council of States from boththe North and the South.Today’s Turkmenistan is a country with a transitionaleconomy undergoing profound social and political changes.In this respect  we hope that “An Agenda for Development”will be finalized during the current session  which will helpto establish a system of priorities and assistance to Statespursuing such national development programmes. It ishardly possible to overestimate the role of the UnitedNations  because it is precisely this mechanism that shouldensure the utmost objectivity and tolerance towards suchprocesses. Newly independent States did not emerge out ofa vacuum. Each one possesses its own specific features unique national and geographic characteristics  historicalties and psychological patterns. Each one has the right tochoose its own model of development and State system.Proceeding from this assumption  we support the viewthat diversity is integral to the world. However  though allStates are subject to international law  the aspirations of allfor development and prosperity cannot be programmedaccording to a single standard or world view. The mainchallenge of the twenty-first century is to ensure that allMembers of the United Nations can look at one anotherfrom the point of view of unity in diversity. We aretherefore grateful to the United Nations and to Statespossessing global political and economic potential for theirsupport and understanding.Turkmenistan possesses colossal natural resources. Ithas one of the richest deposits of hydrocarbons in theworld — I refer to the Caspian basin as well as to otherareas of my country. One of the major tasks facing us isthe establishment of a pipeline infrastructure that  inconjunction with the existing system  will ensure supplyof our gas to Europe and Asia. We are glad thatTurkmenistan’s interests as an exporter coincide with theinterests of European and Asian consumers. We are happythat neighbouring countries — Iran  Afghanistan  Russia Turkey  Pakistan  Uzbekistan and Kazakstan — do nothave any differences with respect to this issue.In this context I would like to touch on severalissues relating to the Caspian Sea. Turkmenistan  like alllittoral States  is concerned about its future and theprospects for its resources. We believe that there is noplace for unilateral decisions or dictates on this issue.What is required is the establishment of a system of fulltrust and interaction among the Caspian Sea States for thesake of the common interests and prosperity of eachindividual State. The forthcoming Conference of ForeignMinisters of the Caspian States to be held in Ashgabatwill serve as the forum for discussion of all thoseproblems and will prepare a platform for a Caspiansummit meeting.Turkmenistan is opposed to any military activity inthe Caspian Sea. It wishes to ensure a regime of freenavigation with respect to the national borders of everylittoral State. The wealth of the Caspian Sea  its uniquebiological and mineral structure and fragile ecologicalsystem call for a comprehensive and balanced approach free from short-term profit or political advantage. We donot doubt that all Caspian Sea States will be able to findthe best alternative on the basis of common sense andrespect for the interests of each country involved in thename of the common goal of peace and security.There is one area of cooperation with the UnitedNations in which Turkmenistan has a special interest: thestruggle against drug distribution and trafficking.Turkmenistan is waging a relentless fight against this eviland has established a State coordination commission. Atthe beginning of this year Turkmenistan joined the 1961Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs  the 1971Convention on Psychotropic Substances and the 1988United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic inNarcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances.Turkmenistan attaches great importance to its cooperationwith the United Nations International Drug ControlProgramme  and has signed a bilateral agreement with it.In May 1996 Turkmenistan  together with other countriesof Central Asia  and in cooperation with the United24Nations International Drug Control Programme  signed amemorandum on regional cooperation concerning control ofillegal production  trafficking and abuse of narcotic drugs.We need to make extraordinary efforts in order to controlthe situation  roll back the spiral of evil and reverse thesituation whereby the problem of drugs grows in proportionto the efforts made to combat it.Turkmenistan is actively cooperating with theOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe(OSCE) and the United Nations in developing democraticprocesses so as to bring up new generations free from theold psychological stereotypes and doubtful ideologicalvalues. Democracy  human rights  people’s rights toproperty and legal protection are all universal notions.However  it is not enough simply to understand theirrelevance; it is necessary to implement them in real lifeonce and for all. What we need is patience and time toallow such understanding to be translated into practicalreality. That is why Turkmenistan has created an institutefor democracy  human rights and statehood development which is called upon to develop its own model of ademocratic society  relying on the best European and Asianexperiences and drawing on the knowledge of internationalexperts. One does not have to be a specialist in order tounderstand that  no matter how perfect a model proposedfrom outside may seem  it might not be effective whenapplied to a traditional Oriental society such as exists inTurkmenistan  a country that has inherited values fromancient civilizations and the culture of Islam. There is alsoa specific mentality among its people  who have forcenturies fought for their survival and have eventuallyacquired the chance to be independent and have their ownnational identity.The agenda of the current session includes an itemdealing with the development of cooperation between theUnited Nations and its bodies and the EconomicCooperation Organization (ECO). During the last summit ofthat organization  which was held in May 1996 in thecapital of Turkmenistan  my country assumed thepresidency for the next two-year period  and it intends toexert every effort necessary to implement the large-scaleprogrammes of this organization  which now comprises 10countries.The ECO is a purely economic organization with nopolitical strings attached. It members share a common viewon this matter. Similarly  we believe that only theacceleration of economic development and the improvementof cooperation among States can bring well-being andprosperity to the peoples of the region. However  a numberof political preconditions are indispensable for developingeconomic interaction so that it can be effective andfruitful. I believe that a climate of political trust is thefirst requirement. If such a climate becomes a constantfactor in our relations  it will contribute to theadvancement of new  bold initiatives and specific projects.To put it plainly  we must profess a philosophy of mutualunderstanding and trust. It is only under such conditionsthat our projects can be successfully implemented. Thatis especially important because conflict situations persistin the ECO region  in Tajikistan and Afghanistan.Turkmenistan firmly believes that these two ancient andwise peoples are capable of overcoming the syndrome oflingering mistrust and difference. We fully support theinitiative of the United Nations and the efforts ofneighbouring countries aimed at a peaceful settlement.As for Afghanistan  we consider it important that theconflict there has moved from being in a category offorgotten conflicts to the centre of international efforts.By conducting constant consultations with the leaders ofneighbouring countries and the Secretary-General  thePresident of Turkmenistan  Saparmurat Niyazov  hasexpressed Turkmenistan’s readiness to take an active partin the search for an Afghan settlement. The fate of manyglobal economic projects hinges on peace in Afghanistan in particular the supply of energy resources to activelydeveloping energy markets in Asia.Next month Turkmenistan will celebrate the fifthanniversary of its independence. Today we can discernmore clearly the perspectives and understand better inwhat areas we should develop cooperation with foreignpartners. We can clearly see and evaluate the situation athome  in the region and the rest of the world.Accumulated experience enables us to say thatTurkmenistan has found its place in the internationalcommunity  both politically and economically. Byconsistently and progressively25moving towards the democratization of our society and theestablishment of market mechanisms in the economy  ourState is becoming integrated into the worldwide process. Byclosely interacting with foreign partners and pursuing avigorous foreign policy  we are confident that these taskswill be implemented promptly and efficiently."
"164",6907,"TTO",51,1996,"﻿It is a greathonour for me to extend to Mr. Razali Ismail our warmestcongratulations  on behalf of the delegation of Trinidad andTobago  on his election as President of this session of theGeneral Assembly.As the United Nations begins the second half-centuryof its existence  and as the international community seeksto renew and reshape the Organization to deal with thechallenges of the approaching millennium  the Trinidad andTobago delegation is particularly pleased to see thestewardship of the General Assembly in the hands of aleader and a friend of Mr. Razali’s calibre.My delegation would also like to express its deepappreciation to his predecessor  His Excellency Mr. DiogoFreitas do Amaral of Portugal  for the able manner in whichhe presided over the historic fiftieth session of theGeneral Assembly.Today more than ever  we live in a global age  anage of immeasurable possibilities and opportunitiesengendered by advances in technology  the informationrevolution and globalization; but it is also an age full ofperil  one characterized by complex and myriadchallenges  many of which we have yet to understandfully or come to terms with.In this age of globalization and fragmentation traditional national and international structures arebecoming increasingly inadequate to deal with currentrealities. Nation States are also more frequentlyconfronting the need to find acceptable means by whichto yield elements of their sovereignty through regionaland multilateral action  in order to deal effectively withglobal forces that are invariably transnational in nature.In this sea of change in international relations  thewhole concept of international security has increasinglymoved away from the bipolar view  concerned largelywith military security  to one which assigns a central roleto sustainable development and the welfare of theindividual. The major actors in the international arena areno longer solely nation States  but also economic agentswith a global reach and non-governmental organizationswith a growing global influence.Yet these powerful forces that are inexorably pullingus together are also simultaneously tearing us apart engendering fragmentation  reactivating age-old conflicts and threatening more than ever to marginalize and leavebehind large segments of humanity in the march toprogress. Among some of the more powerful andindustrialized countries  the fears of active integration andengagement are leading to temptations to look inward andto become more isolationist and more protectionist. Inaddition  the problems of persistent poverty  increasingunemployment  debilitating debt  declining levels ofofficial development assistance  environmentaldegradation  drug abuse and drug trafficking  crime terrorism and social disintegration have combined topresent a formidable array of challenges  which  if leftunaddressed  threaten to overwhelm us and furthermarginalize the vulnerable and disadvantaged among us.In this new global environment  we are at a criticalcrossroads  and in many ways the decisions that confrontus in the international community on the eve of the20twenty-first century are no less important than those thatconfronted us at the end of the war to end all wars.In this evolving global society  the choices are clear.Will we allow the world to drift towards the dangerousanarchy of spheres of influence and uncheckedconfrontation? Or will we commit ourselves to greatercooperation inherent in the call to global neighbourhoodaction? Will we allow ethnic conflicts and “ethniccleansing” to continue? Or will we resolutely resist theprimitive impulses by devising mechanisms to avoidrepetitions of these phenomena  wherever they occur?Will we grasp the new opportunity for globalprosperity  or will we allow the common global enemies tooverwhelm us? Will we help to alleviate the crisis inmultilateralism and give to the world of the twenty-firstcentury a reformed United Nations  true to the ideals of thefounding fathers  or will we increasingly move in thedirection of unilateralism  seeking to use the United Nationsfor narrow self-interest? Finally  will we give to the worlda new global order  true to the letter and spirit of thefiftieth anniversary Declaration  and based on thesustainable development agenda of the recent globalconferences  or will we build a world of two societies  onegetting progressively richer and the other progressivelypoorer?We must not be afraid of challenges. Trinidad andTobago  as a small developing island State  with all theconcomitant vulnerability and fragility  has embarked on anaggressive  outward-oriented strategy of development. Thisstrategy has been informed by the need to optimize ourability to participate in a global economy that is becomingincreasingly knowledge-based  fiercely competitive andvolatile. Our development strategy has as its basic objectivethe attainment of broad-based economic growth with socialequity. It assigns a special emphasis to trade  investment tourism  agriculture  services and the environment  and itseeks  through a political process of inclusiveness andempowerment  to mobilize all of our human resources inthe task of building a sustainable democracy.In November 1995  the new Government of Trinidadand Tobago  which I have the honour to lead  assumedoffice through the medium of the ballot box. The peacefuland democratic transfer of power that took place at thattime was further ample testimony to the political maturityof our peoples  and the political stability that we inTrinidad and Tobago and the Caribbean have been fortunateto enjoy.In any democracy  however  one must be eternallyvigilant  constantly striving to enhance the democratictradition and strengthen the democratic process. It is inthis context that I have sought to establish a Governmentof National Unity  committed to partnership-building at alllevels. Special emphasis has been placed on thedevolution of power from central to local governmentauthorities  so as to facilitate greater participation in thedemocratic process. A National Multipartite Commission comprising representatives of labour  business Government  non-governmental organizations and theInter-Religious Organization  has been established andentrusted with the task of formulating a comprehensiveplan of action to take us into the twenty-first century. Theaim of these and other measures is to build a trulyparticipatory society  empowering all of our peoples.In the social arena  we have sought to create a viablesocial pact among business  labour and Government  builton consultation  partnership and consensus  so as toprovide stability  trust and transparency in industrialrelations. We have also sought  through our socialprogrammes  to place special emphasis on thedisadvantaged and dispossessed  with a view to providingthem with the necessary support  training and skills foreffective participation in our society. In this regard  aChange Management Unit for Poverty Eradication andEquity Building has been established under the authorityof a senior Cabinet Minister. The unit is entrusted withthe responsibility of formulating an integrated  multi-sectoral and sustained approach to poverty eradication and ensuring its implementation in all facets of theGovernment’s economic and social policies. As acomplement to this Unit  the Government of Trinidad andTobago will  on 24 October 1996 — United NationsDay — set up a National Social Development Council tomobilize national action to deal with the homeless and thepoor. This innovative approach to poverty eradication isbeing implemented in close cooperation with the UnitedNations Development Programme  which has providedtimely support in this  the International Year for theEradication of Poverty. In keeping with the spirit ofBeijing and the Platform for Action of the BeijingConference  a vigorous policy and legislative agenda isbeing formulated and implemented through a consultativeprocess  the objective being to optimize the role ofwomen as equal partners in the development process.With regard to the environment  a comprehensivelegislative and policy framework has been put in place torespond to the demands of sustainable development. Thisnew environmental regime will serve to ensure a21“greening” of the Government’s own operations  whilesimultaneously engaging the public and industry in apartnership for responsible management  protection andconservation of the environment.Trinidad and Tobago’s economic programme places apremium on trade  with the private sector as the engine ofgrowth in the economy. Some of the essential elements ofthe strategy are the attraction of private investment flows creation of increased market access  and the implementationof an appropriate industrial policy. This is being achievedthrough the pursuit of a sound and stable macroeconomicpolicy  supported by a prudent and disciplined fiscal andmonetary stance  and the delivery of an investor-friendlyinstitutional legal framework.We in Trinidad and Tobago are under no illusions. Allof our national efforts will be in vain if we do not have asupportive regional and international environment  as wellas access to a fair  open and non-discriminatoryinternational trading regime. Regional integration hasalways been a fundamental component of the developmentstrategy of Trinidad and Tobago. Accordingly  our Republichas built strategic alliances through the CaribbeanCommunity  the Rio Group and  more recently  theAssociation of Caribbean States  comprising countries ofthe wider Caribbean. We continue to be engaged activelyin efforts to deepen and broaden the integration processwithin the region through initiatives that we hope willculminate in formal relationships with the Central AmericanCommon Market  the Andean Pact and the Southern ConeCommon Market (MERCOSUR). Our vision for the futureis a single free-trade area in the western hemisphere.For small States like Trinidad and Tobago  greaterregional integration and cooperation are imperative if weare to minimize the negative and pervasive effects ofglobalization  while simultaneously laying the foundationsfor our increased capacity to navigate the turbulent watersof the expanding global economy.Regionalism is a critical priority  but in today’s worldit must be conceived as a natural and essential complementto wider international cooperation. The common evils of thetwenty-first century will require a common approach  acommon commitment. I can think of no other organizationmore uniquely placed or more legitimate than the UnitedNations to foster the global conscience  to fashion thenecessary understanding  to build the mutual partnerships and to organize the global cooperative effort.In the field of sustainable development  thecontinuum of global conferences  from Rio to Istanbul have laid down a global agenda  a development blueprintfor the twenty-first century. Yet as discussions on theAgenda for Development have shown  there is a crisis ofcommitment  particularly on the part of the developedcountries  to provide the required resources. “Donorfatigue” and declining levels of official developmentassistance threaten to render meaningless the globalunderstanding  consensus and Programmes of Actionforged in respect of the major issues and problems of ourtimes.This negative mood imperils all of us  for itthreatens to subject some one fifth of the world’spopulation  who live in poverty  to a life of perpetualdespair. But more than that  it ignores the fact that thegap between the haves and the have-nots continues togrow alongside the growth in world trade. It forgets themessage inherent in the common problems of our time:that whether we like it or not  our progress  andincreasingly our security  is tied to that of our neighbours no matter how poor or how distant they may be. Finally it ignores the generally acknowledged fact that preventiveaction to deal with the root causes of conflict is lesscostly and more effective than corrective action.Trinidad and Tobago also attaches the highestpriority to the fight against drug abuse and drugtrafficking. We have intensified our coordination activitiesat the national level  and have systematically put in placecooperative mechanisms with other Caribbean and LatinAmerican countries  as well as with other States whoseinvolvement is critical to the success of national andregional efforts. We believe that the violence  thecorruption and the human despair which this menacewreaks on societies in all corners of the globe  shouldleave no doubt as to the imperative need for the UnitedNations to accord priority attention to this question.Trinidad and Tobago is therefore fully supportive of thecall for the convening in 1997 of an internationalconference on this subject. My delegation wishes tocommend in particular the United Nations InternationalDrug Control Programme for its important contribution tothe multi-dimensional campaign against drug abuse andillicit drug trafficking being waged within our Republicand in the wider Caribbean and Latin American region.We urge the Drug Control Programme to continue topursue a comprehensive and balanced approach to thisworldwide campaign  endeavouring to address equitablythe problems of demand  production and trafficking.22In the field of international law  we have over the pastdecades seen a number of new agreements in virtually allbranches of human activity. Trinidad and Tobago isencouraged by the progress made during the fiftieth sessionof the General Assembly towards the establishment of aninternational criminal court. We look forward to a positiverecommendation for the completion of work during thefifty-first session of the General Assembly in order torealize the goal of a diplomatic conference in 1998 to adoptthe statute and establish the court. We in the internationalcommunity have the responsibility to create this globalinstitution with the requisite global jurisdiction  and toequip it with the necessary authority to make it an effective impartial body  with the broadest possible participation ofStates from all geographical regions. Meanwhile  Trinidadand Tobago fully supports the activities of the InternationalTribunals for the territories of the former Yugoslavia andof Rwanda.In the field of nuclear disarmament  the internationalcommunity last year indefinitely extended the Treaty on theNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and  earlier thismonth  the General Assembly adopted the ComprehensiveNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. These two developments haveserved to promote non-proliferation and nucleardisarmament. The international community must now however  focus its attention on the emerging consensus thatall nuclear explosions must be banned.A related environmental concern to which Trinidadand Tobago  the Caribbean and the Alliance of Small IslandNations attach the greatest importance is that of thecontinued shipments of irradiated nuclear fuel  plutoniumand high-level radioactive wastes. At last year’s ReviewConference on the Non-Proliferation Treaty  Trinidad andTobago and the Alliance of Small Island Nations was able after long and intensive negotiations  to obtain agreementon specific language registering the concerns of smallisland developing States and other coastal States on thisissue.The considerations which led us to pursue thatinitiative then are still relevant now. These shipmentscontinue to take place despite the potentially catastrophiceffects on small island developing States  whose fragile andvulnerable economies are overwhelmingly dependent ontheir marine and coastal resources  and who possess neitherthe resources nor the capability to deal with possibleaccidents of this nature. Trinidad and Tobago wouldtherefore like to reiterate the priority concern we attach tothis issue  and to urge the shipment countries to respect thewishes of small island developing States and other en-routeStates  which have called for an end to these shipmentsthrough their archipelagic and territorial waters  as well astheir exclusive economic zones.The notions of shared responsibilities and collectiveaction are the raison d’être of the United Nations system.As we prepare to face the new challenges of the twenty-first century  these notions assume a critical relevance.Trinidad and Tobago is convinced that the United Nationshas the capacity to reconcile these opposing forces ofglobalization and fragmentation in the interests of us all.The United Nations also has the strength and legitimacyto transform the fears and perils of the new age into aconstructive global partnership of cooperation andsolidarity. Trinidad and Tobago pledges to work withothers to harness this potential and to confront thechallenges which face the Organization and theinternational community as we move towards the newmillennium."
"165",6954,"TUN",51,1996,"﻿Allow me first of all to convey to Mr. Razali Ismail mysincere and heartfelt congratulations on the occasion of hiselection to the presidency of the fifty-first session of theGeneral Assembly. I am convinced that thanks to his wiseand able leadership and his extensive experience in the fieldof international relations  the proceedings of our sessionwill be successful.Malaysia’s presidency of the General Assembly isclear testimony to the respect that Mr. Razali’s countryenjoys within the international community  whichappreciates the great and efficient role played by Malaysiaat the regional and international levels in order tostrengthen and consolidate relations among nations on thebasis of peace  justice and cooperation. I take thisopportunity to pay tribute to the excellent relations offriendship and fruitful cooperation that exist between ourtwo countries.I should like also to convey my sincere thanks toMr. Razali’s predecessor  Mr. Freitas do Amaral  for hisvaluable efforts during his presidency of the fiftieth sessionof the General Assembly. I wish to mention in particularhis contribution to helping advance the process of reform ofthe United Nations  in order to make it more efficient in thelight of the changes the world is witnessing.I should like also to pay tribute to Mr. BoutrosBoutros-Ghali and to convey to him our appreciation andsupport for his continued selfless dedication as head of theSecretariat of the United Nations. My delegation alsoappreciates his courageous initiatives  especially his SpecialInitiative for Africa  as well as his constructive proposalswithin the Agenda for Peace and the Agenda forDevelopment. Tunisia  which supports the renewal ofMr. Boutros-Ghali’s mandate  stresses the importance ofcontinuing the reform process undertaken in recent years.With the end of the cold war  the internationalcommunity has entered a new era of internationalrelations that aims to reject the use of force and violenceas a means of settling conflicts  and to put an end to thearms race. This trend favours the logic of wisdom andmoderation by resorting to peaceful means and preventivediplomacy  which offer possibilities for dialogue concertation and negotiation to resolve conflicts  disputesand crises  however complex they may be.We welcome this emerging trend in internationalrelations  which is a consecration of the principles andpurposes of the United Nations as enunciated in itsCharter. This trend must be strengthened and consolidatedin order to eliminate sources of tension and defuseconflicts before they break out.The international community welcomed withenthusiasm the start of the peace process in the MiddleEast. This raised hopes of seeing the parties arrive at atrue  comprehensive  just and honourable peace  thusputting an end to a cruel conflict that has lasted foralmost half a century  during which time the peoples ofthe region have experienced the horrors of war destruction  exodus and occupation. This peace settlementshould be based on international law and United Nationsresolutions  in particular Security Council resolutions 242(1967)  338 (1973) and 425 (1978)  and on the principleof the exchange of land for peace.The Madrid Conference and the ensuing intensivenegotiations  which resulted in the Oslo  Washington andCairo agreements  led us to believe that the new peaceprocess was finally on the right track. However  theagenda of the new Israeli Government has dashed thehopes of the peoples of the region. This agenda hasindeed blocked the peace process on all tracks. Anincrease in Israeli pressures and provocations  which aimultimately at imposing the policy of the fait accompli  hashindered the Palestinian people’s progress towardsachieving their legitimate right to self-determination andto create their own independent State.The bloody events triggered by the opening of atunnel under the Holy Mosque of Al-Aqsa emphasize theneed for decisive international action to bring the IsraeliGovernment to abide by the agreements concluded withthe Palestinian Authority and to comply with internationallaw regarding the settlement of the question of Palestine.14Tunisia is concerned by the stagnation of the peaceprocess and its negative effects on building the future of theregion on the basis of peace  security  stability andcooperation among its peoples. Tunisia considers that Israelmust re-evaluate its present policy and commit itself torespecting the principles of the peace process and toimplementing the agreements already signed.We also call upon the international community particularly the sponsors of the peace process  to spare noeffort in facilitating the resumption of the peacenegotiations as soon as possible in order to avoid any riskof failure  which could affect the credibility of this processand lead to the return of confrontation and the escalation ofviolence  extremism and terrorism. We believe thatconfidence-building  good faith and a sincere commitmentto a peaceful solution are necessary to advance this process.The commitment of all parties to achieving a just comprehensive and lasting peace is essential to ensuring thesecurity and stability of the States of the region as well asthe coexistence of their peoples.As stated by President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali onmany occasions  Tunisia is committed to following thesame approach it has taken since the beginning of the peaceprocess  by establishing a close link between each steptowards normalization and the progress achieved by thenegotiations on all tracks.The establishment of peace in the Middle East dependson the maintenance of security and stability in the Gulfregion. Tunisia  which is deeply concerned by recentdevelopments in that region  calls upon all parties to showrestraint  avoid any escalation and remain committed tointernational legality and to the implementation of allUnited Nations resolutions. Tunisia also reiterates itscommitment to respect the sovereignty of all States in theregion as well as their territorial integrity and inviolability.We also call for an end to the suffering that the Iraqipeople have been experiencing for several years  and wehope that recent developments in the region will notaggravate this situation.Tunisia believes that the time has come to lift theembargo imposed on the Libyan people in view of thenumerous positive initiatives taken by Libya  the League ofArab States and the Organization of African Unity  all ofwhich aim at reaching a peaceful and just solution and atputting an end to the suffering of the brotherly Libyanpeople within the framework of international legality.Devoted to peace and a staunch supporter of justcauses  Tunisia reiterates its solidarity with the UnitedArab Emirates and its full support for that country’sendeavour to recover through peaceful means  whichinclude appealing to the International Court of Justice  theislands of Great Tunb  Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa.Turning to the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina Tunisia expresses its satisfaction at the return of peace tothis country  and hopes that the recent elections will markthe beginning of a new era in which concord understanding and common action will prevail  thusallowing the establishment of the foundations of theBosnian State.We note that today the international community isgiving priority to disarmament as the best means ofensuring and consolidating international security.Considerable progress has been made in this regard especially in the area of controlling the proliferation ofweapons of mass destruction  in particular chemical andnuclear weapons.Tunisia welcomes the adoption by the GeneralAssembly of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treatyand its opening for signature. We hope that all MemberStates will adhere to this Treaty  in order to ensure itsuniversal application. The Treaty’s conclusion  as well asthe anticipated strengthening of the Biological WeaponsConvention  due to be reviewed soon in order to provideit with a verification mechanism  will no doubtconsolidate the progress made thus far in the field ofdisarmament.While expressing our appreciation for the declarationof Africa as a Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone  we hope thatour continent will be relieved of all weapons of massdestruction. We also reiterate our call to free the MiddleEast from all nuclear weapons and weapons of massdestruction.While emphasizing the necessity of introducingefficient measures for ensuring a total ban of weapons ofmass destruction  we believe that it is also essential totackle the issue of conventional weapons  particularly thequestion of the accumulation and illegal trade in lightweapons. This problem is not only serious but is growingmore so every day  since these are the most commonlyused weapons in current conflicts and recent terroristoperations.15In addition to its contribution to disarmament efforts Tunisia has always supported United Nations peacekeepingefforts around the world. From the early 1960s on  it hastaken part in United Nations operations in many Africancountries  Cambodia  Bosnia and Herzegovina  Croatia andelsewhere.Convinced of the importance of these operations inmaintaining international peace and security  Tunisia calledon member States of the Organization of African Unity(OAU) to create special units within their armed forces forparticipation when necessary in peacekeeping operations onthe African continent.While welcoming the decision of the United Nationson establishing a system of standby forces to act tointervene rapidly and efficiently in peacekeeping operations Tunisia solemnly declares its readiness today to participatein that system  thus confirming our commitment to theOrganization and to its role in the maintenance of worldpeace and security.Intolerance  racism  organized crime  the illegal armsand drug trades  the illegal traffic in human beings terrorism and extremism in all its forms are all phenomenathat have taken on a transnational dimension. Theinternational community should ensure that appropriatesolutions are found by means of a global approach based onthe definition and implementation of internationalcooperation strategies in order to contain and eradicatethese scourges.On many occasions and before various internationaland regional forums  my country has called the internationalcommunity’s attention to the dangers of re-emergentterrorism and extremism  which threaten the stability andsecurity of States as well as the safety of individuals. Inthis vein  Tunisia called for the conduct of a comprehensiveand thorough re-evaluation of the attitudes of all parties tothese scourges through the establishment of internationalrules of conduct with the aim of fighting all illegalactivities  particularly those related to terrorism  in order tofind efficient and lasting remedies to these problems and toeliminate their deep-rooted causes.Tunisia notes with satisfaction the increasingawareness of the need for the international community tojoin efforts in order to fight terrorism. We hope that theUnited Nations will adopt mandatory measures that wouldaddress this phenomenon by criminalizing all terrorist acts.We also hope that all member States will revise and adapttheir relevant legislation to these measures.Tunisia’s steadfast efforts to consolidate thefoundations of the country’s political institutions and therule of law and to promote and protect human rights intheir global dimension flow from a civilized  irreversiblechoice made in accordance with universal values.Eager to ensure respect for human dignity and toencourage ongoing development efforts to secure thewell-being of all citizens  Tunisia has been able toreconcile  in a balanced manner  economic growth withthe preservation of political  economic and social rights the requisite foundations of democracy.Tunisia will continue to advance the causes ofhuman rights in the world and to support the UnitedNations Voluntary Fund for technical assistance in thefield of human rights  as well as the Programme ofAction for the United Nations Decade for Human RightsEducation.We are persuaded that the dissemination of theculture of human rights will come to fruition only withthe promotion of tolerance  which is an essential civilizedvalue upon which are based all religions and human-rightsideals.Tunisia placed particular emphasis on tolerance inthe reform of its education system  since it is convincedthat global change  the progress of civilization andculture  as well as economic and social growth  will befirmly established only when coming generations arewell-prepared and when the values of peace  democracyand goodness are complemented by a culture of tolerance.Economic globalization has opened new perspectivesfor international cooperation for development. But it hasalso had a negative impact on the economies of numerousdeveloping countries that have been swept up in itwithout adequately preparing their economic and socialstructures.In the new era  Tunisia has focused on setting up acomprehensive and multidimensional developmentstrategy designed to assist the disadvantaged in societyand based on a broadened concept of human rights.Tunisia’s policy in this regard was based on adevelopment approach aimed at providing equalopportunities to all levels of society and ensuring thewell-being of all its citizens.The human dimension for which Tunisia has optedin defining its development policies has led to a deeper16spirit of solidarity within the population towards theunderprivileged and vulnerable sectors and to granting themthe highest priority. In order to achieve these objectives President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali took the initiative ofestablishing an anti-poverty programme — the NationalSolidarity Fund — aimed at eradicating pockets of povertyand ensuring harmonious development for all social sectors.The debt burden in the third world is a very seriousproblem that cannot be overlooked  since it constitutes themain obstacle to their efforts to achieve a regulardevelopment pattern  free from any shortcomings or failure.While we welcome the Group of Seven’s economiccommuniqué on the issue of debt  we also stress the needto take appropriate measures to alleviate the debt burden ofmiddle-income countries.The World Bank and the International Monetary Fundand the World Trade Organization should implement thecommitments undertaken by the international community inthe framework of the major conferences held during thepast five years. To this end  they need to mobilize theresources required to fund the programmes adopted bythese conferences in the quest for sustainable development.We welcome the process of reform initiated by theUnited Nations with the aim of adjusting to the emerginginternational environment  improving its functions andassuming its responsibilities as the institution best able tomaintain peace and security  on the one hand  and to pursueand support efforts on behalf of the economic and socialdevelopment of the developing countries  on the other.To this end  it is equally important to continue theprocess of reform of the Organization with the aim ofrationalizing and strengthening its role as the central pillarof international cooperation for achieving objectives andimplementing programmes agreed upon by the internationalcommunity  on the basis of priorities set by Governmentsseeking to eradicate poverty and to support employment andhousing programmes  as well as those that provide basicservices in the education and health sectors and offerprotection to women  children and the sociallyunderprivileged.These objectives can be attained only through the useof jointly agreed criteria based on transparency anddemocracy in international relations  and by rejecting anypolicy that involves a double standard.In order to preserve the prestige and credibility of theUnited Nations  it is necessary to implement the resolutionsthe Organization adopts and to follow up on thecommitments entered into by States.We would also like to underline the extremeimportance we attach to the restructuring of the SecurityCouncil  so as to enable this eminent body to play its keyrole in the maintenance of international peace andsecurity  while taking into consideration the need for anequitable geographical representation based on new geo-political realities. I should like to recall in this respect thatTunisia supports granting Japan and Germany the statusof permanent members of the Security Council  owing tothe political and economic standing of both countries.In accordance with the consensus reached at thethirtieth Organization of African Unity summit meeting held in Tunis  we reaffirm Africa’s right to at least twopermanent seats on the Security Council that would rotateamong all African States.Tunisia supports any initiative that takes into accountthese principles  and it expresses its appreciation for theinitiatives and ideas presented by some States  inparticular friendly neighbouring Italy  in order to achievea comprehensive vision regarding reform of the SecurityCouncil.Finally  we believe that the success of ourOrganization depends on the determination of all MemberStates to act in conformity with the purposes andprinciples set out in the Charter  as well as on sincerepolitical will  in order to allow our Organization to fulfilthe aspirations and hopes of our peoples  who provide itthe indispensable support it needs to guarantee itscontinued vitality  its renewed capacity and its durability."
"166",7001,"TUR",51,1996,"I should like to congratulatewarmly Mr. Razali on his election to the high office ofPresident of the General Assembly. I am confident thatunder his wise and able guidance our deliberations will bemost successful. I should also like to thank His ExcellencyMr. Do Amaral for his most valuable contribution to thework of the previous session of the General Assembly.We have just left behind 50 years in the life of thisuniversal Organization  which was founded with the idealof serving and guiding humankind in its common quest tomake the world a better place to live. The commemorationlast year of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nationsmarked an important milestone in our journey. Yet we findthat our common pursuit of a new and more promisingorder of international relations is far from its goal. The newexpectations and hopes that the end of the cold-war erainstilled in us all have  unfortunately  been short-lived.Indeed  such dark forces as extreme ethnic nationalism aggression  hegemonistic tendencies  intolerance  racism xenophobia and terrorism have been unleashed to wreakhavoc on a global scale. At the same time  economic  socialand environmental problems  as well as risks in the militarysecurity realm  have assumed global proportions.No country can claim to be immune from any of theproblems we are facing today  which need commonsolutions. In fact  there is an emerging consensus that morethan ever  our common problems require global solutions which must be formulated in a spirit of solidarity andcooperation. This spirit can find concrete expression onlywithin this Organization  which continues to be the onlyglobal forum for collective cooperation and effectiveinternational action. Therefore  it is our duty to generationsto come to refashion this institution so as to furtherstrengthen it and equip it with the means to meet thechallenge of the new era that begins with the twenty-firstcentury.As we embark on the second half-century of ourOrganization  it is high time that the internationalcommunity reassess the ways and means by which it cangive a new impetus to the efforts aimed at building a betterand more secure future for all humankind. Substantial workto this end has already been carried out within the UnitedNations system. In particular  the series of majorconferences on basic issues of common concern laid thegroundwork for future action. The chain of theseconferences  which began with the 1990 World Summitfor Children and ended with the Conference on HumanSettlements in Istanbul this past June  has coveredvirtually every aspect of human interest. The declarationsand programmes of action they adopted will serve as ourroad map in our efforts to achieve their final objectives.It was a distinct privilege for Turkey to host  inIstanbul this year  the last major international conferenceof the century  Habitat II. That conference played aninstrumental role in creating a greater awareness thatadequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlementsin a rapidly urbanizing and globalizing world are thecommon challenges before us. The Istanbul Declarationand the Habitat Agenda will be our guiding instrumentsto meet these challenges. We attach great importance tothe follow-up of that successful conference.Although criticized at times for its limitations  theUnited Nations has nevertheless played a crucial role inthe search for global solutions to the problemsencountered in every field of human endeavour. Yet thechallenges that it will face in the twenty-first century willprobably be far greater and more formidable than everbefore  and the United Nations  therefore  has to promptlyadapt to changing times. For this reason  we support theongoing reform process within the United Nations. In thisrespect  streamlining  rationalizing  revitalizing andrestructuring the United Nations system and its work arethe widely accepted components needed to bring about amore effective  responsive  representative  democratic andaccountable world Organization. These modifications which are currently under intense consideration at variouslevels  will  to a large extent  determine the effectivenessof the United Nations in the years to come.Since January 1994  the Open-ended Working Groupon the Question of Equitable Representation on andIncrease in the Membership of the Security Council andother matters has been formulating a set of guidelines forthe ongoing reform process. The general issue before ushere is the enhancement of the representative character ofthe Security Council and the democratization of itsmethod of work. Strongly in favour of a comprehensivereform  Turkey last year formally introduced a proposalfor the enlargement of the Security Council. As therepresentative character of the Council has  despite minoradjustments  eroded steadily  we believe that a Council4General Assembly 15th plenary meetingFifty-first session 30 September 1996with at least 25 members would be more representative andthus more effective. We hold the view that the Councilshould be enlarged by 10 additional non-permanentmembers and that the proposed new additional seats shouldrotate among a predetermined list of about 30 to 40countries. These countries should be selected within thegeographical groups according to a set of objective criteriathat can be modified  of course  in time. The list wouldconsequently be flexible and updated after a certain periodof time to conform to arising new conditions.As regards to its working methods and procedures  theCouncil has already taken some important steps. There is however  a widespread belief that these steps fall short ofthe legitimate expectations of the great majority of theMember States. Hence  more work needs to be done in thissphere  especially on questions on which importantdifferences still exist.On the other hand  the Open-ended High-levelWorking Group on the Strengthening of the United NationsSystem is in the process of formulating recommendationsfor reform  with the General Assembly and the Secretariatas its main areas of interest. Turkey favours thecontinuation of the mandate of the Working Group toenable it to complete its work.The challenges and risks we face in the militarysecurity field call for measures that are broad in scope andapplication. This feature alone underscores the uniquemandate and authority of the United Nations to addressthese challenges in their global dimensions. Arms controland disarmament — focusing distinctly and with a sense ofurgency on measures and regimes destined to curb thealarming trends in the proliferation of weapons of massdestruction and in the technologies for their means ofdelivery — must remain high on our agenda.Turkey  as a Member State of the Conference onDisarmament  is pleased to have joined the overwhelmingmajority of nations in the efforts to conclude and adopt theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. The Treaty which I signed on 24 September  constitutes anindispensable step towards the eventual goal of a world freeof nuclear weapons.Accumulation of conventional weapons beyondlegitimate defense needs is inherently destabilizing.Devising responsible policies to be globally adhered to inarms transfers  with due regard to the impact of suchtransfers on regional and international stability  is not alesser priority. We must ensure that the United NationsRegister of Conventional Arms becomes a more effectivetool for monitoring and for transparency in transfers. Ona parallel track  the international community mustvigorously pursue a more concerted effort to eradicateillicit arms trafficking  not solely as an arms and export-control measure  but more importantly as a keycomponent in the international fight against terrorism.One of the most daunting tasks before the UnitedNations is to foster greater international solidarity andconcerted action against terrorism. We should not shyaway from the responsibility to meet this challenge head-on  because terrorism not only poses a threat tointernational peace and stability  but also violates the mostfundamental human right of all: the very right to live.International cooperation is imperative if we choose tolive free of fear. The United Nations has to play a centralrole in this respect. General Assembly resolutions onhuman rights and terrorism and a Declaration onMeasures to Eliminate International Terrorism aresignificant milestones  paving the way for effectiveinternational cooperation to eradicate this common enemy.In combating terrorism  we should not lose sight of thefact that what is equally important is to fight against  andnot to condone  the countries that are behind it.Transnational organized crime  with its connections todrug trafficking and terrorist organizations  also poses aserious threat to the stability of our societies. We willcontinue to vigorously support international cooperationto combat this evil.In 1995  we also celebrated the United Nations Yearfor Tolerance. A culture of tolerance — which is vital forconsolidating democracy and preventing ethnic conflicts racist tendencies and xenophobia — has been promotedthrough various international and regional activities underthe umbrella of the United Nations Educational  Scientificand Cultural Organization (UNESCO). Currentdevelopments unmistakably demonstrate how crucial it isto keep this precious concept alive within society and inbilateral  regional and international relations. We attachgreat importance to the follow-up of the Year and willpresent a draft resolution under the relevant agenda itemof the General Assembly.Located on the fault line of several regions fraughtwith conflicts and instability  Turkey naturally is seriouslyconcerned by developments on its periphery that threatenregional and international peace and security. We havebeen playing a crucial role in the efforts to find lastingand just solutions to the current problems. We are alsoactively taking part in various United Nations initiatives 5General Assembly 15th plenary meetingFifty-first session 30 September 1996including peacekeeping operations and preventivediplomacy activities.Turning to one of the questions that is high on ouragenda  our fundamental policy towards Iraq continues tobe our commitment to the territorial integrity  sovereigntyand independence of that country. The full compliance byIraq with all of its obligations under international law andrelevant Security Council resolutions remains vital for thereturn to normalcy in the region. Our main objective hereis the restoration of peace  stability and security on ourborders  as well as in the region as a whole. We are closelyfollowing the recent developments in northern Iraq  whichmay further aggravate the already delicate situation in theregion. To bring durable calm to the area  all segments ofthe local population — Kurds  Turkomans in particular since they have not been mentioned up to this point to theextent that they deserve; Arabs; Assyrians; and others —should fully participate in any local administrativearrangement  and their rights should be guaranteed.Northern Iraq should not be permitted to serve as an areathat poses a threat to the security of the neighbouringcountries. Turkey will not tolerate terrorist elements usingnorthern Iraq to stage terrorist acts against its territory. Weare determined to take all necessary measures to protect ourlegitimate security interests and to deny terrorist elementsthe possibility of launching terrorist operations against ourpopulation from northern Iraq.We have fulfilled our responsibilities emanating fromthe sanctions regime against Iraq  despite the extremeeconomic burden this has entailed for our country. Morethan six years after the sanctions’ inception  Turkey is nowat the forefront of the countries that have been directly andmost adversely affected by the sanctions regime. In fact  theheavy toll we have been required to pay has long exceededour ability to sustain the financial strain on our economy nor can we pay it any longer. Security Council resolution986 (1995)  when implemented  will alleviate the sufferingof the Iraqi people while also bringing limited relief forTurkey. However  this relief can in no way becommensurate with our losses. Consequently  we haveapplied to the United Nations Sanctions Committee with aview to obtaining further appropriate compensation withinthe framework of the sanctions regime. In this context  Iwish to reiterate that we attach great importance to theimplementation of Security Council resolution 986 (1995)as soon as possible.In the wider context of the Middle East  we areconcerned about what we hope will be only a temporaryimpasse in the Middle East peace process. As a devotedsupporter of the peace process  which we regard as theonly viable alternative for the region  we desire to see itpick up its momentum. This indisputably requires theparties to live up to their commitments.As we underlined in our statement before theSecurity Council on 27 September  any action that mayadversely affect the peace process should be avoided. TheIsraeli decision to open an entrance to a tunnel in thevicinity of the Mosque and the chain of reactions itprovoked are of that nature. We are deeply saddened bythe high number of casualties. We call on both sides toexercise utmost restraint and to prevent further violence.We urge the Israeli Government to review its decisionand to refrain from any action that can be construed asprovocation and from resorting to the use of force. Wewelcome Security Council resolution 1073 (1996). Weexpect President Arafat and Prime Minister Netanyahu tomeet immediately to find a way out of this crisis.One of the main obstacles blocking the path to acomprehensive peace in the Middle East continues to beterrorism. It must be eliminated if the quest for a lastingpeace and stability is to prevail. We advocate and standready to take part in enhanced cooperation on thebilateral  regional and international levels. Similarly  weexpect all countries to do their share to this very end. Itis with this understanding that we participated in thesummit of Sharm el-Sheikh  convened to demonstrate theresolve of the international community to fight againstterrorism on a united front. The eventual success of thepeace process will also hinge on our collective ability topromote mutually beneficial economic cooperation andinterdependence among the countries of the Middle East.As a Balkan country  we firmly believe that peace justice and legitimacy in the Balkans remain vital forinternational peace and stability. We hold the view thatany cooperative scheme in the Balkans should include alland exclude none. We were profoundly distressed for along time that  during the disintegration of the formerYugoslavia  lack of resolute international intervention atthe very outset of the aggression and war led tobloodshed and atrocities unparalleled in recent history.The developments that took place prior to the Daytonpeace Agreement proved once again that turning a blindeye to aggression only further aggravates crisis situations causing untold human suffering and making it all themore difficult to find solutions.We are actively participating in the implementationof both the military and civilian aspects of the Dayton6General Assembly 15th plenary meetingFifty-first session 30 September 1996peace Agreement  and in the international efforts toreconstruct and rehabilitate Bosnia and Herzegovina. Weare also conducting  together with the United States  a jointprogramme to train and equip the army of the Federation ofBosnia and Herzegovina in order to provide the Federationwith the means to preserve its territorial integrity and toensure military parity.We welcome the recently held elections in Bosnia andHerzegovina. We consider the realization of these elections despite existing hardships  an important development forBosnia and Herzegovina’s future. We hope that thisdevelopment will lead to the creation of a positive politicalclimate conducive to the attainment of lasting peace andstability and to the establishment of the constitutional legislative  administrative and security structures of Bosniaand Herzegovina. We urge the international community toremain committed to the cause of Bosnia and Herzegovina;to remain vigilant as regards any ill intention against theindependence and territorial integrity of that country; toensure the return of refugees and displaced persons to theirhomes; to seek the arrest and extradition to The Hague ofindicted war criminals; to prevent any negative outsideinterference that could potentially impede the process ofpeaceful and democratic reintegration; and to makeavailable the assistance pledged for the reconstruction andrehabilitation of Bosnia.Turkey enjoys good-neighbourly relations with theBalkan countries. However  a number of issues betweenTurkey and Greece  mostly related to the Aegean  remainunresolved. We have always advocated that disputes shouldbe settled by peaceful means and through dialogue andconstructive negotiations. Consequently  we have madeseveral appeals to Greece to seek an overall solution to allthe existing issues that stand between us. However  thisdoes not mean that we would accept any fait accompli. Westill expect Greece to give these appeals the fullconsideration and positive response they deserve. We wouldlike to hope that the new Greek Government  emergingfrom the recent elections  will adopt a more forthcomingstance in this regard. Unfortunately  the recent statement ofthe Greek Minister for Foreign Affairs  from this veryrostrum on 27 September  does not bode well. Distortionand misrepresentation of the established facts  as well asunfounded and unjustified allegations  will not serve thecreation of the climate of confidence and friendship wewish to see in our bilateral relations.In Cyprus  in the period that has elapsed since the lastsession of the General Assembly  regrettably no noticeabledevelopments have taken place towards a comprehensivesettlement. It has not been possible to resume the directtalks between the two sides under the mission of goodoffices of the United Nations Secretary-General  due tothe negative stance of the Greek Cypriots. The GreekCypriot side continues not to acknowledge that  in thepast  the United Nations negotiating process and directdialogue between the Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriotleaders not only served to establish the key parameters ofa final settlement — which are already on the table —but also played an important role in defusing tensionsbetween the two communities. It is all too evident thatattempts to derail the United Nations negotiating processcan only further complicate the already difficult road toa just solution.The recent regrettable events in and around thebuffer zone and  especially the slaying of a TurkishCypriot soldier  have proven once again what the lack ofdialogue as well as inflammatory rhetoric and provocationcan lead to. I hope that the Greek Cypriot side will notfail this time to draw the necessary conclusions. It isevident that the need to reduce tensions and build upconfidence on the island makes the resumption of thedirect talks  without any precondition  all the more urgent.The Turkish Cypriot side has already made public itsreadiness to this end. Turkey is committed to supportingthe renewed efforts of the United Nations and expects thesame constructive approach from Greece and the GreekCypriot side.Peace and legitimacy are yet to be restored inanother area of conflagration: the Caucasus. Indeed  thisregion continues to be wracked by various conflicts  thatcause immense human anguish and threaten peace security and stability. Turkey has close bonds with thecountries of the region and attaches utmost importance tothe preservation of regional peace and stability. Theongoing occupation of more than one fifth of the territoryof Azerbaijan by Armenian forces continues to be asource of grave concern for Turkey. More than onemillion Azeris are still displaced in their own country andliving in unacceptable conditions.They should not be permitted to endure anotherbitter winter in such conditions. Turkey has been strivingto help bring about a peaceful and just settlement of thedispute between Azerbaijan and Armenia. We willcontinue to contribute to the efforts of the Minsk Groupof the Organization for Security and Cooperation inEurope with a view to establishing peace  security andstability in the region. We earnestly believe that allcountries in the region have much to gain from the7General Assembly 15th plenary meetingFifty-first session 30 September 1996restoration of peace and legitimacy in the Caucasus. Theattainment of a just peace will pave the way for a climateof cooperation to serve the common prosperity of all thecountries of the region.The conflict in Abkhazia  Georgia  also continues tobe a source of distress. We attach the utmost importance tothe preservation of the territorial integrity  sovereignty andunity of Georgia and firmly believe that the internationalcommunity should deploy all efforts to bring about a justsolution to the conflict on that basis. To this end  we fullysupport the United Nations-sponsored peace talks betweenthe parties and stand ready to contribute to those efforts.One of the important aspects of the economicdevelopment of the Caucasus and Central Asia is theexportation of their natural resources  for which Turkey isin a position to provide easy access to world markets. I canmention here Turkey’s proposed Baku-Ceyhan oil-pipelineproject and natural-gas pipeline projects  which will servethe common interests and welfare of the entire region.Afghanistan is yet another conflict area where theinternational community has been unable to help bringabout a just and lasting solution. Our close ties with thatcountry are deeply rooted in history and we are troubled bythe tragic consequences of the ongoing conflict. We are alltoo aware of the possibility of a spillover effect of theconflict in the region. We believe that this terrible conflictmay be brought to an end and peace restored through directnegotiations between the fighting groups and the formationof a broad-based Government with the participation of allparties. Turkey is anxious to see  as soon as possible  thesigning of a ceasefire agreement and the beginning of peacenegotiations under the auspices of the United Nations. Wewill be pleased to host a meeting for such negotiations andwill continue to support fully the efforts of the UnitedNations Special Mission to mediate a settlement respectingthe territorial integrity  sovereignty and unity ofAfghanistan.As an extension of its geography and against thebackdrop of its history  Turkey finds itself at themultidirectional crossroads of several continents anddifferent cultures. It acts as an important bridge betweenEast and West  combining the values of the East with theideals and institutions of the West in a unique synthesis.Strong historical  cultural and fraternal ties exist betweenTurkey and the countries of the Balkans  the Caucasus Central Asia and the Middle East. We spare no effort incontributing to the resolution of conflicts and preventingnew ones from erupting  strengthening regional andinternational cooperation and promoting tolerance anddialogue. This is the very core and essence of the basicprinciples that define our foreign policy. We shallcontinue to place our assets at the disposal and service ofregional and global peace  stability and prosperity.In this context  I wish to underline the eminent roleplayed by Turkey in such regional cooperation schemesas the Black Sea Economic Cooperation and theEconomic Cooperation Organization  as well as its activeparticipation in cooperation in the Mediterranean basin.In conclusion  I wish to reiterate our sincere desireto see the fifty-first session of the General Assemblybecome an important milestone on the road to the thirdmillennium. We have to gather our strength  pool ourresources and ignite our imagination to build  collectively a better world. National interests and objectives willsurely remain at the core of our policies. However  on theeve of a new millennium  the time has certainly come totake a broader view and to replace rivalry withcooperation  intolerance with tolerance and confrontationwith dialogue and conciliation. We should at all costsavoid faits accomplis and double standards ininternational relations. A revitalized and reinvigoratedUnited Nations entering its second half-century can makea significant contribution to assisting us all to attain ourhighest goals and aspirations. Let us not forget  however that the task of shaping a better future is entirely in ourhands  for we are the United Nations."
"167",7063,"TZA",51,1996,"﻿Permit me at the outset tocongratulate you  Ambassador Razali  on your election tothe presidency of the fifty-first session of the GeneralAssembly. Your election is a fitting tribute to yourdistinguished career in diplomacy  an expression ofconfidence in your abilities and a reflection of the highregard in which you and your country  Malaysia  are heldby the international community. You have our confidence and I can assure you of Tanzania’s full support andcooperation as you guide the deliberations of this session.I commend also your predecessor  Mr. Freitas do Amaralof Portugal  who very ably presided over the historic fiftiethsession of the Assembly.My appreciation goes also to the Secretary-General His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  adistinguished son of Africa  who for the past five yearshas worked tirelessly to enhance the image of theOrganization as well as its ability to meet the challengesof the rapidly evolving international environment. He hasprovided dedicated leadership at a particularly difficulttime in the history of the United Nations  enduring oftenunwarranted personal criticism even as he was operatingin a situation of diminishing resources on the one hand and escalating  often conflicting  expectations on the otherhand.My predecessor in office stood at this rostrumexactly two years ago and  in bidding farewell to theUnited Nations  spoke of the political transition thenunder way in my country and of preparations for the firstmulti-party elections in Tanzania in over 30 years. Heunderlined his intention to bequeath to the people ofTanzania a functioning democracy leveraged upon ashared national culture of political accommodation andtolerance. Today  I am proud to be here as a product ofthat process of transition  to reaffirm our commitment andabiding faith in the United Nations in its endeavour topromote international peace and security as well aseconomic and social development throughout the world.The United Nations has  since its inception expanded its role in the international systemtremendously  becoming a major player in nationaldevelopment and international cooperation. The varioussummits that it has organized in recent years  coupledwith its numerous activities covering the entire spectrum ofpolitical  social and economic spheres  in all corners of theworld  is testimony to the critical role of the United Nationsin resolving the national and international problems facingmankind.The United Nations has helped maintain internationalpeace and security at very critical times. It has overseen thedelivery of peoples and nations from the shackles ofcolonialism and institutionalized racism to independence.As a result of these efforts  membership has increasedalmost fourfold. The ideals of freedom and justice andhuman rights are understood by most of the world  even ifthey may not always be observed. The United Nations hasbuilt a common global culture of shared values  and it hasalso helped in promoting development  building social andeconomic infrastructures and much more.Today  the United Nations stands at a crossroads. Newchallenges  not least those brought about by a rapidlychanging international environment  keep demanding itsundivided attention. The challenge before us  as we standon the threshold of the new millennium  is to invigorate andreinforce this Organization  drawing upon the collectiveresources and knowledge of our world and acting inpartnership.Likewise  the ideal we all share for participatorydemocracy in each Member country needs to findexpression on the international plane as well. In the courseof the last few years  we have agonized over the process ofreform within this Organization. We all want an efficientand revitalized United Nations — one that is more attunedto the realities we live with and capable of meeting the newchallenges we face. We must reform its methods of workand bring greater institutional and policy coherence into theOrganization. Adjustment and realignment are necessaryprocesses for the renewal and continued relevance of thisOrganization. Tanzania salutes all those individuals institutions and Governments that have contributed to thisprocess of review.It is our hope  however  that any reform will preserveand enhance the basic principles underlying the UnitedNations. We want reform — but only the kind of reformthat will ultimately strengthen the hand of our Organizationin promoting its ideals. We want greater transparency in thework of our institutions  and the reinforcement of theprinciples of sovereign equality of States and justice. Weneed democratization of our institutions  and greater balancein representation on the Security Council between thedeveloped North and the developing South.We cannot  however  expect the United Nations tobe  and do  all this and more without giving it the meanswith which to work. Meeting our financial obligations tothe Organization must  therefore  complement ourdemands upon the Organization and serve to demonstrateour commitment to the ideals it seeks to promote.Just as we have the right to applaud theachievements of the United Nations  we must also havethe courage to concede that it has yet to make a dent inthe scourge of abject poverty that afflicts the greater partof its membership. This is where we must now direct itsattention and resources. The 1995 World Summit forSocial Development in Copenhagen was a good startingpoint  and we must implement the letter and spirit of thecommitments made there. Unless the issue of poverty isaddressed comprehensively  we cannot achievemeaningful and enduring peace. We must restore thedevelopment agenda to the heart of the philosophy andwork of the United Nations.The world is largely considered peaceful becausethere has not been a third world war. Yet  for those whoare menaced by regional conflicts  for the victims ofoppression and injustice  and for those who subsist inunremitting poverty amid a world of plenty  their worldis at war. Taken together  these people account for thelargest part of the world population  and the UnitedNations must give them the attention they deserve today.Our United Nations cannot speak of a peaceful worldwhen the future of our children — and their right to growup as children — is undermined by conflict and poverty and when urban squalor is breeding anarchy in localcommunities. Peace must be pursued in a comprehensivemanner  taking account of these equal  if not greater threats to peace within societies and among countries.Our collective shame at poverty amid riches mustfind expression in our joint action to promotedevelopment. Today  the developing world is bombardedby many development initiatives. We are urged to workharder  to liberalize our economies  to cut Governmentspending  to institute sound macroeconomic policies  topromote the private sector and a host of other measures.Invariably  our countries have done so  quite often atgreat social expense  the magnitude of which developedcountries would not countenance in their own economies.We have done so in the knowledge that ultimately itis we who must take the bull by the horns. Indeed  weaccept that we must be more competitive in the marketplace and bring greater efficiency to Government. We2need to use our resources more rationally; we need to fightwaste and corruption in Government; we need to streamlineour bureaucratic processes  liberalize our economies andopen our markets to international commerce. That is whymost of us are signatories to the establishment of the newworld trade regime under the auspices of the World TradeOrganization. Yet our capacity to access  and benefit from the global markets — the markets of the developedworld — is constrained by our underdevelopment  theprotectionist policies of the industrialized countries  and theever-deteriorating terms of trade.Unregulated market forces will not help the veryweak  poor and vulnerable countries  whose specialcircumstances and needs must be attended to. For us  thatis the priority agenda for the World Trade Organization  notthe introduction of new issues before we perfect the systemwe have now. The Ruggiero plan to extend tariff-freeaccess in the markets of industrialized countries to productsfrom developing countries is welcome and deserves widesupport.We now need a mutually beneficial creativepartnership between the developed North and thedeveloping South. Sustainable economic recovery andgrowth in the South is beneficial to the North as well. Onlya prosperous South will be a more meaningful player inglobal commerce. We shall then be able to buy more fromthe North  thus freeing the conscience of the developedworld from the unending obligation to extend charity  andcontrol illegal immigration. This creative partnership mustalso recognize the interdependent nature of our world andhow ultimately we affect each other. To help the Southrecover is not an act of simple charity but of building thefoundations for a more secure and stable world. We madea call for action at the ninth United Nations Conference onTrade and Development (UNCTAD IX) at Midrand inSouth Africa earlier this year. We must reiterate that calltoday.Tanzania  like the rest of the developing countries  isdetermined to face its responsibilities for economic andhuman development. We cannot  however  makemeaningful progress when the millstone of external debtcontinues to hang around our necks  stifling recovery andgrowth. The question of the unbearable external debt mustbe addressed urgently if our creative partnership againstglobal poverty is to bear fruit.Many proposals for debt relief have been discussedover time. We recognize and appreciate these initiatives including the recent proposals for extraordinary debt reliefmeasures for a selected group of severely indebtedcountries. The fact remains  however  that nocomprehensive action is imminent save for limitedmeasures taken unilaterally  on a case-by-case basis.Urgent  coordinated and comprehensive action remainsnecessary to alleviate this debt burden  including thecancellation of the debts of least developed countries whose servicing obligations gobble up their entireearnings. Only then can we hope for an economicturnaround for them. It is the duality of debt cancellationand access to markets that will enable countries likeTanzania to benefit in a liberalized world market place and hasten the pace of social and economic development.Another heavy burden for developing countries especially those without fossil fuel sources of energy  isthe cost input of energy for development. In thisconnection  I wish to hail the World Solar Summit  heldon 16 and 17 September 1996 in Harare  which helped tofocus world political attention on the urgent andimperative need to provide reliable  sustainable and cleansources of energy to all the people of the world  includingto the 400 million homes and the 2.4 billion people in thedeveloping world who currently have no access toelectricity. We all know that  without electricity  no rapiddevelopment of those communities will be forthcoming.The Harare Summit agreed on a framework for a10-year solar energy programme. We must all give it thepolitical support it needs and deserves if it is to beeffective. At the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro we all agreed that failure to develop sustainable and cleansources of energy would result in problems for all of us rich and poor alike. Deforestation in Africa  LatinAmerica and Asia will affect the countries involved andnot involved alike. As long as 92.8 per cent of the energyrequirements in Tanzania are met from wood fuel  thereis no way that the Government can protect the naturalforests unless alternative sources of energy are availableat affordable rates. It is in the interest of all humanity andof future generations to facilitate the development ofalternative  affordable  sustainable and clean sources ofenergy for everyone.Tanzania is concerned at the lack of progress in theimplementation of the United Nations peace plan forWestern Sahara. The international community cannot andmust not retreat from this unfinished business. We mustreaffirm the inalienable right of the Sahraoui people toself-determination and independence and  to that end support the holding of a free and fair referendum. Weurge the two sides  the Kingdom of Morocco and the3Frente Polisario  to initiate direct talks  which would createa climate of confidence and permit the resumption of theimplementation of the settlement plan.We wish to keep our hopes alive with regard to thesituation in the Middle East and earnestly call for faster andstrict implementation of the peace accords. The IsraeliGovernment has a particular responsibility in this respect.We reached a time when we thought that our dreams forthe peaceful coexistence of the Palestinian people and theIsraeli people were on the verge of coming true. Wecommend all those who have been instrumental inpromoting the peace process. We urge greater restraint onall sides  which must accept that the secure way tosustainable peace and security is through negotiation.I shall now turn to the Burundi crisis. We see our rolein Burundi as one not of benevolence  but of duty — dutyto help our brothers and sisters there to step back from thebrink of mutual destruction to the middle ground ofdialogue  political accommodation and nationalreconciliation. We began our efforts within the Organizationof African Unity and gradually turned over the task ofbringing the political forces in sustained dialogue to formerPresident  Mwalimu Julius Nyerere  within the frameworkof the Mwanza talks. Not only was the military coup of 25July 1996 an illegal and unconstitutional act; it alsoundermined the efforts in the region to promote dialogueand restore peace to that most tormented country. The coupis unacceptable to all regional leaders and we demand areturn to legitimacy and a negotiated political settlementthat will guarantee democracy and the security ofminorities.In order to speed up the process of compliance  theregion has imposed economic sanctions on Burundi. Thosesanctions will remain in place until all the conditions set atArusha are met by the military rulers in Bujumbura. Theseare not unreasonable conditions. They are the restoration ofthe National Assembly  which is a democratic institution oflegality that derived its mandate from the Burundian people;removing the ban on political parties in the country; and theresumption of unconditional political negotiations with allthe parties to the conflict. We have  at the same time  madeit clear to the Burundi people that the sanctions are meantonly to secure the compliance of their military rulers withthese conditions  and nothing more. Once this has beendone  Tanzania  the region and  indeed  the internationalcommunity have all reiterated that they are prepared toresume their assistance and cooperation in the process ofrestoring peace and rebuilding that country. We can allpledge our help  but the challenge of making peace is onethat only the Burundian people and those who claimleadership of that country can shoulder. The onus ofbringing peace to their county rests squarely upon theirshoulders. The key to a sustainable solution is in theirown hands. We can only help.At the same time we  the neighbours and the rest ofthe international community  have an inescapableresponsibility to save the Burundian people from self-destruction. We cannot stand by and watch theperpetuation of killings  the steady degeneration of thesecurity situation and the catastrophe they portend for thecountry and the subregion.As we seek to help the Burundian people retrace thepath of dialogue  we remain preoccupied by the fragilityof the political situation in the Great Lakes region as awhole. While Rwanda is steadily progressing along thepath of recovery  the wounds of war and genocide haveyet to heal. That country needs the solidarity and supportof the international community.One of the serious consequences of conflict in theregion has been the massive human displacement  andrefugees now constitute a tremendous burden for theneighbouring countries. Tanzania is currently hosting over1 million refugees from Rwanda and Burundi. Theimplications of their presence in such large numberswithin limited localities have been tremendous in terms ofthe destruction of the environment  increased insecurityand criminality  and the social and economic burden theyhave imposed upon the host communities. The traditionalhospitality of Tanzanians towards refugees is wearingvery thin indeed.We appreciate the work of the Office of the UnitedNations High Commissioner for Refugees and otherhumanitarian agencies in offering protection and succourto the refugees. What they have done is very useful  butit is not enough to offset the burden that these refugeesplace upon our communities. We call upon theinternational community  in the name of human solidarity to redouble its assistance to meet the urgent needs ofthese refugees  while at the same time addressing thelong-term effects attendant on hosting them. Above all we must help both Rwanda and Burundi to address theroot causes of these human displacements. The ultimategoal must be the voluntary repatriation of the refugees totheir home countries. To us  the creation of anenvironment that will facilitate such a process ofrepatriation is now a priority.4Whether in Liberia  Somalia or elsewhere in theworld  we see the need for courage and statesmanship todefeat the temptations of political unilateralism and promotedialogue and greater human solidarity. The courage to riseabove deep-seated prejudices and fears — the courage todepart from traditional rigidity that has made conflictendemic in some parts of the world — is the key that willopen up a new era of dialogue  political accommodationand national concord. We have seen how such courage andstatesmanship can reverse long-standing hostilities and buildon the realism of our shared destiny as human beings. TheMiddle East  Bosnia and Herzegovina  South Africa andAngola are cases in point. Difficulties remain  but we havecrossed the Rubicon and  with determination  we canmaintain a steady pace towards peace in these and otherareas around the world. The United Nations played a keyrole in this task. It will have to play an even greater role inconsolidating the progress towards peace.The end of the cold war did not  unfortunately  usherin the spring of collective peace and the blossoming of theflowers of international cooperation. The world is stilldivided — even if not on ideological lines — betweenthose who are armed and those who are unarmed. Vastnuclear arsenals remain and their technologicalimprovement continues unabated. The hopes for collectivepeace run the risk of being thwarted by the unilateralism ofthose who are armed with the most deadly weapons. Mycountry is concerned about the vertical proliferation ofweapons of mass destruction and the unremitting desire ofthose who have them to rationalize their possession. Thisundermines peace.Since the coming into force two years ago of the 1982United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea  we havewitnessed the establishment of the various institutionsenvisaged in the Convention. We are pleased that  at longlast  there is positive movement towards ensuring theregularized use of the oceans and their resources to thebenefit of all people the world over. The Government ofTanzania attaches great importance to ensuring that themake-up of the International Seabed Authority in itsformative years is so structured as to facilitate the carryingout of its responsibilities in the manner envisaged in theConvention and implementation Agreement of 1994.The establishment of the International Tribunal on theLaw of the Sea has added a fillip to the Convention  andthe election of its judges last August was another milestonein the work of the United Nations. In this connection  weexpress our appreciation to the States Parties to theConvention on the Law of the Sea for electing a Tanzanian The Honourable Joseph S. Warioba  as one of the judgesof the Tribunal. We congratulate all members of theTribunal on being entrusted with such an historic mission.The founding of the United Nations was inspired bythe human solidarity which the world sought to promotefive decades ago. It is that solidarity which our nationsgathered here last year to commemorate. What holds ournations together  despite their diversity  is the commonbond and solidarity we feel for each other as humanbeings.Today  more than ever before  we need thatsolidarity in order to deal with the myriad problems weall face together: the problems of poverty andunderdevelopment  peace and security  justice and humanrights  disarmament and the environment  internationalterrorism and drug trafficking and many others. Allrequire joint and coordinated international action. Thosemore powerful amongst us can try to solve theseproblems unilaterally  but in order for their efforts to bearfruit  they too need the cooperation of everyone. That iswhy I invite this Assembly to embark on a mission torediscover human solidarity and to build structures forglobal partnership  the better world which the foundingfathers of this Organization set out to establish 51 yearsago.As an African leader  I wish to end my speech bycommending and supporting the United NationsSecretary-General for the United Nations System-wideSpecial Initiative on Africa he launched on 15 March ofthis year  which seeks to provide coordinated actionacross the entire United Nations system over a 10-yearperiod to address the unique development needs of theAfrican continent. It is my hope that coming in the wakeof the Copenhagen Social Summit  it will benefit fromthat Summit’s commitments and create the kind of impactthat has long been missing in previous summitdeclarations and plans of action.Africa is a continent with an ancient and richhistory. It is richly endowed with human and naturalresources. I have great hopes for Africa and  being part ofits new leadership  I pledge to work with anyone whoshares my conviction that Africa is positioned for politicaland economic renewal  reform and reconstruction fordevelopment. Together  we can realize the dream of amore peaceful  a more developed and a more respectedcontinent. Together  we can realize the dream of a worldcloser than ever to the ideals set out in the United NationsCharter over 50 years ago.5"
"168",7106,"UGA",51,1996,"﻿It is a pleasure and anhonour for me to address this Assembly. From this loftyrostrum  the nations of the world speak to one another asmembers of one global community  irrespective of sizeand differences. The United Nations is today the besthope for a better future for humankind. What we do heremust therefore contribute positively and effectivelytowards the achievement of the noble purposes andprinciples enshrined in the Charter of our Organization.Permit me  Sir  on behalf of the delegation ofUganda  to express how pleased we are at your electionto the presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-firstsession. Your well-deserved election is a great honour toyour country  Malaysia  with which Uganda enjoys verycordial bilateral relations. I wish to pledge our fullsupport to you  Sir  and to affirm our confidence in yourability to guide our deliberations to a successfulconclusion. Allow me also to pay a special tribute to yourpredecessor  Ambassador Diogo Freitas do Amaral ofPortugal  for the able manner in which he presided overthe work of the fiftieth session of the General Assembly.I salute our Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for his commitment and dedication to the globalmission of the United Nations during the past five years.The United Nations continues to be confronted withthe challenge of redressing the development disparitiesthat exist among nations  particularly between the fewrich countries and the majority of impoverished ones. For9the latter  these disparities are manifest in widespreadpoverty and the degradation of their ecosystems. They arealso a major cause of the spiral of violence and internalconflicts  with their attendant suffering and destruction.In an increasingly interdependent world  theseproblems have regional as well as global consequences. Itwould therefore be wishful thinking to treat them as if theywere a concern of only the affected countries and regions.They must be addressed through global approaches andstrategies that ensure lasting solutions.We note that present advances in transport communications and information technology have resultedin the increasing globalization of the world economy. Bothliberalization and globalization offer opportunities as wellas challenges within and among nations. These twinphenomena have  in addition  deepened the marginalizationof some regions  particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Thisprocess could breed further polarization within countries with very destructive and destabilizing consequences. Wewish to underscore the continuing relevance ofmultilateralism and international cooperation asprerequisites for equitable global growth and developmentand for addressing the negative consequences ofglobalization.The increasing trend towards unfair trading practicesand conflicts in international trade is a matter of seriousconcern for us. We are witnessing situations in whichdeveloping countries are pushed to open up their markets ostensibly to advance free trade and competition  while atthe same time developed countries practice managed tradeand limit access to some export products from developingcountries. This contradiction is unhealthy for the worldeconomy.The establishment of the World Trade Organization(WTO) in 1994 as an entity to act as a custodian andguarantor of a rules-based multilateral trading system is apositive development. We therefore welcome the conveningof the first Ministerial Meeting of the World TradeOrganization in Singapore in December 1996. The Meetingshould  in our opinion  give a clear policy direction to theWTO for the next two years on measures to redressimbalances existing in the present multilateral tradingsystem  which are to the disadvantage of many developingcountries  particularly the least developed ones.The Meeting should therefore give high priority toundertaking a comprehensive review of the implementationof the Uruguay Round agreements  with a view toadopting specific and concrete measures to obviateadverse effects to the least developed countries and netfood-importing developing countries arising from theimplementation of the agreements; reverse themarginalization of the least developed countries; andstrengthen their capacity to compete in the globaleconomy. These measures must include long-termfinancial and technical support  the transfer of technologyas critical elements for the effective implementation of theUruguay agreements and in the improvement of the tradeperformance of developing countries.With regard to the proposal that the Meeting addressissues outside the WTO built-in agenda  we would preferto benefit first from the analytical advice of the UnitedNations Conference on Trade and Development on thepolicy implications of such issues to international tradebefore they are taken up by the WTO. In our view  theMeeting should focus on issues relating to the fullimplementation of agreed commitments  such as theprovision of financial  technical and technological supportto developing countries  as well as those aimed atstemming and reversing the distortive factors to trade.The increasing role of transnational corporations inthe international trade in goods and services and in theflow of private capital has inordinately enhanced theircontrol over resources and the transfer of technology andknow-how in developing countries. In some cases  thiscontrol is beyond the capacity of many developingcountries to check. As the influence of these corporationsgrows with globalization  there is an urgent need toelaborate and adopt an effective and legally-bindinginternational code of conduct to regulate the activities andinfluence of transnational corporations.We are committed to subregional and regionalcooperation and integration. Within the East Africansubregion  we have participated actively in the revival ofEast African cooperation  in the strengthening of theCommon Market for Eastern and Southern Africa  and inintensifying efforts to make operational the Abuja Treatyestablishing the African Economic Community. It is ourbelief that enhanced subregional and regional cooperationand integration are critical to complement South-Southcooperation and international cooperation fordevelopment. It is also a means of enhancing10competitiveness and thereby improving our performance inthe world economy. In efforts to further strengthencooperation in East Africa  we propose the establishment ofa cooperation arrangement between the East AfricanCommunity and the United Nations. We appeal to theinternational community to support these efforts.The magnitude of debt and its servicing obligationscontinues to impose a serious obstacle to our developmentefforts. As of March 1996  for example  Uganda’s totalexternal indebtedness stood at $3.2 billion — whichrepresented 67.5 per cent of its gross domestic product —of which 75 per cent was owed to multilateral financialinstitutions. Debt-servicing was $141 million  or 27 per centof export earnings. Projected debt-servicing for the 1996-1997 fiscal year is $184 million  or 35.8 per cent of exportearnings. This precarious situation is compounded by thecurrent rigorous debt-repayment enforcement regimepursued by creditor multilateral financial institutions.Uganda is committed to fulfilling its debt obligationswithin the means available to it. In this regard  amultilateral debt fund has been established to offset the debtowed to the International Development Association  theInternational Monetary Fund and the African DevelopmentBank’s African Development Fund. We are grateful to allbilateral donors who have continued to support and makedirect contributions to the fund. We also appeal to otherdonors to join in this worthy endeavour in order to augmentthe resources of the fund  which are still very low.To complement these efforts  we make a specialappeal to the international community  and particularly tothe multilateral financial institutions  to adopt concretemeasures to effect a drastic reduction of externalindebtedness of least developed countries and other severelyindebted developing countries. In this regard  we commendas a first step the debt relief initiatives currently in place such as the Naples Terms. In our view  however  thesemeasures remain grossly inadequate to have any meaningfulimpact. There is therefore a need to augment them withadditional measures that substantially reduce all types ofdebts  including those which entail debt write-offs orconverting part or all of our debt into grants.We note with appreciation the recent measures by theBretton Woods institutions to put in place measures for debtrelief. We urge the dominant shareholders to support thesemeasures.African countries  including Uganda  continue to beadversely affected by record-low levels of exportcommodity earnings. The situation is aggravated by tariffand non-tariff barriers imposed by our trading partners onour semi-processed and processed export products and bydeclining terms of trade due to increased prices ofimported manufactured goods and services. We urge theadoption of concrete support measures to improve ourexport earnings. This could include assistance in the areasof horizontal and vertical diversification of oureconomies  as well as capacity-building.Today is World Habitat Day. It is a day for theinternational community to reflect on and reaffirm itscommitment to the plight of the one billion people in allparts of the world who lack adequate shelter and basicservices  such as safe water supplies and sanitationfacilities. It is also a day to dedicate ourselves to theobjective of finding lasting solutions to the problems ofhomelessness and other social ills associated with rapidurbanization.The maintenance of international peace and securityremains a formidable challenge for the United Nations.Efforts in this regard continue to be undermined byconflicts and tensions arising from inadequate politicalleadership that cannot correctly handle ethnic  religiousand social differences in those affected areas. These haveundermined the rule of law  peace and security  and havecontributed to untold suffering in many of the affectedcountries.In Africa  civil strife and internal conflicts  with theirattendant consequences  are afflicting several countries tovarying degrees. For instance  we are gravely concernedby the suffering imposed on the people of northernUganda by renegade groups. These terrorist acts must bestopped forthwith for the sake of peace and security inour subregion.The conflict in Burundi is a serious threat to thepeace and security of that country as well as to thesubregion. Uganda appeals to all the parties concerned toaccept the mediation efforts of former President JuliusNyerere  which are aimed at achieving a peaceful politicalsolution to the conflict through compromise andaccommodation in the context of the Arusha initiative andpeace process.In this regard  Uganda urges all the partiesconcerned to resume  as a matter of urgency 11unconditional political negotiations in order to establishpeace and security for all Burundians. We are committed toworking closely with other countries in the subregion tofind a lasting political solution to the problems of Burundithrough dialogue and national reconciliation.The steps taken by the Government of Rwandatowards the restoration of normalcy and achieving nationalreconciliation are steps in the right direction. These stepsshould be encouraged and supported  as they provide abasis for restoring mutual confidence and trust  which arecritical for a peaceful return and reintegration of Rwandeserefugees from neighbouring countries.We are concerned about the chaotic situation inSomalia and call for the reinvigoration of the Organizationof African Unity (OAU) peace efforts.Common sense must prevail among the warringfactions in Liberia so that the people of that unhappycountry may be given a chance to enjoy peace  security andnational reconciliation. We welcome the efforts of theEconomic Community of West African States in thisconnection.With regard to Angola  we note that theimplementation of the Lusaka Protocol is under way. Weencourage both parties to stay the course.The efforts of the OAU and the Yamoussoukroumediation efforts of President Bédié of Côte d’Ivoire toseek a peaceful solution to the conflict in Sierra Leoneshould be encouraged.Uganda supports the just struggle of the Sahraouipeople for self-determination. To this end  we urge thespeedy resolution of the conflict in Western Sahara  inaccordance with the relevant resolutions of the SecurityCouncil and the General Assembly.Uganda supports the efforts of the United Nations andthe appropriate regional organizations to diffuse conflictsthrough preventive diplomacy  as well as through themechanisms of peacekeeping and peacemaking  includingdialogue and confidence-building. In this regard  wereaffirm our support for the OAU Mechanism for ConflictPrevention  Management and Resolution  as well as for itsCentral Organ. The Mechanism and the Central Organshould be supported and provided with the necessaryresources to enable them to operate effectively.The idea of encouraging African Member States toput in place contingent arrangements for deployment insituations requiring peacekeeping or military observermissions in Africa has merit and deserves support. At thesame time  humanitarian programmes with built-inmechanisms that address the continuum from emergencyrelief to rehabilitation  recovery and long-termdevelopment are essential to restoring lasting peace.We welcome the adoption of the ComprehensiveNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. However  we urge the nuclear-weapon States to seize this opportunity to committhemselves to adopting concrete time- frames for the totalelimination of all nuclear weapons  as well as to stoppingthe qualitative development and refinement of nucleararsenals  including through computer simulation.Most African countries have embraced and arevigorously pursuing far-reaching political and economicreforms. In Uganda  we have implemented fundamentaleconomic reforms consistent with our developmentpriorities and strategies and the structural adjustmentprogrammes of the Bretton Woods institutions. We haveliberalized trade and created the necessary conditions forencouraging and promoting both domestic and foreigndirect investment. We have improved our economicmanagement systems  with strong emphasis on fiscal andmonetary discipline. We have endeavoured to integrateand implement the outcome of the major internationalconferences into our national development plans andpriorities.However  in order to nurture these positivedevelopments and improve the well-being of our citizens we need concerted cooperation and support from theinternational community by ensuring  among others  afavourable external economic environment.I am glad to state that Uganda is a nation restoredboth politically and economically. Allow me to outlinebriefly the measures that have been taken and which areresponsible for peace  security and the other positivechanges that prevail in Uganda today. These positivechanges are the result of a policy of reconciliation. Forus  reconciliation itself is a means to an end  the endbeing national unity.In pursuance of this objective  we instituted from thevery beginning the principle of a broad-based Governmentwhich accommodated all shades of political opinion andideologies. The pillar of the democratization process is12the nationwide political participation in decision-making atall levels  which has empowered people to take charge oftheir own governance.Uganda remains committed to the protection andpromotion of human rights. A Human Rights Commissionhas been established to oversee the observance of humanrights in Uganda. The Commission is complemented by anational human rights unit in the Ministry of Justice andsimilar units will be established in the near future at thedistrict level. We have ensured that the promotion of humanrights includes a component to redress the inequality ofopportunities through affirmative action in favour ofdisadvantaged groups such as women  youths and thedisabled.In this regard  the 1995 Constitution of Ugandaprovides for special representation in Parliament for thesegroups. We appreciate the support extended to us so far inthis area and welcome further technical and financialsupport  especially towards the review and finalization ofappropriate legislation and the strengthening of relevanthuman rights entities at various levels.Last year  a new Constitution was promulgated aftermore than a year of intense debate by a ConstituentAssembly of directly-elected members. On 9 May 1996  thefirst-ever free and fair presidential elections were held followed by parliamentary elections on 27 June 1996.Today  Uganda has its first-ever directly-elected Presidentsince independence in 1962.In Uganda  we share the view that decentralization isa necessary condition for good governance andempowerment because democracy cannot thrive unlessspace is given for civil society to operate. In pursuance ofthis  political decentralization is not only enshrined in theConstitution  but is already being implemented. Such atransfer of power to the districts and other lower tiers hasremoved the remoteness of government and ensured aspeedier delivery of goods and services to the people.Years of war and economic mismanagement have leftUganda with a shattered economy. The presentadministration has continued to make steady progress inrestoring the economy under the framework of theEconomic Reform Programme. Inflation has beensuccessfully controlled since June 1992 at the level of 5.6per cent  on average. At the same time  Uganda has enjoyeda high average rate of economic growth of 8.1 per cent dueto macroeconomic stability and strict monetary policies.In order to attract investments  an Investment Codewas instituted to ensure a friendly and conduciveinvestment environment. The Uganda InvestmentAuthority was established as a one-stop centre forinformation.Uganda commends various initiatives taken by theUnited Nations to eradicate poverty. Special mentionshould be made of the World Social Summit  the UnitedNations New Agenda for the Development of Africa inthe 1990s and the United Nations System-wide SpecialInitiative for Africa. We commend this spirit ofinternational partnership aimed at addressing persistentpoverty in our region. For its part  the Government ofUganda has embarked on the long road of addressing theproblem by ensuring that the fruits of economic growthreach the masses of the population. Among the strategiesin place is an Action Plan for the Eradication of Povertywith a Poverty Task Force as its implementing agency. Inthe short and medium terms  the Action Plan focuses onincreasing household income  primary education and roadinfrastructure. The political and economic achievementsregistered so far prove that a serious  visionary andcommitted Government can lead donor conditionalitiesrather than be led by them.We have just concluded the mid-term review of theimplementation of the United Nations New Agenda forthe Development of Africa in the 1990s. For thesatisfactory outcome of the meeting  we wish to thankmost profoundly the Government of Japan and alldelegations which participated actively in this exercise.One of the fundamental conclusions of the review is thata lot remains to be done to consolidate the modestpolitical and socio-economic progress that has beenachieved in some parts of the African continent. This willrequire the mobilization of substantial new and additionalresources and  in particular  the provision of a conduciveexternal economic environment. The review alsodemonstrated that a partnership based on sharedresponsibility and mutuality of interest is possible andinevitable.The United Nations remains a custodian of manycherished ideals  such as the primacy of democraticgovernance. The United Nations was born out of ayearning for a democratic multilateral system capable ofaddressing problems brought about by hideous tensions13and conflicts throughout the world  with a view to makingplanet Earth a more secure  just and friendly place forpresent and future generations. We all agree on the need tostrengthen the United Nations so that it can carry out itsglobal mandate effectively. We should therefore provide itwith adequate resources. This commitment  invariably  callsupon each Member State to meet its financial obligations tothe organization in full  on time and without conditions.Within the context of strengthening the Organization measures should be adopted to achieve its democratizationat all levels. Since there is a worldwide trend towardsdemocratization  this Organization cannot remain unaffectedby these winds of change. Uganda therefore supportsproposals to restructure the Security Council in order tobring transparency to its working methods  democracy to itsdecision-making procedures and equity to reflect theincreased membership of the United Nations.The United Nations remains  in our view  theappropriate central forum for addressing global problemsconfronting the international community. It must bestrengthened  revitalized and democratized. This is thechallenge that we the peoples of the United Nations mustaddress as a matter of priority."
"169",7153,"UKR",51,1996,"﻿It is my honour tocongratulate you  Sir  on your election to the post ofPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-firstsession. On behalf of the Ukrainian delegation  I wouldalso like to express my appreciation to Mr. Freitasdo Amaral  who presided so efficiently over the lastsession and encouraged an intensive exchange of opinionson the role of the United Nations in today’s world.A year ago  at the commemorative session of theGeneral Assembly  our Organization received a substantialcredit of trust as a universal international institutionwhich  in the Declaration on the Occasion of the FiftiethAnniversary of the United Nations  was called upon to“create new opportunities for peace  development democracy and cooperation.” (resolution 50/6  thirdpreambular para.)Today  we can assert that the United Nations hasbeen and remains the key mechanism for maintaining andstrengthening peace and security — and there is muchproof of that. There is no doubt that the past year hasbeen extremely important for arms control anddisarmament. Tomorrow  27 September  I will have thehonour to sign  on behalf of Ukraine  the ComprehensiveNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT)  as adopted in historicresolution 50/245. This important instrument calls for thede jure affirmation of the end of the nuclear-arms-raceera. In signing this Treaty  Ukraine will make yet anothercontribution to disarmament  the importance of whichcannot be overstated.In this context  I recall another historic event: thefinal withdrawal of strategic nuclear warheads from theterritory of Ukraine. Having eliminated the world’s third-largest nuclear arsenal  which we had inherited  Ukrainebecame a nuclear-weapon-free State on 1 June 1996. Indoing so  we believe that Ukraine made an unprecedentedcontribution  which has not yet received adequaterecognition by the international community  todiminishing the global nuclear threat and thereby9demonstrated to the whole world its peaceful  consistentand reliable policy. Accordingly  we expect the nuclearStates strictly to adhere to their commitments relating to thesecurity assurances given to Ukraine by the United Statesof America  Russia  the United Kingdom  China and Francein December 1994.Ukraine’s important role in the new European securityarchitecture has been recognized recently in severalinternational documents. For us  this means a specialresponsibility for the maintenance of stability in the wholeof Europe. We therefore believe that the process of nucleardisarmament should become more dynamic. In this context the initiative put forward by the President of Ukraine Leonid Kuchma  with regard to the creation of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central and Eastern Europe betweenthe Baltic and the Black Seas is the next logical step and animportant move in the right direction. I would like toemphasize that the possible deployment of nuclear weaponson the territories of our neighbours in Central and EasternEurope is a matter of great concern to us. We believe thatsupport for the idea of a non-nuclear Central Europe wouldpromote an atmosphere of confidence between and amongthe States of the region and prevent the emergence of newdividing lines on the European continent. By adding to theexisting zones in Antarctica  the South Pacific  LatinAmerica and the Caribbean  as well as the nuclear-weapon-free zones in South-East Asia and Africa  the creation of anuclear-weapon-free zone in Central and Eastern Europewould create the “critical mass” that would foster theprocess of global nuclear disarmament.In our opinion  the Conference on Disarmament  whichincludes Ukraine as a new  full-fledged member  shouldimmediately start developing a programme of completenuclear disarmament with a view to bringing closer therealization of Ukraine’s appeal for a twenty-first centurywithout nuclear weapons.Among other important international achievements ofthe past year  I would like to refer to the beginning of thepeace settlement in the former Yugoslavia. It is importantto remember that the peace-keeping efforts of the UnitedNations were not in vain. Risking their lives in difficultconditions  the Blue Helmets have fulfilled their missionand prevented the spillover of the conflict. In this context I would like to draw the attention of the Assembly to thenecessity of the speedy entry into force and implementationof the 1994 Convention on the Safety of United Nationsand Associated Personnel.We hope that the peace process initiated in Daytonhas become irreversible. The proof of this will be in thesuccessful implementation of the military aspects of thePeace Agreement by the Implementation Force (IFOR)and of the recent elections held in Bosnia under theauspices of the Organization for Security and Cooperationin Europe (OSCE).In general  we think that recent international effortsin the former Yugoslavia have been a success not only fora peace settlement. In my opinion  we have alsowitnessed the appearance of a potential machinery foreffective cooperation between various internationalstructures in crisis management. I refer in particular to animportant experience of the Implementation Force (IFOR)operation carried out  under the mandate of the SecurityCouncil  by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization(NATO)  its partners — including Ukraine — and othercountries. At the same time  the ultimate success of thepeace process will be impossible without the active andaction-oriented involvement of the Organization forSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in theimplementation of civil aspects of the Agreement. Theconcerted efforts by the United Nations  NATO and theOSCE to settle one of the most tragic conflicts of ourtime prove that political will and a clear division offunctions between the respective structures make itpossible to transform the idea of mutually reinforcinginstitutions into reality. In the meantime  the internationalcommunity may have acquired a reliable mechanism forthe solution of its acute problems.I believe that the experience of the peace settlementin the former Yugoslavia could serve as a shiningexample for the common elaboration of a future globalsecurity architecture by all Members of this worldOrganization. This architecture should also contain acomprehensive concept of peace-keeping  the elaborationof which  within the framework of the General Assembly has to be accelerated. An essential element in this workcould be the eventual reorientation of peace-keepingtowards preventive diplomacy.However  it is obvious that we will not be able tobuild up a new global security architecture without radicalreform of the United Nations itself. The need for UnitedNations reform was emphasized by virtually allparticipants at the last session of the General Assembly.This issue is also a matter of discussion at the current10session. Yet real changes can be achieved only on thecondition of a substantial revision of the existing financialsystem of the United Nations.ln recent years the United Nations has beenexperiencing an unprecedented financial crisis which posesa real threat to its very functioning. Experience shows thatfinancial crises are the result either of a wrong taxationpolicy or of unsound spending. We think that in the case ofthe United Nations both factors are involved. The inabilityof a number of Member States to meet their financialobligations is a direct consequence of the overassessment oftheir contribution rates. It will be impossible for the UnitedNations to avert financial crisis unless existing irregularitiesin the scale of apportionment of its expenses are eliminated.And we expect that the current session will find a propersolution to this problem.Against its will  Ukraine has been made one of theUnited Nations debtors. This has occurred due to the factthat the decision on the relocation of my country to group(c) in the scale for the financing of peace-keepingoperations has been delayed for several years. Theaccumulation of a substantial debt is a direct result of theGeneral Assembly’s unfair decision 47/456  whose sponsorswere perfectly well aware that the decision would lead tothe current financial crisis. They refused to increase thecontribution of those nations which could afford to pay and contrary to the rules  placed larger assessments on theshoulders of the countries which were unable to pay suchamounts.Ukraine has always been aware of the need to providethe United Nations with adequate financial resources. Uponthe instructions of my Government  I would like to informmembers that Ukraine will start paying off its debt to theUnited Nations. As early as this year  the amount will bereduced by $20 million. In coming years  its real paymentsto the Organization’s budget will be increased.The reform of the Security Council should becomeanother important component of transformation within theUnited Nations. We support the desire of Germany andJapan to acquire the status of permanent members of theSecurity Council  but at the same time stand for increasingthe number of non-permanent members on the basis ofequitable geographical representation  which would alsotake into account the interests of the Eastern Europeanregional group. I hope that the “two plus eight” formulawhich was proposed by Ukraine and which  in principle coincides with the Italian approach and that of othercountries  will be conducive to the achievement of amutually acceptable solution to the problem within theframework of the relevant Working Group of the GeneralAssembly.One of the essential features of general peace andsecurity in the next millennium should be qualitativelynew international economic cooperation  the globalizationof production and trade  the development of science andtechnology and the broadening of the flows of financesand services.We believe that the attention of the worldcommunity should focus today on more than the politicaland military aspects of security. It must also encompassthe economic  social and ecological dimensions of peaceand sustainable development. For Ukraine  this is not justan abstract idea without a fixed deadline for itsimplementation. Chernobyl turned the ecologicaldimension of our national security into a priority ofUkrainian domestic and foreign policy.Ten years have passed since that catastrophe  but weare still experiencing its grave consequences. Chernobylhas not disappeared into the past. If humankind continuesto ignore common sense and to think only about today Chernobyl may be a reflection of our future.We are encouraged by the Secretary-General’s reporton the work of the Organization (A/51/1) stating that theUnited Nations remains deeply concerned by theconsequences of Chernobyl and is committed to pursuingmeasures aimed at their alleviation. We hope that theinternational community will continue to createconditions  including material and financial ones  whichwould allow Ukraine to meet its obligation and todecommission the Chernobyl nuclear power plant by theyear 2000.We should also remember that durable peace andsustainable development on a global scale cannot beachieved unless all countries secure adequate livingstandards for their populations and overcomeunemployment  poverty  social disintegration andenvironmental pollution.In this context  I would like to draw attention to theinitiative concerning the creation of the Council onEconomic Security put forward by the President ofUkraine at the Special Commemorative Meeting of theGeneral Assembly last year. In our view  it is high timeto concentrate the efforts of United Nations MemberStates on the formation of a legal basis which would11allow us to implement this important initiative as one of thesteps towards increasing the level of international economicsecurity  securing the global coordination of the activitiesof international  regional and national economic institutionsand preventing economic coercion and discrimination.The issues of international terrorism  organized crime illicit trafficking of drugs and money laundering havebecome matters of special concern. Ukraine has alwaysplayed an active role in international efforts  particularlywithin the framework of the United Nations  aimed ateliminating these scourges of the present  which not onlythreaten the security and the health of people but have anegative impact on the social  economic and politicalsituation in many countries. We believe that specialattention should be paid to the elaboration of specificactions to be taken against transnational organized crime. Inthis context  Poland’s initiative to place on the agenda ofthe current session the question of the possible elaborationof a convention on those issues is more than timely andshould be supported. Ukraine is ready to participate in thedrafting of this legal instrument.In view of the present financial situation of theOrganization  the search for new ways to revitalizeinternational cooperation in the field of development hasacquired new significance. One of the promising trends primarily in finding additional sources of financing  is thepromotion of regular dialogue between the United Nationsand the financial institution of the Bretton Woods system.We are convinced that larger resources allocated bythese institutions for development would speed up socialand economic transformations both in economies intransition and in developing countries. They would alsocreate conditions for the successful reform of the globalsystem of international economic relations. It is quiteobvious that the integration of those countries into theworld economic system would benefit the entire globalcommunity. We believe that this very philosophy shouldbecome a foundation for a new strategy of global economicdevelopment. The United Nations is called upon to play adecisive role in its elaboration.In this context  we welcome the gradual deepening ofunderstanding among Member States of the problems facedby the countries with economies in transition  as is shownby the increased resources allocated by the United NationsDevelopment Programme for its operational activities in thecountries of Eastern Europe  including Ukraine. For its part Ukraine is considering becoming a full member of themultilateral General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade/WorldTrade Organization system as an integral part of its owneconomic reform.The successes of the United Nations depend uponthe stable development of each Member State. Steadilyovercoming the obstacles that befell our State in theprocess of radically transforming its society  Ukraine hasrecently marked the fifth anniversary of its independence.From this rostrum I would like to reaffirm that the choiceof the Ukrainian people in favour of independentdemocratic development is final and irreversible.The adoption on 28 June of this year of theConstitution of Ukraine has become an event of historicimportance for the Ukrainian people. As President LeonidKuchma emphasized “It is an event of a great significance belonging tothose few historical dates which unite people not bythe iron fist but by the imperatives of the heart  andwhich turn a population into a nation and a territoryinto a State.”In adopting its fundamental law  Ukraine has chosenits own model of State-building and for reformatting itspublic life. In drafting the law  Ukrainian legislatorsbenefited not only from previous historical experiences —such as that provided by Pylyp Orlyk  a famousseventeenth-century Ukrainian public figure who wroteone of the first European democratic constitutions — butalso drew upon the modern experience  in particular thatof the members of the Council of Europe.We in Ukraine are consistently building a sovereign independent  democratic and socially-oriented State whichpromotes human rights as the highest social value. Underextremely difficult circumstances  we have managed tofollow the European model of public life.I would like to emphasize that integration intoEuropean and Euro-Atlantic structures is a strategic goalof Ukraine. At the same time my country is stillcommitted to non-bloc status. Having yesterday becomean observer in the Non-Aligned Movement  Ukraine onceagain proved this.No less important for us remain relations with thenewly independent States of the former Soviet Union notably with the Russian Federation  to which we arelinked by common historical experiences.12Transformations initiated by the market reform of theeconomy are becoming increasingly perceptible in Ukraine.The recent introduction of a new currency  the hryvnya proves conclusively that the radical economic changes inUkraine have become irreversible. The first results ofmonetary reform show that in addition to a positive impacton business activities  it has had a stabilizing psychologicaleffect on the Ukrainian people.Our society is in the process of formation. We realizethat ours is a long and difficult path. There are a number ofimportant objectives we have to achieve. This will requirethe gradual revival of democratic standards and theirintroduction into the fabric of Ukrainian society  which hasbeen scarred by the totalitarian policies of the last decades.While advancing along this road  Ukraine willcontinue to count on the support of the internationalcommunity. At the same time  I would like to reaffirm thatUkraine will continue to be committed to supporting theUnited Nations which  like my own country  is experiencinga difficult but vital time of transformation. This is theimperative of our times  and we have to meet thischallenge."
"170",7200,"URY",51,1996,"﻿Perhaps the term “globalization”  which occurs sofrequently in so many decisions nowadays  best describesthe international system which prevails in the presentdecade and which  under the influence of a growing andclose interdependence  will extend into the twenty-firstcentury. Admittedly  the term is not a precise one thatsums up the broad and complex range of supranationalphenomena that have been emerging since 1989  the yearthat symbolizes the end of the cold war.It is undoubtedly a term that is indicative of the factthat today the cause-and-effect relationship in theeconomic  political and even the cultural spheretranscends traditional national borders more than ever.Interdependence is today more pronounced than everbefore in history: markets  capital flows  research andproduction do not coincide with the political map. Theindustrial assembly lines of advanced technology ignorenational borders  often making it difficult to determine theorigin of a finished product  since its components comefrom such diverse sources. The political boundaries ofStates are no longer boundaries of economic productionand processes. The network of multinational corporationshas expanded to the extent that transactions between theirsubsidiaries account for one quarter of world trade. In theface of the fluctuation and volatility of internationalelectronic transactions  the central banks of the mostdeveloped countries already have difficulty controlling theexchange rates of their currencies or the level of interestrates. The recent establishment of the World TradeOrganization (WTO) is seen as the institutionalculmination of this global trend towards liberalization oftrade in goods and services and as a force conducive tointerdependence.Accordingly  globalization  despite the various ratesat which it operates in different parts of the world —from the slow  deliberate pace at which it proceeds incountries with agrarian economies to the dizzying rapidityof its progress in those possessing advancedtechnologies — appears to be the distinguishing mark of4the post-cold-war era. This phenomenon increasingly lendsitself to the dominance of a system of echoes andreflections between nations  of all manner ofinterrelationships  which in theory should contribute tointernational stability  since according to classical doctrine the risks of military confrontation are reduced when nationsbecome more interdependent economically and financially.Nevertheless  recent events have revealed the contrary: newsources of tension and conflict have emerged on theinternational scene  as well as new unconventional forms ofviolence and crime that affect world peace and destabilizecoexistence within and between democratic societies.In this setting of globalization and interdependence the United Nations — with its universal composition  itsagglutinative structure that brings together countries at themost varied levels of human development and ethnic orreligious composition  its institutional capacity to act as apoint of articulation or a sounding board for all concerns oraspirations that extend beyond the local  national orregional level — would be in an ideal position to play aleading and decisive role. In other words  this Organizationis the forum that  by the nature and magnitude of itsmissions  should embody or interpret more faithfully thanany other institution these compelling  topical phenomenaof globalization and interdependence.Yet  this distinctive role of the United Nations remainsan unrealized vision. It must be asked  then  whether theUnited Nations  an organic manifestation of the globalsystem that has taken shape in this decade  is capable ofeffective  systematic action in preventive diplomacy. Wewould take it one step further and ask what our ownnational responsibility is  as a democratic State and afounding Member of the United Nations  in strengtheningits role in the face of new challenges.Although this may appear simplistic  it is possible toconceive of war as a consequence of poverty  injustice overpopulation or poverty. But if these conditions have tobe eliminated before peace is feasible  then preventing orrestricting hostile tensions becomes a Utopian exercise. Forthis reason  we believe that there is an urgent need to takean up-to-date  modern look at how the United Nationsshould react and act in response to the new threats to peace and at what its capacity should be to respond to thephenomena inherent in the recent or current forms ofglobalization.On considering these questions  we shall certainlycome up against an unavoidable obstacle: that of the nationin its traditional form and as the basic unit on which thestructure of the United Nations was built. This nation nolonger exercises a monopoly over international decisions and consequently is not the exclusive determinant of theirlegitimacy. To some extent  this phenomenon may besimilar to that described as the emergence of theimprecise State  found in a wide variety of non-Statepolitical bodies or agents that have an international impactthrough the intricate network of non-governmentalorganizations and multinational political movementswhose proliferation is another sign of the newinterdependence  and which play an increasingly activerole in the management of the world system.Undoubtedly  Governments  as the executives of thepolitical decisions of States  retain their essential powersin matters of diplomacy  security  defence macroeconomics and currency. Obviously  the UnitedNations  sustained by the will of Governments  has actedand continues to act as a summarizer or synthesizer ofthose various wills  without prejudice to the greater orlesser influence of the military or financial powers of itsMember States. For this reason  quite naturally  theactivity or inactivity of the Organization depends on theconcerns or indifference of national Governments  or onthe way in which those Governments articulate theirconsensus or disagreement. But other actors have alsotaken the international stage  and they are not always apart of the multiplicity of non-governmental organizations.There are also ethnic groups not assimilated into anexternally imposed nationality  so-called region-States with growing links to the world economy and decreasinglinks to national authorities  as well as religiousmovements that transcend frontiers and inflame fanaticismwhich  in some cases  has terrorist effects.We therefore see a dual and contradictory process:globalization and fragmentation. On the one hand interdependence has given rise to an increasinglyinterlinked world in which entities influence each othermutually  and this in theory would be conducive to thestrengthening of political units and the formation ofmega-States or large regional blocs. On the other hand and as a consequence of the progressive impact of thesenew actors on the international scene  fragmentation hasalso emerged. Since its establishment  the United Nationshas seen the number of Member States increase almostfivefold  and at present  approximately one third of thesecountries has been significantly affected by insurgent ordissident movements or Governments in exile.For all of these reasons  which are associated withthis dialectical process of globalization and fragmentation 5with the growing international importance of aheterogeneous collection of new actors and with theemergence of non-conventional threats to peace that cannotbe reconciled through traditional mechanisms of collectivesecurity  we need to rethink our Organization and to act inconsequence.The restructuring of the United Nations is certainly nota new issue. On its thirtieth  fortieth and fiftiethanniversaries  efforts at revision  or rather at reform emerged  aimed at achieving greater efficiency in thepursuit of its purposes. Unfortunately  however  the effortcurrently under way  like its predecessors  does not go tothe root of the problem  which lies far deeper than thepursuit of administrative efficiency or the rationalization offunctions. If we evaluate the current efforts to restructurethe United Nations  we see clearly that in practice virtuallyall of the reforms being studied have no more than aprocedural or formal impact  and do not make a decisivecontribution to strengthening the system  or at least itssubstance  especially if we bear in mind that thisOrganization exists at a period in history characterized mostdistinctly by an accelerated pace of change.Uruguay fully and spontaneously agrees with thewidespread aspiration for change. Like the vast majority ofStates represented here  our country feels a deep-seated natural inclination in favour of any means or instrumentthat  at the global or regional level  prompts or compelsnations to conduct themselves in accordance with law. Forcountries such as ours  which are founded on the rule ofinternational law  it is essential to support any effort toguarantee the legal order  the principles of law  and the ruleof law in relations among States. This is not simply arhetorical reaffirmation of our desire for peace or ourconviction that international law must prevail.Uruguay truly takes the principles of the Charter andthe purposes of this Organization as its own  from themaintenance of peace and security — reflected in the factthat our country contributes the largest number of troopsper capita to international peacekeeping operations — to therecognition of the primacy of international law — reflectedin our being the first country to unconditionally accept thecompulsory jurisdiction of the International Court ofJustice. Our position with regard to the United Nations isthus consistent with our historical definition of ourselves asa nation  a definition anchored in respect for internationalcommitments and strict compliance with the principles ofinternational law in all areas in which States bearresponsibility.With reference to the agenda for the present session and without prejudice to the statements the delegation ofUruguay will be making in the various bodies of theAssembly  we believe it appropriate to make a few briefcomments on some items of particular interest.It is clear that the reform of the Security Council hascaptured the attention of the international community precisely because of the post-cold-war changes I havementioned. The potential impact of the Council on theevaluation  prevention or easing of international conflicts and the effective application of the principle of legalequality among States make it necessary to have greaterdemocratization or transparency in the decision-makingprocess and more equitable geographical distribution inthe composition of the Council.Uruguay has already expressed its support forincreasing the number of permanent members on theCouncil in the light of present-day world realities  but thenumber of non-permanent members should also beincreased  precisely because of the need for greatertransparency and greater representativeness. While manyproposals for change have been put forward  we should atthe very least all agree that the Council’s futurecomposition should be designed so that the quest for morerepresentativeness does not adversely affect the Council’soperational efficiency.With regard to the question of Palestine and thesituation in the Middle East  and despite the variousobstacles that continue to hamper the consolidation of abroad and stable peace  it is essential that the internationalcommunity maintain its support for the peace processinitiated in Madrid in 1991. In the same spirit  it shouldcontinue to encourage direct talks between Israel  thePalestinian Authority and the Arab countries — as isoccurring even today in the United States — with a viewto achieving mutual recognition and the ultimate objectiveof a lasting peace throughout the Middle East. We areconfident that the talks taking place in Washington willculminate in the success to which we all aspire  and towhich they seem to be leading.In another context  integration processes areindispensable for fair competition in a world ofsubregional blocks. In this regard  the countries of theSouthern Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR) areconvinced that our integration process contributes to atrue liberalization of trade. MERCOSUR constitutes anintegrated  open process that has created economic zonesboth inside and outside the subregion. Thus  impetus has6been given to association with other States of thehemisphere  with other regional blocs and with countriesoutside the region. But above all  MERCOSUR hasgenerated trade  both inside and outside the organization.MERCOSUR is today a demonstration of open regionalism which affirms the commitments and  above all  theteachings of the World Trade Organization.There is no question that free trade has been andremains one of the cornerstones of world economicdevelopment  as was repeatedly recognized during theUruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs andTrade (GATT). For this very reason  we cannot endorseunilateral efforts to effect the extraterritorial application ofdomestic legislation and as a consequence of which whether by virtue of their letter or their spirit  a countrywould be able to extend the applicability of its laws beyondits own national borders  undermining not only the principleof non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States butalso freedom of trade  which is the very essence of theWorld Trade Organization  recently established by theinternational community.While our hopes for the establishment ofrepresentative democracy throughout our continent remainas strong as ever  we continue to oppose the unilateralapplication of economic  trade or financial measures againsta State for political purposes. The usefulness of suchmeasures for the rapid and peaceful transition of a countrytowards democracy has not yet been demonstrated.With regard to cooperation for development  we recallthat the countries with greater capacities to contributeundertook to allocate at least 0.7 per cent of their grossdomestic product for that purpose. Yet there has been asignificant downward trend in contributions stemming fromthat commitment in recent years  and this trend cannot belinked to the financial crisis the Organization isexperiencing. These are resources intended to fight povertyand underdevelopment and to create more dignified livingconditions for our peoples. Nor should we confinecooperation to a vertical  one-way process; rather  we mustalso view it in terms of South-South cooperation  availingourselves of our mutual experience to create our owncompetitive advantages.A few days ago  Uruguay became one of the firstsignatories to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.Together with other developments  such as the AdvisoryOpinion of the International Court of Justice regarding thelegality of the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons  thisTreaty constitutes a basic instrument for the reaffirmationof the principles of international peace and security.Still in the field of disarmament  we have repeatedlyvoiced our opposition to the transfer  stockpiling  exportand production of anti-personnel landmines. Accordingly we shall continue to support keenly all initiatives aimedat eliminating them  as well as at securing the immediateentry into force of the Protocol adopted in Vienna lastMay. Uruguayan contingents assigned to peacekeepingMissions in Angola  Mozambique and Western Saharahave been among the many victims of these weapons  andit is the moral obligation of humankind to eradicate them.Finally  we should like to close by referring to oneof the clearest and most tangible manifestations of thephenomenon of globalization we have sought to describe:the production  trafficking and consumption of illegaldrugs. This is one of the most tragic forms ofinternational organized crime  and its growing seriousnessis demonstrated by statistics from the most varied sources.Its transnational nature makes it essential that theprinciple of shared responsibility should be systematicallyapplied — without exception or unilateralism — to theentire cycle of production  trafficking and consumption.This is a tightly wound chain whose links include allcountries without exception.Please accept  Mr. President  our sincerestcongratulations on your election to guide the work of theAssembly and the firmest commitment of the Governmentof the Eastern Republic of Uruguay to support you inyour activities."
"171",7247,"USA",51,1996,"﻿Three years ago I had the honourof being the first American President born after thefounding of the United Nations to address the GeneralAssembly. In its fifty-first year  the United Nations has notyet realized all its founders’ aspirations. But the ideals ofthe United Nations Charter — peace  freedom  toleranceand prosperity — now touch more people in more nationsthan ever before.Now we find ourselves at a turning point in historywhen the blocs and barriers that long defined the world aregiving way to an age of remarkable possibility — a timewhen more of our children and more nations will be able tolive out their dreams than ever before. But this is also anage of new threats — threats from terrorists  from rogueStates that support them  threats from ethnic  religious racial and tribal hatreds  threats from internationalcriminals and drug traffickers — all of whom will bemore dangerous if they gain access to weapons of massdestruction.The challenge before us  plainly  is twofold: to seizethe new opportunities for more people to enjoy peace andfreedom  security and prosperity and to move stronglyand swiftly against the dangers that change has produced.This week and in this place  we take a giant stepforward. By overwhelming global consensus  we willmake a solemn commitment to end all nuclear tests for alltime.Before entering this Hall  I had the great honour tobe the first leader to sign the Comprehensive Test-BanTreaty (CTBT). I did so  with some pride  with this pen for this pen is the very one that President Kennedy usedto help bring the limited test-ban Treaty to life 33 yearsago.This Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty will helpprevent the nuclear Powers from developing moreadvanced and more dangerous weapons. It will limit theability of other States to acquire such devices themselves.It points us towards a century in which the roles and risksof nuclear weapons can be further reduced and ultimatelyeliminated.I want to thank all those who helped bring us to thisday  especially the Chairman of the comprehensive test-ban negotiating Committee  Netherlands AmbassadorRamaker  and the Government of Australia  which took thelead at the United Nations.I thank the Secretary-General for the remarks he madethis morning in establishing the criteria and standards insupport of the United Nations as the depository of theTreaty.The signatures of the world’s declared nuclearPowers — the United States  China  France  Russia and theUnited Kingdom — along with those of the vast majorityof its nations  will immediately create an international normagainst nuclear testing even before the Treaty formallyenters into force.The CTBT is the shared work of hard negotiation.Some have complained that it does not mandate totalnuclear disarmament by a date certain. I would say to them:“Do not forsake the benefits of this achievement byignoring the tremendous progress we have already madetowards that goal.” Today there are no Russian missilespointed at America and no American missiles pointed atRussia.Through the START Treaties we are cutting ournuclear arsenals by two thirds. Ukraine  Belarus andKazakstan are giving up the nuclear weapons left on theirland after the Soviet Union dissolved.We are working with the newly independent States toimprove security at nuclear facilities and to convert nuclearweapons to peaceful uses.The United States and other nuclear-weapon Stateshave embraced the South Pacific and African nuclear-freezones. Now half the world’s land area is nuclear free byinternational agreement. And the world communityextended indefinitely the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation ofNuclear Weapons (NPT).Yet some of the very changes that had made thisprogress possible have also created new risks. The breakupof the Soviet Union left nuclear materials dispersedthroughout the newly independent States. As barriers havecome down around the world the danger of nuclearsmuggling has gone up. So even as we reduce the globalstockpiles of weapons of mass destruction  we must alsoreduce the danger that lethal materials could wind up in thewrong hands  while developing effective defences for ourpeople if that should happen.The United States has six priority goals to further liftthe threat of nuclear weapons destruction and the threat ofweapons of mass destruction  and to limit their dangerousspread.First  we must protect our people from chemicalattack and make it harder for rogue States and terroriststo brandish poison gas by bringing the chemical weaponsConvention into force as soon as possible. I thank thenations here that have ratified the chemical weaponsConvention. I deeply regret that the United States Senatehas not yet voted on the Convention  but I want to assureyou and people throughout the world that I will not letthis treaty die  and we will join the ranks of nationdetermined to prevent the spread of chemical weapons.Secondly  we must reduce the risk that an outlawState or organization could build a nuclear device bynegotiating a treaty to freeze the production of fissilematerials for use in nuclear weapons. The Conference onDisarmament should take up this challenge immediately.The United States  Russia  France and the UnitedKingdom already have halted production of fissilematerials for weapons. I urge other nations to end theunsafeguarded production of these materials pendingcompletion of the treaty.Thirdly  we must continue to reduce our nucleararsenals. When Russia ratifies START II  PresidentYeltsin and I are all ready to discuss the possibilities offurther cuts  as well as limiting and monitoring nuclearwarheads and materials. This will help make deepreductions irreversible.Fourthly  we must reinforce our efforts against thespread of nuclear weapons by strengthening the Treaty onthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). Weshould give the International Atomic Energy Agency astronger role and sharper tools for conducting worldwideinspections. Our law enforcement and customs officialsshould cooperate more in the fight against nuclearsmuggling. And I urge all nations that have not signed theNPT to do so without delay.Fifthly  we must better protect our people from thosewho would use disease as a weapon of war  by giving thebiological weapons Convention the means to strengthencompliance  including on-site investigations when webelieve such weapons may have been used or whensuspicious outbreaks of disease occur. We should aim tocomplete this task by 1998.2Finally  we must end the carnage caused byanti-personnel landmines  the hidden killers that murder andmaim more than 25 000 people a year. In May  I announceda series of actions the United States would take towardsthis goal. Today  I renew my appeal for the swiftnegotiation of a worldwide ban on the use  stockpiling production  and transfer of anti-personnel landmines. Ourchildren deserve to walk the Earth in safety.Thirty-three years ago  at the height of the cold war President Kennedy spoke at American University inWashington. Peace was the topic of his address  but not anabstract ideal of peace. Instead  he urged us to focus on“a more practical  attainable peace — based not on asudden revolution in human nature but on a gradualevolution in human institutions — on a series ofconcrete actions and effective agreements which are inthe interests of all concerned.”It was in that same speech that he announced that talkswould shortly begin in Moscow on a comprehensive test-ban treaty.President Kennedy’s vision exceeded the possibilitiesof his time  but his words speak to us still. As we sign ournames to the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty —the longest-sought  hardest-fought prize in arms controlhistory — let us summon the confidence of earlier pioneersand set our sights on the challenges of the new century.Over the past three years we have moved in the rightdirection in meeting those challenges. In Bosnia  where thewar is over and where just 10 days ago its people went tothe polls in peace  we have moved in the right direction.Now we must help Bosnia build a unified  democratic  andpeaceful future.In Haiti  where the dictators are gone  democracy isback and the exodus of refugees has ended  we have movein the right direction. Now we must help the Haitian peopleseize the full benefits of freedom and forge a moreprosperous future. In the Middle East and in NorthernIreland  there is progress towards lasting peace  and we aremoving in the right direction. Now we must supportcontinued progress between Israel and Palestinians  and wemust broaden the circle of peace to include more of Israel’sneighbours. We must help to give the children of Belfastthe chance to live out normal lives.In the fact that democracy  open markets and peaceare taking hold around the world  we are moving in theright direction. Here in the Americas  every nation butone has raised freedom’s flag. In Central Europe  inRussia  Ukraine and the other new independent States  theforces of reform have earned all our respect and willcontinue to have the support of the United States. Nowwe must begin to welcome Europe’s new democraciesinto the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) strengthen NATO’s partnership with Russia and build asecure and undivided Europe.In Asia  South Korea  Japan  China and Americaworking together persuaded North Korea to freeze itsnuclear programme under international monitoring. Now in the wake of provocative actions by North Korea  wemust pursue a permanent peace for all the Korean people.Our planet is safer because of our common efforts toclose Chernobyl  to address the challenges of climatechange  to protect the world’s forests and oceans. Nowwe must uphold our duty as custodians of ourenvironment so that our children will inherit an evenhealthier planet.All of us must continue our historic efforts to builda better  more global trading system for the twenty-firstcentury. We have made remarkable progress  but there ismore to do in opening markets  in creating millions ofnew jobs for all our people.In this time of challenge and change  the UnitedNations is more important than ever before  because ourworld is more interdependent than ever before. MostAmericans know this. Unfortunately  some Americans  intheir longing to be free of the world’s problems  andperhaps to focus more on our own problems  ignore whatthe United Nations has done  ignore the benefits ofcooperation. They ignore our own interdependence withall of you in charting a better future. They ignore all thatthe United Nations is doing to lift the lives of millions bypreserving the peace  vaccinating children  caring forrefugees  sharing the blessings of progress around theworld. They have made it difficult for the United Statesto meet its obligations to the United Nations. But let mereassure all of you: the vast majority of Americanssupport the United Nations  not only because it reflectsour own ideals  but because it reinforces our interests. Wemust continue to work to manifest the support that ourpeople feel. For the fifty-first year in a row  the UnitedStates will be the largest financial contributor to theUnited Nations. We are paying our dues  and I amcommitted to paying off our accumulated obligations.However  we also support the process of reform  whichhas done great work in reforming and streamlining the3bureaucracy and reining in the budget  and it shouldcontinue.We also believe that all of us — the nations of theworld working together — must do more to fight terrorism.Last year I asked the nations assembled here to commit toa goal of zero tolerance for aggression  terrorism andlawless behaviour. Frankly  we have not done that yet. Realzero tolerance means giving no aid and no quarter toterrorists who slaughter the innocent and drug traffickerswho poison our children  and doing everything we can toprevent weapons of mass destruction from falling into thewrong hands. Real zero tolerance requires us to isolateStates that refuse to play by the rules we have all acceptedfor civilized behaviour. As long as Iraq threatens itsneighbours and its people  as long as Iran supports andprotects terrorists  as long as Libya refuses to give up thepeople who blew up Pan Am 103  they should not becomefull members of the family of nations.The United States is pursuing a three-part strategyagainst terrorists: abroad  by working more closely thanever with like-minded nations; at home by giving our lawenforcement the toughest counter-terrorism tools available and by doing all we can to make our airports and theaeroplanes that link us all together even safer. I haverequested more than $1 billion from our Congress to meetthese commitments  and we are implementing the UnitedStates Vice President's aviation security plan to make thosetravelling to  from and within the United States moresecure.There are other steps we must take together. Last year I urged that together we crack down on money launderingand front companies  shut down gray markets for guns explosives and false documents  open more lawenforcement centres around the world and strengthensafeguards on lethal materials. In each of these areas wehave made progress  through the United Nations  at theSummit of Peacemakers in Sharm el-Sheikh  at the Paristerrorism conference and individually.Now we should adopt the declaration on crime andpublic security I proposed last year. It includes a no-sanctuary pledge  so that we can say with one voice to theterrorists  criminals and drug traffickers: “You have noplace to run  no place to hide.” I call on every Member toratify 11 international conventions that would help preventand punish terrorism and to criminalize the use ofexplosives in terrorist attacks.To every nation whose children fall prey todrugs and every nation that makes those drugs: we mustdo more to reduce demand and to take illegal drugs offthe market and off the streets. The United States will doits part. Next week  I will target more than $100-millionworth of defence equipment  services and training toMexico  Colombia and other South American andCaribbean countries.These resources will help our friends stop the flowof drugs at the source. Now I ask every nation thatexports the chemicals needed to make illicit drugs tocreate an informal group whose members will work todeny these chemicals to drug producers. We must not letmore drugs darken the dawn of the next century.Our duty to fight all these forces of destruction isdirectly linked to our efforts to reduce the threat ofweapons of mass destruction. We all know we are notimmune from this. We saw it when our friends in Japanwere subject to the murderous power of a small vial ofsarin gas unleashed in the Tokyo subway. We know asmall lump of plutonium is enough to build a nuclearbomb. We know that more dangerous people have accessto materials of mass destruction because of the rapidmovement and open borders of this age. The quest toeliminate these problems from the world’s arsenals and tostop them from spreading has taken on a new andpowerful urgency for all of us.So let us strengthen our determination to fight therogue States  the terrorists and the criminals who menaceour safety  our way of life and the potential of ourchildren in the twenty-first century. Let us recommitourselves to prevent them from acquiring weapons ofmass destruction. Let us work harder than ever to lift thenuclear backdrop that has darkened the world’s stage fortoo long now. Let us make these solemn tasks ourcommon obligation  our common commitment; if we do then together we will enter the twenty-first centurymarching towards a better  safer world — the very better safer world the United Nations has sought to build for 51years."
"172",7271,"UZB",51,1996,"﻿Let me express my appreciation for the honourof addressing the Assembly. On behalf of the Governmentand people of the Republic of Uzbekistan  I offer mysincerest congratulations to Ambassador Razali Ismail ofMalaysia on his election as President of the fifty-firstsession of the General Assembly. I am sure that hispresidency will enable us successfully to solve many ofthe urgent issues on the international agenda. I also take16this opportunity to extend our appreciation and gratitude toMr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral  President of the historicfiftieth session of the General Assembly  for his valuableguidance and personal involvement in the resolution ofissues the world was facing during that period.We consider the safeguarding of peace and stability inCentral Asia and the sustainable development of the regionas the most important goal of our cooperation with theUnited Nations and its specialized agencies. In this context I would like to outline a number of problems and to makeseveral proposals.First  regarding regional security  we are of the viewthat we need to move through regionalism towards theglobal: global peace can be achieved through stability in thevarious regions of the world. Regional conflicts areincreasingly the direct source of such dangerous challengesand threats as terrorism and violence  the illicit arms tradeand drugs trafficking. That is why the main focus ofUzbekistan’s initiatives aimed at ensuring security in theCentral Asian region is finding ways to settle the conflictin Afghanistan and to stabilize the situation in Tajikistan.One of the most important elements of these initiativesis an embargo on arms deliveries to Afghanistan. Wewelcome the start of a discussion of this problem in theSecurity Council and support proposals for a comprehensiveapproach and for the convening of an internationalconference — where  in our view  the main role should beplayed by the United Nations. Halting arms deliveries toAfghanistan is an indispensable condition for any peaceprocess. An embargo does not mean just any sanctionsagainst Afghanistan; it has to be directed towards those whocontinue to supply weapons to the area of conflict. Theinability of Afghanistan’s forces to control its bordersrequires efforts on the part of the international communityto ensure that arms deliveries are ended.I would like to underline particularly that the Republicof Uzbekistan  more than any other nation in the world seeks to return to age-old traditional relations of friendship cooperation and mutual trust with neighbouringAfghanistan. This is the only aim guiding us in ourinitiatives to promote peace in the Islamic State ofAfghanistan. We want Afghanistan to be a stable indivisible State  open to the outside world for the sake ofprogress and prosperity. I take this opportunity to appealonce again to the Secretary-General  and to the Presidentsof the Security Council and the General Assembly to dotheir utmost to resolve the Afghan conflict  which poses aserious threat not only to regional security but also to forglobal security.We continue to believe that Central Asia has its owncharacteristics; the positive or negative development ofevents there can be a catalyst for positive changes or adestructive factor affecting the situation far beyond theregion.Secondly  we must enter the twenty-first centurywith a new vision of questions of peace and security in arapidly changing world. The promotion of world peace isaccompanied today by intensive debates and disputes onthe expansion of the membership of various internationalbodies and on models for comprehensive world securityin the twenty-first century.While welcoming these aspirations  we must notethat each sovereign country in this multi-polar world hasthe right to decide for itself  in accordance with itsnational interests  and with its regional identity taken intoconsideration  whether or not to enter a given union irrespective of the position of more powerful countries.There is no place for domination or monopoly on the partof other  more powerful  countries in resolving thisproblem.Thirdly  as regards our position in relation to theCommonwealth of Independent States (CIS)  we considerthat the CIS countries can successfully cooperate withinthe framework of the Commonwealth on a multilateraland bilateral basis. At the same time  we believe that theCIS cannot be treated as a unit under international law. Itis unacceptable to let the CIS be transformed into apolitical or indeed a military-political bloc. Otherwise  theworld community will inevitably slide back down intoglobal antagonisms and confrontation. For Uzbekistan this is fundamentally unacceptable.Fourthly  Uzbekistan continues to support thecomplete elimination of nuclear weapons and views ashistoric the decision to conclude the ComprehensiveNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty  adopted under the auspices ofthe United Nations  and the beginning of the signatureprocess of the Treaty. We consider this event to be amost important stage in liberating humanity from thethreat of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.For our part  the relevant work is being carried outto establish a nuclear-free zone in Central Asia within theinternational non-proliferation system. We believe that the17initiative of the President of Uzbekistan will soon find moredetailed interest in the Security Council.Fifthly  I would like once again to draw the attentionof Member States to ecological problems  whosedimensions go beyond State borders. I would especially liketo say a word about the problem of the Aral Sea. Therehave already been a great number of scientific studies andinternational conferences  including several on thesustainable development of the Aral Sea countries.However  to our great disappointment  we do not see anymovement from statements to practical deeds. I would liketo note that Uzbekistan supports and considers as timelyGreat Britain’s proposal on the adoption of a specialdeclaration condemning terrorism in all its forms.For a more effective functioning of United Nationsmachinery in all areas of activity  we consider it necessaryto reform a number of United Nations organs  including theSecurity Council. This is in line with today’s realities. Thegeo-strategic balance of power raises the question of theexpansion of the number of permanent members of theSecurity Council. We are convinced that such States asGermany and Japan today are fully equipped to bepermanent members of the Security Council.Uzbekistan stands for the constructive reform of theUnited Nations. In this context  together with other States including Italy  whose proposals deserve serious attention we express our sincere desire to ensure that the UnitedNations is a reliable instrument for maintaining universalpeace and stability."
"173",7317,"VCT",51,1996,"﻿Lastyear  we celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the UnitedNations with much fanfare and glowing tributes. The organsof this body were dissected and properly examined and thefindings were encouraging. The prevailing opinion is thatthe strengths of this institution far outweigh its weaknesses.However  we cannot be complacent. As our Prime Minister the Right Honourable Sir James Mitchell  said when headdressed the fiftieth session:“Living institutions  like anything biological  need thenurture of fresh nutrients  fresh ideas. A living thingeither improves or perishes.” (Official Records of theGeneral Assembly  Fiftieth Session  Plenary Meetings 40th meeting  p. 49)Mr. Razali has assumed the presidency after the periodof stock-taking and at a time when we look with renewedconfidence towards the United Nations. His passion forinnovation will serve him well. As he presides over this re-energized body  I wish to congratulate him on his electionto the presidency. Let me take this opportunity to extendto his predecessor our best wishes and deep appreciationfor the competent manner in which he presided over thelast historic session.As the twenty-first century approaches  we must askourselves the following questions: What of the future?Will our children survive? Will we be at peace with ourfellow men?The picture looks bleak. We are still plagued bypersistent poverty  disease  hunger  environmentaldegradation and spiritual pollution  wanton acts ofterrorism  the drug menace  domestic disturbances andregional conflicts.There is still hope so long as we see each other asfriends and neighbours rather than as competitors. If wepool our resources for the enhancement of mankind  theworld will be a much better place.We have witnessed over the past year a trail ofterrorist destruction and death. In our view  all terroristsare cowards who rely on fear and destabilization toachieve their sinister ends. What triumph can there be inthe murder and disfiguring of innocent people? This isobviously the product of sick minds. These facelesscriminals who perform these acts  sometimes with thetacit approval of authority  have no place in thecommunity of nations.My delegation is calling for another conference todeal with the root causes of terrorism. Such a conferencemust involve this entire body so that the views of smalland mighty nations on the matter can be expressed. Asthe new century approaches  our children must be able toplay in public parks without having to look over theirshoulders. When we travel  we must be able to view thepassengers next to us as new-found friends rather thanpotential executioners.Why do we continue to stockpile weapons of massdestruction? The aim of these weapons is to kill. Killinghuman beings should not be regarded as a sport. Life willalways be man’s most treasured possession. In ourpeaceful region  we are strangers to the world of suchdeadly arsenals and will continue to denounce their use.We are delighted to be associated with the passage of theAustralian resolution on the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. Any step  however small  towards the curbing14of the arms race and the eventual elimination of weaponsmust be viewed as positive.One of the most formidable challenges of our time isthe protection of the environment. The threats whichconfront us are daunting; global warming  desertificationand deforestation are among the many. Environmentalprotection is the key to our survival. Mankind is faced witha choice: either save the environment or perish.The suffering in Burundi  Somalia  Liberia  Rwandaand Bosnia cannot go unnoticed. The internationalcommunity can do much more to help the dispossessed andthe hungry of these troubled lands. After all  should we notbe our brother’s keeper?I come from a small but proud country. Our peoplebelieve in industry and hard work. The banana industry isthe mainstay of our economy. But our very existence isunder serious threat from forces larger and more powerfulthan ourselves. I speak not in anger  only in pain andhelplessness. How else can we feel when those who havethe capacity to help us seek our destruction? If the forcesof indifference and greed were to succeed  our societywould be thrown out of gear and the democracy which weso cherish will go up in flames.Our entire population has been sensitized to ourbanana woes and the people have vented their frustration bywriting thousands of letters to those who may hold the keyto our survival. We wish to thank all those who have cometo our assistance  be they in Europe or elsewhere  and wesincerely hope that they will continue to lend a helpinghand.Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is deeply concernedabout the use of illegal drugs and drug trafficking. Themagnitude of this problem transcends national boundariesand calls for increased cooperation on a multilateral level.The influence of the drug barons runs very deep.Sometimes they take on the characteristics of power elites.We firmly believe that renewed international efforts can goa long way towards the eradication of this menace  whichcontaminates both body and mind.While we welcome the recent elections in Bosnia  weare troubled by developments in the Persian Gulf. Wesincerely hope that the situation will normalize itself assoon as possible  since an escalation of the crisis would beof benefit to no one.The Middle East is another area of concern. Wehope that the recent peace talks between the Israelis andthe Palestine Liberation Organization will bear fruit.Much has been achieved over the past two decades and itis expected that the next century will bring peace to thetroubled people of these ancient lands.I now turn my attention to the vexing question of theresumed participation of the Republic of China on Taiwanin the United Nations. This founding member of theUnited Nations has been excluded from this body for aquarter of a century. How does one reconcile this with theprinciples of parallel representation of States and ofuniversality? It is time for the Republic of China onTaiwan to be readmitted to this body. In our view  thecountry not only possesses the attributes of nationhood but it is well endowed to contribute to the development ofMember States of this body. Its economic success is amodel for developing countries. The country has alsomade democratic strides. I wish through this forum tocongratulate the Republic of China on Taiwan on theholding of its first direct presidential election. It is reallya triumph of the democratic process. All States have notembraced this process.Despite the adoption and entry into force of theConvention on the Rights of the Child  we are shocked bythe incidence of gross violations of the fundamental rightsof the child. Sexual abuse  prostitution and child labourare but a few of the problems that dehumanize ourchildren. My delegation joins in the call for measures tobe taken  not only for the universal ratification of theConvention  but also for the effective implementation ofthis instrument.There has been much discussion about the reform ofthe Security Council. Brilliant ideas have been putforward from all quarters. Our own view is that theSecurity Council must be restructured to reflect anequitable geographic distribution. After all  big Powers donot have a monopoly on knowledge or truth. And in thisbody  all nations should be treated as equals.History has saddled the United Nations with a heavyburden of responsibility and  as we look towards thetwenty-first century  we must seize every opportunity toachieve the goals and ideals enshrined in the Charter.There is a great deal to be done in the area of social andeconomic development  but we can do it once we havethe political will and the unity of purpose.15"
"174",7364,"VEN",51,1996,"﻿I would like first of all to congratulateAmbassador Razali on his election to the presidency ofthe Assembly and to wish him every success in his work.It would seem that after half a century  the debate onthe meaning  importance  role and timeliness of thisOrganization has become increasingly impassioned. Itcould be said that the United Nations is on trial.It may be that some of the criticism is justified. It isaccused  for instance  of having a large bureaucracy  andit is said that there is a proliferation of situationsrequiring the deployment of military forces to pave thepath for peace  which is also a path riddled with war.These situations came about without the consent of theMember States  who must all bear their share of the costs.This enlarged bureaucracy  added to the expenses ofmilitary peacekeeping  increases the financial burden ofthe weaker countries. Yet  it seems to be the strongcountries that most resent and denounce this burden.Nevertheless  to thoroughly assess and evaluate whatthe United Nations is and what it represents  we wouldhave to compare it to another such organization of itskind  one that had brought together nearly 200 sovereignStates  led them by the hand through 50 of the mostenigmatic and dangerous years of history and remained apoint of reference when all the ideological references hadcollapsed. And that other organization has never existed.As far as we know  humanity has never livedthrough 50 continuous years of peace  yet 51 years havepassed without a tremor of generalized conflict like theones that once seemed to be cyclical. Even thoughmisunderstandings and aggressions appear on onecontinent or another  based on deep-seated racial religious or political hatred  and leading to genocide orlocal wars  we cannot speak of a conflagration  especiallywhen the will of the people of all regions rises abovethese wars  committed to the restoration of peace.The international community  in varying degrees  hasstarted to review its greatest Organization  and it hasfocused its attention first on the Security Council.Fortunately  the creative imagination of States hassuggested various ways to change it in order to make itmore representative of the new world realities and  of13course  to make it more efficient. My country follows thisprocess with enormous interest  aware that the SecurityCouncil will be the centre of balance of the world system.In the meantime  this long period of relative peace hasallowed for the rise of European integration  which isperhaps the greatest political achievement of our century. Ithas made possible the growth of daring and vigoroustechnological civilizations in Asian countries as well asunderstanding and growth in the Latin American region which today has become  thanks to this understanding humankind’s most promising abode. In this framework Venezuela has broadened its ties with and deepened itscommitments to the great causes of our time  such as theenforcement of human rights  truly representativedemocracy  integration as an economic and political cultureof our modern era and disarmament as a guarantee of worldsecurity. Tomorrow  on behalf of my country I shallproudly sign the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.My country hopes that the criticism levelled at theOrganization will justify itself by leading to logical plans toreform and revitalize it. Its success must be definitivelyestablished in the implementation of human rights  in thefight against terrorism and in the alliance to exterminatedrug trafficking and connected activities. A special sessionof the General Assembly has been called on this latter topicat Mexico’s urging.In his current report on the work of the Organization the Secretary-General refers to the territorial controversybetween Venezuela and Guyana. I must note that thiscontroversy lies within the framework of the 1966 Genevaagreement signed by both countries in order to reach apractical and lasting solution to this dispute. In a spirit ofdialogue and cooperation between the two parties  weappealed to the Secretary-General’s good offices and arenow applying one of the mechanisms for the peacefulsettlement of disputes provided for in the United NationsCharter. We are therefore surprised that this case isexpressly mentioned in the chapter on conflict situations.As a Latin American  I must recognize that  thanks tothis lasting peace  my region  a scion of Europe  and itscreature in many respects  has resumed friendly relationswith its natural metropolis after 80 years of world wars thathad separated us and created a rift in the cultural patternsthat had governed us for centuries.Of course  numerous threats linger on. The so-calledweapon-States that have the financial resources to spark aregional conflict that can multiply and spread are still there untouched by democratic norms and mostly driven byfanaticism. In countries where no one would haveimagined it  the danger of racial discrimination returnslike a nightmare. At the very centre of the most culturedcontinent  we have witnessed a war and a genocide thatwe would angrily condemn in Cambodia or in Rwanda and among countries that have been an world example oftolerance and coexistence for centuries. The followers oftwo religions that are virtually the same confront andexterminate one another almost daily.At the same time  the conditions of exchanges  thegoals of good policies and the miracle of moderncommunications lead to a free flow of trade  technology scientific models and human movement  both throughtourism and through commercial interests. All this isbringing humanity together as a whole  using informationto express an impassioned interest that is beginning to bewidely known as globalization.The Organization still has to overcome theprophecies and schemes of pessimistic traditions according to which natural law dictates the existence ofwars  diseases and other disasters as a fateful necessity toregulate population growth and as an incentive to devisetechnologies and scientific developments in the escalationthat Malthusians see in their observation of nature.Peace is the primary purpose of the United Nations;war is the recourse most commonly used by humanity totry to solve imbalances and resentments. And we havepeace  ceaselessly troubled but always re-established asfar as and wherever possible. But we must remember thatwar is the most chronic of recidivists  since greed andambition feed on it.We might say that what this Organization needs tosolve universal strife  poverty and untrammelledpopulation growth is a human resource development andsystematic education project to do away with the fragileethics of our time and to teach all nations the art ofliving — and living together. Fears  suspicions andanimosities are engendered by ignorance among peopleand nations.I speak on behalf of a country whose most importantnatural resource has endowed it with power and economiceuphoria on the one hand  and plunged it into acutepsychological depression on the other. That resource isoil  of which we hold the largest and most secure reservesin the Western world. Since oil legally belongs to theState  as do all underground resources  the State finds it 14processes it  sells it and distributes its revenues as services.Little by little  the old agricultural country became used tostretching out a hand to receive from the State gifts ofprotectionism  subsidies  scholarships  credits and evenundue largesse  all of which used to come from the land asa reward for labour.For more than two generations Venezuelans reliedexclusively on oil  disregarding personal effort. At times the State demagogically encouraged this dependency andpromoted idleness  thus leading to ethical complicationsborn of collusion between politics and the economy. Thisis the deep-seated reason for the so-called Venezuelancrisis. It is different from others because it is not economicbut moral  and can only be solved by a return to honestbehaviour and personal endeavour  which requires a greatdeal of time and effort.This is what the Administration of President RafaelCaldera is striving for. After trying to reverse the enormousevils he inherited  using measures that were not too harmfuleconomically for the weakest sector  on 15 April  hedecided to open up the economy and incorporate prevailingmarket economy values through the Venezuelan Agenda.He was careful  however  to establish a programme toabsorb the enormous shock this opening causestransitionally on the majorities accustomed to the old Statepaternalism. After a brief period  we are emerging from thisunique crisis  which cannot be and could not have beenresolved by a simple decree  as other crises  since itrequired and still requires a change in habits in order forpeople to learn to be self-sufficient. The case of Venezuelacould recur in other countries characterized by Statepaternalism.If we look closely at the so-called social crisis that allLatin American countries suffer  we can see it is due to alack of training. We used to say that education was theuniversal solution to all problems  and it is. But at a timewhen Latin American society has become unhinged becauseof peasant migrations undoing the social and moral order with the ensuing marginalization brought about by a changein customs leading to the degradation of the family  botheducation and training are absolute necessities.The breakdown of the traditional home deprivespeople of the essential ethical values that used to be learnedfrom the mother. Nowadays  the State must replace thehome and the mother  in preparing the inner self of itscitizens. It is evident  therefore  that training and educationare of primary importance since the human being’s innerself must be strengthened in order to rebuild the familyunit  which gives coherence  pride and courage to asociety. Simón Bolívar  the Liberator of America  graspedthe whole problem when he said  “Morality andenlightenment are our first necessities”. Perhaps the wholeworld today suffers the same evil and has the same needs.The United Nations  through its specialized agencies is carrying out innumerable programmes  studies  trialsand experiments to solve the daily tragedy of our humanspecies. This is becoming more and more complex sincethe efforts are aimed at an already deformed being incapable  therefore  of living in harmony with others.If we were to agree that the chain connecting home primary school  secondary school  university  and lifebroke down some time ago  and that it is missing its firstlink  without which all else is pointless and withoutfoundation  we would invest at the very roots of humanlife the economic and scientific resources needed to formhuman beings from the start  enabling them to grow endowed with the values that would make them citizens.Latin America  born unaware of racial hatred religious conflicts and territorial greed  with an indivisiblespirit made up of a combination of influences that movein the same direction on the freest and broadest of stages is hurt by the fact that its real problems today are socialones  brought on by the error of political regimes thatignored the discipline of education or doubted itsundeniable primacy.Democracy has taken root in Latin America as in noother part of the universe as a consequence of politicaldesire. Nevertheless  we are not satisfied  becausedemocracy must mean the eradication of age-old ills andconstitute  more than merely a system to electgovernments  a cogent civilization.We aspire to a democracy transparent in its conductand effective in its achievements to continue offering it asan alternative to the ancient dictatorships. This explainsmy country’s perseverance in attaining an honest andclean democracy. In this regard  we have proposed aconvention against corruption  which has been approvedat the hemispheric level. Strangely enough  it would bethe first of its kind in the world  which goes to show howstrongly entrenched this vice is: it has gone unpunishedby dictatorships and democracies alike throughout timeand around the world.The day is not distant when this instrument  limitednow to our hemisphere  will encompass our whole15Organization  since the crime it prosecutes is notexclusively American but takes root in many countries onall continents. During the last substantive session of theEconomic and Social Council  Venezuela  together withArgentina  the United States and other countries  sponsoreda United Nations declaration on corruption and bribery intransnational commercial activities  which is clear proof thatthe fight against unpunished corruption prospers in theworld.If the United Nations  aware that the key to universalchange lies in training and education  were to inspire andlead an in-depth study of what makes a human being  of theway societies that break into conflict or serve as models forothers are defined by the sum of their members; if theUnited Nations were to use the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) to add auniversal teaching component to all its cooperationprogrammes  then the true ethical and human redemption ofsociety would begin.Free of prejudice and with sufficient resources  LatinAmerica  a melting pot of customs and races  could serveas a laboratory to show how the human species canstraighten its spine of ethics  which has been so twisted inso many places. Our America as a whole is a welcomingplace for peace  since there are no elements of unease orinsecurity other than social asymmetries — not theasymmetries of blood-lines  but those of dire poverty  bornof the incapacity to transform and distribute our plentifulnatural resources.We are living a unique moment in history. In a shorttime  without violence  we have seen great empires come toan end  the elimination of the cruellest jails of humanthought  the liberation of all wills and the opening of thegreatest opportunity peoples have ever had to reorganizethemselves in accordance with hopes and desires that werelong repressed or thwarted by violence of all sorts.As Marguerite Yourcenar says in her biography ofHadrian  referring to the religious perplexity of the greatEmperor: in his lifetime the old gods no longer existed andChrist had not yet arrived. Humanity’s present spirit seemsto be similar: free  but still dazed and hesitant to adopt anew order from a new mould; but  above all  free  althoughat this fateful moment great leaders might be lacking.The United Nations holds and reflects this feeling —hovering between jubilation and disbelief — like a prodigystanding before the panorama of infinite possibilities ofwhat we can create with the fertile dreams of our era."
"175",7403,"VNM",51,1996,"﻿On behalf of the delegation of the SocialistRepublic of Viet Nam  I would like to congratulate youwarmly  Sir  on your election as President of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-first session. We are truly proud thatyou  an experienced representative of Malaysia  a membercountry of the Association of South-East Asian Nations(ASEAN)  have been elected to this important position. Weare confident that  under your guidance  our session willachieve many fine results.Let me take this opportunity to express our highappreciation of the performance of your predecessor Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral. We also hold in highregard the dynamism and perseverance of Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali in the service of ourcommon cause.Last year at this time  we had the opportunity to takea retrospective look at the world’s development over thepast half-century and the role played by the UnitedNations in this long journey. One year later  the worldlandscape is still full of contrasts  interwoven with factorsand trends of hope and with events and tendencies thatgive rise to the concerns of the international communityat this end of the twentieth century.In a world of teeming changes  what emerges asinvariable are the legitimate aspiration and vigorousdetermination of nations to achieve peace anddevelopment based on equality  democracy  respect forthe independence and sovereignty of each country and theidentity of each nation. In this grand endeavour  peoplesturn to the United Nations for timely support and fruitfulassistance because the Organization  having wadedthrough the vicissitudes of a half-century of history  hasbeen daily affirming its crucial role for the world as awhole. Today’s challenge for our world Organization ishow to reform and adapt itself to the new internationalcircumstances in order to meet the expectations of thepeoples.As the system of international relations in the post-cold-war era takes shape  we can already see its trendtowards diversification and multicentrism. In this context multilateral institutions and mechanisms  especially theUnited Nations  have assumed an ever-more essential role.However  there are various ways of interpreting the roleof our Organization today. As regards the vast majority ofthe Member countries  the United Nations  in its capacityas a centre for harmonizing inter-State relations  shouldplay a fundamental role in firmly defending internationallaw and in encouraging States’ strict and consistentrespect for and observation of the United Nations Charter.In this spirit  the United Nations must use its weight andresponsibility to stem the practices — such as coercionand imposition  arbitrary embargo and sanctions that bringsuffering to innocent people  and flagrant interference inthe internal affairs of States  in violation of theirindependence and sovereignty — that run counter to thecurrent general trends.To play its role adequately  the United Nations mustreform itself so as to increase the representativeness of itsinstitutional organs and to democratize and ensure greater15transparency in our Organization’s working procedures andmethods. The cornerstones of the democratization of theUnited Nations system are the reform of the SecurityCouncil and the enhancement of the role of the GeneralAssembly. This is a complex and difficult task whichrequires utmost perseverance. The expansion of thecomposition of the Security Council and thedemocratization of its decision-making procedures constitutean urgent demand of the international community. At thesame time  the authority and role of the General Assembly the broadest and most representative body  must bestrengthened in response to the legitimate appeal of us all.Certainly  the reform must be undertaken on the basis ofthe agreed principles  particularly that of consensus reflecting to the fullest extent the views and aspirations ofthe majority of the member countries and ensuring theinterests of the different regions.If in today’s world democracy in a society means theactive participation of its citizens  democracy ininternational relations requires the active participation of allcountries  large or small  rich or poor. Only an increasinglydemocratized United Nations can enjoy the prestige andconfidence necessary for playing its role in harmonizing theactions of States on the basis of international law  as alldesire it to. Let us build upon the momentum gathered atthe fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations so that onentering the twenty-first century  the United Nations cantruly serve as an example of democratization in the world’spolitical life.The wise way to achieve the common objectives ofnational independence  peace and development is that ofcooperation in the spirit of equality  mutual respect andmutual benefit. The globalization of the world economy  theliberalization of trade and investment and the dizzyingadvances of science and technology now present every Statewith both unprecedented opportunities and imposingchallenges. It is no mere coincidence that the recent summitof the seven major industrialized countries  the G-7  inLyons  focused on the theme of globalization.However  the developing countries  and especially theunderdeveloped ones  are approaching this trial that is sovital for their development and prosperity poorly equippedand in extremely difficult conditions. Therefore  it isincumbent upon the international community and inparticular the developed countries  to give the requiredattention and adequate assistance to help solve this crucialequation  because it is impossible to accept  in the contextof interdependence  a world in which affluence isconcentrated in a small number of countries while themajority of countries continue to struggle againstincreasing poverty and the gap between the rich and thepoor grows inexorably wider.Given its strength and prestige  the United Nationsis able to and needs to play a useful role in this process.In implementing the Agenda for Development  ourOrganization should concentrate first on the regions indifficulty and on the essential issues. With its financialresources and groups of experts  the United Nationssystem can assist the countries of the South to overcometheir disadvantaged position and succeed in their effortsfor timely regional and global integration  in the contextof an economic  trade  scientific and technological race ona global scale.In Viet Nam  for instance  the United NationsDevelopment Programme (UNDP) is carrying out projectsto assist us in our integration into the Association ofSouth-East Asian Nations (ASEAN). UNDP is alsoplaying an active and effective role to facilitate theestablishment of a framework for cooperation among thecountries along the Mekong. UNDP is currently workingon a national capacity-building project so that Viet Namcan be prepared to participate more effectively in theWorld Trade Organization (WTO) in the near future.Such practical bilateral and multilateral developmentprojects are to be welcomed.However  we are now facing a glaring paradox: theneed for international cooperation for developmentcontinues to grow  while the available means become evermore scarce and natural resources more depleted. In thefierce competition for development  States mustconcentrate their resources on domestic needs in order torestructure their economies and solve the pressing socialproblems  thus enhancing their internal strength. That isquite understandable.Nevertheless  in the current context of increasinginterdependence among States  international cooperation especially the flow of capital and technology transferfrom the developed to the developing countries isindispensable  and it is also necessary and beneficial forthe sustainable development of the developed countriesthemselves. Moreover  today  when urgent global issuesare strengthening links between all States  a danger to onenation may also affect others  and the stability andprosperity enjoyed by one society may contribute to anenvironment favourable for the stability and prosperity ofother societies.16Hunger  illness  social injustice and other phenomenaare all potential threats to the security of each country andthe stability of the world as a whole. Allocating ofresources to support the development of developingcountries and contributing in various ways to bilateral andmultilateral international cooperation for development arewise investments for peace and for the shared future of allof our societies.The United Nations is not immune to this discrepancybetween resources and the needs for developmentassistance. Today  the resources available to the UnitedNations are not increasing; on the contrary  they areshrinking or being overextended. This worrisome situationcalls for the attention and responsibility of all MemberStates  especially of the major Powers and developedcountries that possess greater resources and potential. Themeasure to be taken immediately  in the unanimous view ofMember States  is for every State to fulfil its financialobligations. Moreover  all initiatives to providesupplementary resources for the United Nations should beencouraged. Recently  scholars and renowned personalitieshave advanced numerous interesting proposals in thisregard. We are of the view that the General Assemblyshould assign the Working Group on the Financial Situationof the United Nations and other relevant working groupsthe task of seriously studying these proposals in order toexplore all possible ways of providing the United Nationswith the resources necessary to actively assist indevelopment for all — first and foremost  that of theunderdeveloped countries.The United Nations has a rather weighty responsibilityregarding the demands of development. Its role in theglobalization process is therefore no less crucial. Since thebeginning of this decade the United Nations has initiatedand organized a number of world summit conferences on aset of global issues ranging from environment to socialdevelopment  from population to human rights  fromwomen to children — and coming up we have the WorldFood Summit  the aim of which is to find and implementcoordinated measures at all levels — national  regional  andinternational — to solve problems of importance for thefuture of all nations.If in the resolution of crisis and conflicts theparticipation of the majority of countries is somewhatlimited or even indirect  through an intermediarymechanism  in the resolution of the global issues fordevelopment the United Nations has been able to mobilizethe direct participation of all countries  big and small  richand poor  developed and developing  because these are notjust “to whom it may concern” issues. In this manner  theUnited Nations can succeed in its efforts to emerge froma mere reactive role to crises and conflicts and play aproactive role in preventing such conflicts and crises.Clearly  the resolution of global issues is always broadlydemocratic in nature.For all these reasons  we hold that the UnitedNations should further strengthen its role of assistanceand coordination in this essential field and continue toadvance the implementation of programmes of actionalready adopted. It is evident that no organization canreplace the United Nations in this vital role. In fulfillingthis role  the United Nations will see its prestige enhancedand its image brought closer to the life of each nation andeach human being.The year 1996 will go down in the history of VietNam as the beginning of a new stage of development ofour country. Last June  the Eighth Congress of theCommunist Party of Viet Nam was successfullyconcluded. The special significance of this historic eventis that  based on the successes achieved over the last 10years of renewal  reform and national revival  theCongress decided to lead the country into a new phase ofindustrialization and modernization  with a view todoubling by the year 2000 the 1990 per-capita grossdomestic product and essentially transforming Viet Naminto an industrialized country in the next 20 to 25 years.At the same time  we have reaffirmed the pursuit ofour foreign policy of independence and sovereignty openness  the diversification and multilateralism of ourinternational relations  and regional and internationalintegration. It is because of this direction that the foreignpolicy of Viet Nam has achieved and continues to achieveoutstanding results  assisting in the work of nation-building and development in a practical way  andeffectively contributing to the resolution of internationalproblems.Viet Nam has established diplomatic relations withover 160 countries  including all the major Powers andthe most prominent world political-economic centres. VietNam has commercial relations with more than 100countries and investment ties with over 50 countries andterritories. In addition to expanding its relations withcountries of all continents  last year as a full member ofthe Association of South-East Asian Nations  one of themost dynamic and successful of regional organizations Viet Nam actively contributed to regional and worldcooperation and development.17We are participating more actively in the work ofinternational organizations  especially those of the UnitedNations system  as well regional organizations. This year Viet Nam begins its term as a member of the UNICEFExecutive Board  and will present its candidature for a seaton the Economic and Social Council at this session of theGeneral Assembly. We hope to receive the support ofMember countries of the United Nations to be able tocontribute our share to the work of that important body developing and coordinating policies of economic andsocial development and cooperation. We are currentlypreparing for the successful organization of the upcomingseventh Francophone summit to be held in November 1997at Hanoi. As regards broader integration  Viet Nam is alsoactively preparing to participate soon in other internationalorganizations  such as the World Trade Organization andthe Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum.As a new member of the Conference on Disarmament Viet Nam played an active part in the negotiations on theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty  which it recentlysigned. By signing that Treaty  Vietnam joined in the broadappeal of the international community that all States refrainfrom all nuclear testing  regardless of the form  strictlyobserve the ban on all nuclear-tests and undertake concretesteps and measures towards the total elimination of allnuclear weapons. Viet Nam stands ready to cooperate withall countries for the effective implementation of the Treaty contributing to a cleaner environment  to greater confidenceand to consolidation of international security  aimed at amore secure and healthy world. At the same time  we holdthat the verification activities of the Treaty implementationprocess must be carried out in a fair and impartial manner with strict respect for the sovereignty of States. In thisspirit  we view that the proposal for a programme of actionfor the elimination of nuclear weapons submitted recentlyat the Conference on Disarmament by 28 States  includingViet Nam  deserves serious consideration.To achieve the objective and sincere desire to build aViet Nam with a prosperous people  a strong nation and ajust and civilized society  we are determined to bring intofull play the achievements of the reform and renewalprocess and equip ourselves with the internal strengthneeded to move forward steadily on the path of integration.On the basis of our current international relations  we willstrengthen our cooperation with other countries andinternational and regional organizations; we will enhanceproductivity; we will consolidate the peaceful environmentand create international conditions still more favourable  inthe service of the prosperity of our nation as well as for theprosperity of the region and the world.At the threshold of the third millennium  all nation-States are subject to strong pressures of both opportunityand challenge. The vast ability of mankind in this age together with the extraordinary advances in science andtechnology  offers us hope for development and prosperityfor all nations. Yet the poverty that afflicts more than onefifth of the world population and the gap between the richand the poor raise concerns. The opportunities seem greatbut the challenges are acutely felt. To begin the twenty-first century with more hope than anxiety  it will beimportant for us first to enhance our sense ofresponsibility and broaden our overall long-term interests:those of peace and development. There is no doubt thatthe United Nations  the Organization to which we allbelong  will contribute actively towards achieving thatend."
"176",7434,"VUT",51,1996,"﻿First of all  Sir  I offer you my delegation’sheartiest congratulations on the occasion of your election tothe presidency of the fifty-first session of the GeneralAssembly. Your rich experience in bilateral and multilateraldiplomacy is  for my delegation  a guarantee for the successof our work. My country  the Republic of Vanuatu  andyours  Malaysia  enjoy friendly and cooperative relations.I also wish to express my country’s thanks to yourpredecessor  Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral  for thecommitment  competence and skill with which he guidedour work at the fiftieth session of the General Assembly.I wish to express my country’s appreciation to theSecretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for theremarkable work that he has consistently done since thevery beginning of his term of office in the service of ourOrganization. I reaffirm here my Government’s support forthe principle by which  according to tradition  Africa has aright to a second mandate.My Government has made its modest contribution todisarmament and arms-control measures. This modestcontribution has been made in the areas of conventionalweapons and weapons of mass destruction alike. Withregard to conventional weapons  on 10 July 1996 theRepublic of Vanuatu provided the Secretary-General through the Centre for Disarmament Affairs  withinformation on imports  exports and the re-exportation ofweapons covered by the Register of Conventional Armsestablished by the Secretary-General under GeneralAssembly resolution 46/36 L of 9 December 1991. Theinformation I have mentioned is contained in the report ofthe Secretary-General in document A/51/300 of 20 August1996.I wish to reaffirm the position of the Government ofthe Republic of Vanuatu on the complete elimination ofanti-personnel landmines. Indeed  at the fiftieth session ofthe General Assembly  the Republic of Vanuatu voted infavour of resolution 50/70 O entitled “Moratorium on theexport of anti-personnel landmines”. As we all know  themajority of the victims of anti-personnel landmines arewomen and children.In the area of weapons of mass destruction  myGovernment has made its modest contribution throughmeasures at both the regional and international levels. Letus take a look first at the regional level.The Republic of Vanuatu acceded last year to theTreaty of Rarotonga establishing the South PacificNuclear Free Zone. I take this opportunity  on behalf ofthe people and the Government of the Republic of Vanuatu to congratulate the United States of America  the FrenchRepublic and the United Kingdom of Great Britain andNorthern Ireland  which signed the Treaty last year. MyGovernment welcomed the ratification last September bythe French Republic of the Protocols to the RarotongaTreaty and pays tribute to its initiative of sending an expertteam from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)to conduct a radiological study at the sites of Frenchnuclear tests in French Polynesia.In the area of global nuclear disarmament  on 24September 1996 I signed  on behalf of my Government  theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty adopted by theGeneral Assembly on 10 September 1996. Moreover  mycountry acceded to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation ofNuclear Weapons  opened for signature in Moscow  Londonand Washington on 1 July 1968  and supports the indefiniteextension of that Treaty.The Republic of Vanuatu  like other Members of ourOrganization  took note of the Advisory Opinion renderedlast summer by the International Court of Justice  the legalorgan of the United Nations  on the legality of the threat oruse of nuclear weapons. This Advisory Opinion is anadditional commitment in favour of nuclear disarmament.The major objective of measures taken and to be taken bythe Republic of Vanuatu in the coming years is todemonstrate our commitment to the complete and generaldisarmament of our entire planet.I would like to express my Government’s views onsome regional conflicts  namely  those in the formerYugoslavia in Central Europe  in the Great Lakes region inthe heart of the African continent  and in the Middle East.Regarding the situation in the former Yugoslavia in CentralEurope  my Government welcomes the elections held on 14September as an important step forward for the future ofBosnia and Herzegovina. In the Great Lakes region ofAfrica  my Government supports the efforts of ourOrganization  in close cooperation with the Organization ofAfrican Unity  to avert a widespread war in that region.Finally  with respect to the situation in the Middle East  myGovernment congratulates the Palestinian and Israelidelegations on having decided last Sunday  6 October 1996 to resume discussions that should lead to a lasting peace inthat region.In the area of international law  the United Nations through the International Law Commission  must continueto play a major role in the codification of international law.In this respect  the Republic of Vanuatu joins with otherMembers of the United Nations in calling for theconvening of an international conference ofplenipotentiaries entrusted with considering the draftstatute of an international court prepared by theInternational Law Commission and with concluding aconvention establishing an international criminal court.In the area of human rights  in September 1995 theNational Parliament of the Republic of Vanuatu adopteda law on the office of mediators. The mediator began hiswork in late 1995. I take this opportunity to thank theGovernment of Papua New Guinea  in the context ofcooperation between members of the MelanesianSpearhead Group  for its valuable technical assistance inhelping my Government to implement fully and withrelative celerity the provisions of the aforementioned law.Above and beyond the role of mediator  there is obviously  the fundamental law — the Constitution of theRepublic of Vanuatu — which guarantees thefundamental rights and individual freedoms of all of itscitizens.I wish to recall the statement made here by thePrime Minister of the Republic of Vanuatu at last year’scommemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the adoptionof the Charter of the United Nations  in which hereaffirmed the Government of the Republic of Vanuatu’ssupport for the reform and rational management of theUnited Nations system. I also take this opportunity toexpress my Government’s opinion that the scale ofassessments for the apportionment of the expenses of ourOrganization must faithfully reflect the capacity to pay ofthe Member States of our Organization.In the area of development  my Government willparticipate in the special session of the General Assemblynext year devoted to the assessment of Agenda 21 andhopes  with other delegations that have expressed this ideahere  that new commitments will be undertaken towardsthe environment. In this respect  the Environment Unit ofVanuatu’s national bureau of the environment  created in1986 under the auspices of the Ministry of NaturalResources  will work in close collaboration with theenvironmental programme of the Oceanian region inpreparing the Pacific region’s contribution to the work ofthe special session of the General Assembly.Last year  through a decision of the Ministry ofHome Affairs and Decentralization to apply the law ondecentralization within the Republic of Vanuatu  myGovernment reduced the number of provinces from 11to 6. The purpose of this reduction was  first  to allow the2major islands to help the smaller ones; secondly  to allocatefinancial and human resources to all of the provinces; and finally  to demonstrate the will of my Government todecentralize administrative and public functions for thebenefit of provinces. In other words  it encouragescommunities and individuals to participate in the economicand social development of the Republic. In this regard  Itake this opportunity to thank the United NationsDevelopment Programme in its capacity as a multilateralpartner in the regional efforts of all Oceanian States and more particularly  for its valuable assistance to theGovernment of the Republic of Vanuatu in drafting its bookon sustainable human development in Vanuatu. MyGovernment presented this book to the press on23 September.In conclusion  I wish to reaffirm here the faith of theRepublic of Vanuatu in the United Nations."
"177",7468,"WSM",51,1996,"﻿Samoa congratulates you mostwarmly on your highly acclaimed election. It is a particularpleasure for me to express to you our full confidence in andsupport for your presidency. I want also to pay tribute toHis Excellency Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral of Portugalfor his outstanding service and leadership during thehistoric fiftieth session of the Assembly.Samoa welcomes the adoption by this Assembly ofthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) which I will sign on behalf of my Government latertoday. We are signing the Treaty because it is what wehave all sought for so long. We applaud and thankAustralia for the initiative to bring the Treaty directly tothe General Assembly. For us in the Pacific  the CTBTbrings to an end a long and unsatisfactory situation. Toomany nuclear weapons  far too many  were tested in ourregion  and we remain fearful of the consequences especially to our fragile environment and marineresources. Like others  we acknowledge the shortcomingsof the CTBT and regret that it was not possible to reachthe required consensus in the Conference onDisarmament. But that must not be allowed to stand inthe way of the work that remains to be done. The CTBTis a mark of critical progress. We must all now employthe most serious effort in moving the disarmamentprocess further  including bringing the CTBT into force.Today the international community is united  perhapsmore so than at any other time  in recognizing thecomplete elimination of all nuclear weapons as afundamental goal. Samoa is deeply committed to thisgoal  and we will continue to work for its achievementtogether with other members of the United Nations aswell as with members of civil society.It is a matter of the greatest encouragement to myGovernment to have the favourable opinion of theInternational Court of Justice on the question of thelegality of the threat or use of nuclear weapons. Wewelcome in particular the Court’s very timely reminder ofthe obligation to pursue in good faith  and to bring to aconclusion  negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament.We accept entirely the important opinion of the Court thatnuclear disarmament  in all its aspects  must be under strictand effective international control.I should also acknowledge the signing earlier this yearby the United States of America  the United Kingdom andFrance of the Protocols to the South Pacific Nuclear FreeZone Treaty. The prompt ratification by France isappreciated  and we look forward to full adherence by allnuclear-weapon States. We believe that their fullparticipation will not only inspire confidence within ourregion  but will also carry a message of hope for the rest ofthe international community.We place considerable faith in the importance ofnuclear-weapon-free zones and the vital role they play inthe disarmament process. During this session  along withother delegations  Samoa will support efforts aimed atdeveloping links and enhancing cooperation among southernhemisphere nuclear-weapon-free zones.We are from a region which treasures peace andsecurity  and we seek for ourselves the highest measure ofpeaceful coexistence with all countries. We therefore sharein full the anguish of our fellow humans in all countrieswho are being denied the conditions to live and to developin peace and in fulfilment.My Government welcomes the developments in Bosniaand Herzegovina and the implementation of the DaytonAgreement. Our hope is that the recent elections too willserve to provide confidence and trust among all the parties.We continue to pray for lasting peace in the MiddleEast. We commend President Clinton for initiating therecent Washington meetings  and we urge all sides  in therenewed negotiations now taking place in the region  tomake every effort possible to restore stability and directionto the peace process in the spirit of mutual respect.We are also a country which cherishes the UnitedNations Charter and the fundamental principles for whichour Organization stands. This is the basis for our support ofthe sovereignty and territorial integrity of the People’sRepublic of China.We have faith in the elaboration of rules to regulateinternational behaviour and cooperation. Increasingly developments in the international system require both Stateand citizen to submit to international scrutiny. One areathat calls for attention concerns serious humanitarianoffences and crimes of international concern  includingterrorism. Samoa fully supports the early establishment ofan international criminal court to deal with these crimes.Reforms of the United Nations were given a greatdeal of focus at the fiftieth session and much has alreadybeen said during this general debate  and rightly so. Atalmost every level  the Organization remains in need ofsubstantial change and improvement. My own country isfully committed in its support for the ongoing efforts tostrengthen and revitalize our Organization to make itmore democratic  fair and representative. I must say however  that having only a small delegation to cope withthe multifaceted work being carried out in the five high-level Working Groups  we feel both disadvantaged and at times  dispirited about the pace and often the directionof the discussions.The membership of the Security Council must beenlarged to reflect the realities of the present time and toenhance the Council’s effectiveness and legitimacy. Thereis need to give particular consideration to the case ofJapan and Germany. My Government is also giving themost serious thought to proposals  such as that of Italy that would ensure the proper and regular representation ofsmall States and their concerns in the work of theCouncil. We think the discussions during this sessionshould try and focus on areas with regard to which thereis reasonable chance of progress and on which significantconsensus can be consolidated. We do not see the pointin endless open-ended discussions.We share fully the concerns voiced about the veryserious and unsatisfactory financial situation of the UnitedNations. The payment of assessed contributions is a freelyaccepted responsibility and a solemn duty that all Statesmust discharge promptly and without condition. Samoawillingly accepts this duty and will continue to meet itsown financial obligations. However  we must say againthat the current floor rate has rendered the present scaleof assessments inequitable for small and least developedStates like my own. A recent report of the Committee onContributions has given attention to this anomaly  and wefeel that timely action must be taken to work out a fairersystem of assessment based on capacity to pay in realterms.Next year  during your presidency  Sir  we shallhave to undertake the five-year review of Agenda 21. Itwill be a first and timely opportunity for comprehensive2assessment and for giving momentum to sustainabledevelopment. Given your prominence at the United NationsConference on Environment and Development in 1992  weshall have to look to you for an extra measure of leadershipto ensure solid results from the review and effectiveperformance from the institutions charged withimplementing Agenda 21.Samoa  together with other small island States continues to emphasize the importance of the Programmeof Action for the Sustainable Development of Small IslandDeveloping States. It is a realistic plan for our sustainableeconomic development. While our endeavours to implementthe Programme of Action have been greatly assisted andfacilitated by United Nations organs  achievement isultimately a matter of national effort and perseverance.With the crucial support of the international community  wemust continue to hold high the ethic of self-sufficiency.The sea and its resources provide real prospects forour development. The legal regimes that govern them andtheir use are matters of vital importance to Samoa. Theywill continue to receive our closest attention. We welcomethe election of members of the International Tribunal forthe Law of the Sea and the establishment of theInternational Seabed Authority. We think it is appropriateto grant United Nations observer status to the Authority andwe will support the efforts to strengthen the organization ofthe Authority and to ensure its financial viability.The preservation of our environment is a majorpreoccupation for my country. We will continue to makeevery effort to be engaged in international discussions andto contribute to the development of internationalenvironmental principles and modalities to ensure that ourconcerns are adequately reflected. Recourse to internationallaw and to effective international mechanisms is theultimate protection and security for small States.The global climate is changing  and the impact of this especially the rise in the sea level  pose the most seriousdangers for Samoa and for all small islands. As a memberof the Alliance of Small Island States  we have pressed andwill continue to press our concerns for immediate andeffective international action.The second assessment report of the IntergovernmentalPanel on Climate Change confirms what we have longfeared: human activity is warming and changing the climatesystem. Ministers of the Environment who attended thesecond Conference of the Parties in Geneva in July thisyear endorsed the report as the most comprehensive andauthoritative assessment of climate science.The Panel’s report underlines the real urgency of theclimate change negotiations mandated at Berlin last year.Current commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissionsunder the Convention will not be enough to arrest globalwarming  and additional and effective commitments byindustrialized countries extending beyond the year 2000must be established. In 1994  the Alliance of Small IslandStates submitted possible solutions as set out in its draftprotocol. It remains the only complete proposal on thetable.We now have barely a year before the need tofinalize negotiations of a protocol or another legalinstrument to strengthen the Convention on ClimateChange for adoption at the Conference of the Parties nextyear in Kyoto  Japan. We call on all Convention partiesto move with all seriousness and urgency on the matter.The General Assembly has a full and comprehensiveagenda before it. Under your leadership we have everyreason to look forward to firm and positive results."
"178",7512,"YEM",51,1996,"﻿It is a pleasure for me to warmly congratulate Mr. Razalion his election to the presidency of the fifty-first session ofthe General Assembly. We are sure that his extensiveexperience and political sophistication will make asignificant contribution to the success of its work. I shouldlike also to express my thanks and appreciation to hispredecessor for his judicious management of the work ofthe General Assembly during its last session.I would like to take this opportunity to express oncemore my country’s appreciation of the role played by theSecretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  and of hissincere  invaluable efforts to strengthen the role of theOrganization in keeping abreast of international events anddevelopments to the benefit of all humanity and in order topreserve international peace and security. On behalf ofYemen  I would also like to express my country’s supportfor the re-election of Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali for asecond term as Secretary-General so he can continue thecomprehensive restructuring of the United Nations  whichwill enable it to play a significant and fundamental roleresponsive to the demands of the twenty-first century.As this session is being held  new and dangerousdevelopments are taking place  threatening peace andsecurity in the Middle East. The situation in Jerusalem andother parts of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip hasexploded as a result of the aggressive unjustified actionsand harsh practices undertaken by the Israeli authoritiesagainst the Palestinian people  and their continued attemptsto change the character of Holy Al-Quds Al-Sharif. Themost recent of these attempts was Israel’s opening of atunnel linking Al-Borac Square and Al-Mujahidin Streetnear Bab Al-Asbat  threatening the integrity of Al-HaramAl-Sharif and other Islamic monuments. During the last fewdays  the Israeli army and police force have used variouskinds of weapons and live ammunition against unarmedPalestinian protesters. These clashes have caused thedeath or injury of hundreds of innocent Palestinians.We strongly condemn and denounce the actions andpractices of the Israeli military forces and their repeatedacts of aggression against Palestinian officials and citizensin Arab Al-Quds and other Palestinian towns  which haveled to the death and injury of hundreds of people. Theterrorism and oppression carried out by the Israelioccupying authority constitute a gross violation of humanrights  legitimate international resolutions and the FourthGeneva Convention  which applies to occupied territories.This critical development can only exacerbate thesituation and return the region to a cycle of tension andviolence. It threatens peace and security not only in theMiddle East region but in the whole world.This year  the Republic of Yemen celebrated thesixth anniversary of its unification  achieved aftersuccessfully overcoming all the difficulties and challengesin the way of unity and development. These celebrationscoincided with preparations for voter registration for thesecond parliamentary elections since the reunification ofour country  which are to be held in April 1997reinforcing democracy in our country. Our democraticapproach is demonstrated by our political pluralism  andour respect for human rights and freedom of the press and will enable us to achieve qualitative changes in theeconomic  social and political life of Yemeni citizens.Today the Republic of Yemen is enjoying stability a democratic process and economic reforms  which mustenjoy the encouragement and support of the internationalcommunity since this democratic process will contributeto the strengthening of security and stability at the localand regional levels.At the same time  our people are in the midst of adifficult and important battle for social and economicdevelopment and modernization and for the elimination ofbackwardness. Some of the most serious problems weface as a developing country are inflation  the increase inthe rates of population growth and their effects on thegrowth rate of the national economy. In order to deal withthat  the Government has adopted a programme ofeconomic  financial and administrative reforms incooperation with the International Monetary Fund and theInternational Bank for Reconstruction and Developmentwith the aim of correcting economic  financial andstructural imbalances. This has been done to achievebalance and stability in the economy as a whole and to20activate the role of the private sector on the basis of amarket economy and free competition  while taking intoaccount the importance of improving basic essential socialservices  building a modern State and improving thestandard of living of citizens.Efforts by the Yemeni Government to implement thisprogramme have yielded improvements and have hadnotable success  especially in preventing the collapse of thelocal currency  reducing the rate of inflation and achievinga positive growth rate. However  it has proved difficult toalleviate suffering in the social sphere. These difficultieshave been compounded by the disastrous floods whichplagued Yemen last June  causing extensive  grave losses oflife and property. These affected some parts of theinfrastructure and harmed many people. Agricultural landwas eroded and livestock was destroyed. Houses  roads bridges  health centres  sources of drinking water andschools in many areas of the Republic of Yemen were alldestroyed. These losses and damages were a major disasterand economic setback for Yemen.I would like to take this opportunity to renew my callfor international and humanitarian organizations andfraternal and friendly Governments to provide help andsupport to overcome the disastrous effects of the floods. Iwould also like to thank all those organizations andGovernments that have responded and offered support forand solidarity with the people of Yemen in their ordeal.The Republic of Yemen  in the framework of itspolitical orientation  is pursuing a foreign policy based onmutual respect and the common interests of States. Ittherefore stresses the importance of maintaining security stability and cooperation among all States in the region. Inthis regard  demarcation of the border between our countryand the fraternal Sultanate of Oman has been definitivelyconcluded through a dialogue based upon mutual interests equitable treatment and respect for the rights of bothcountries. This achievement represents a significant positivestep that will serve security and stability in the region anddeepen trust between the two countries. Similarly  ourcountry is working with the same sincerity and credibilityto settle the issue of the border with the fraternal Kingdomof Saudi Arabia on the basis of mutual interests and in thelight of the Taif Agreement and the contents of thememorandum of understanding signed by the two countrieson 26 February 1995 in the Holy City of Mecca.Pursuant to this  joint committees have been formed todiscuss the border issue  its demarcation  the developmentof all aspects of cultural  trade and economic relations andthe strengthening of cooperation between the two fraternalcountries.Moreover  a security agreement was signed on 27July 1996 that emphasized the concerns of both countriesfor their joint security and to combat terrorism  exchangesecurity information and strengthen cooperation betweentheir institutions  thus giving concrete form to the spirit ofthe 1934 Taif Treaty and the memorandum ofunderstanding signed on 26 February 1995. An agreementon technical  investment  trade and economic cooperationwas also signed.The Republic of Yemen has shown a sincere desireand strong political will and has made continuous effortsto address the matter of the Eritrean occupation inmid-December 1995 of the Yemeni island of Hanishal-Kabir in the Red Sea. While negotiations were takingplace between the two countries aimed at reaching apeaceful settlement that would respect legal  historical andgeographical rights  our country did not opt for the use offorce. From the very first day  we stressed the necessityof using peaceful means  dialogue through mediators andinternational arbitration in order to spare the twoneighbouring peoples the scourges of war and conflict  inkeeping with its belief in the principles and purposes ofthe United Nations and its commitment to the provisionsof the Charter. Accordingly  an agreement of principlesbetween Yemen and Eritrea was officially signed in Parison 21 May 1996. This was the fruit of French  Egyptianand Ethiopian mediation efforts and of the support of ourSecretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali. Thisagreement was a sound basis on which to settle peacefullythe dispute between the two countries regarding issues ofterritorial sovereignty and maritime borders. On this basis discussions have begun on special arbitration measuresand the mechanism to be used with a view to starting theprocess as soon as possible. It is unfortunate that  despiteall these procedures  Eritrea took new action on the islandof Hanish af-Saghir on 10 August 1996. This act violatedthe agreement of principles and created an atmosphere oftension and conflict in the region  threatening stability security and the safety of international shipping in theregion.Now that Eritrea has withdrawn its forces from theisland of Hanish af-Saghir and the crisis has passed  wewould like to express our thanks and appreciation for therole played and efforts made by France and its specialenvoy  and the positions of the Secretary-General and thePresident and members of the Security Council  and to allthose fraternal and friendly States that declared their21support for the principles agreed upon for resolving theconflict peacefully through arbitration. Finally  my countrywould like to stress that a peaceful settlement is the properway to improve relations between Yemen and Eritrea andto promote the trust necessary to creating an atmosphereconducive to the development of relations between the twocountries and the peoples of Yemen and Eritrea.The civil war in Somalia has gone beyond the boundsof reason and  as our country is a neighbour of fraternalSomalia  we have found ourselves shouldering the burdenof receiving and housing tens of thousands of refugees. Wehave also cooperated with the United Nations HighCommissioner for Refugees and non-governmentalorganizations in sheltering and feeding the Somali refugees although this is a heavy burden on our country andcompounds its existing economic and social ills.We are deeply disturbed by the continuingfragmentation  fighting and uncertainty in Somalia. TheRepublic of Yemen considers that the responsibility forsolving the refugee problem  which is a social andeconomic burden of significant proportions  and the solutionof the Somali problem lie with the Somalis themselves. Onthat basis  we urge the Somali leadership once again todemonstrate greater political will and a genuine desire toreach a final settlement for peace and stability in theircountry and to engage in dialogue in order to save theirpeople  rebuild their country and give the refugees theopportunity to return to their homes and resettle. In orderto facilitate this  Yemen has received a number of Somalileaders and made every effort to assist the Somalisthemselves to reach a national accord acceptable to all. Wehope these efforts will be successful. The achievement ofnational reconciliation in Somalia and the improvement ofsecurity and stability in that country and the entire Horn ofAfrica are at the forefront of our concerns  embodying ourhistorical and strategic relationships  which are inextricablyintertwined with all the States of the region.In view of the Republic of Yemen’s positive supportfor the peace process in the Middle East  which began withthe Madrid Conference in October 1991  guaranteeing a justand comprehensive peace on the basis of legitimateinternational resolutions  particularly Security Councilresolutions 242 (1967)  338 (1973) and 425 (1978)  andsubsequent agreements and protocols in this regard  and onthe basis of the principle of land for peace and guaranteesof complete Israeli withdrawal from all occupied Arabterritories  we once again emphasize the necessity for alasting  just and comprehensive peace as the basis forsecurity  stability and prosperity in the region. Only this canensure that the root causes of violence and extremism willbe destroyed and that the values of tolerance  peacefulcoexistence and civilized cooperation among peoples willbe promoted.Accordingly  we would like to express our concernabout the resumption of the Israeli policy of settlement onPalestinian land  especially around the city of Al-QudsAl-Sharif. The Israelis are establishing settlements destroying Palestinian houses  building bypass roads forIsraeli settlers  continuing the blockade of Palestinianlands and refusing to redeploy Israeli forces out ofHebron. These Israeli practices constitute blatantviolations of agreements and pledges made between Israeland the Palestinian Authority and can only exacerbatetensions and return the peace process to its starting point possibly even derailing the entire process.We therefore stress the importance of making rapidprogress towards a final settlement leading to restorationof the Palestinians’ legitimate rights  particularly therights to self-determination and to establish anindependent State with Jerusalem as its capital  inaccordance with relevant international resolutions and thebasic principles underlying the Madrid Conference.Negotiations on the basis of those principles and with allparties respecting their commitments should be conductedon all tracks.The peace process is currently facing risks andchallenges that are preventing it from achieving its aims.Israel is deliberately dragging its feet and is persistent inits procrastination over negotiations with the Syrian ArabRepublic on the basis of the agreements reached by bothparties under the previous Israeli Government. Among themost important of these was the obligation to withdrawfully from the occupied Syrian Golan and southernLebanon in accordance with relevant internationalresolutions and the principle of “land for peace”. Westress the need for Israel to respect the sovereignty andindependence of fraternal Lebanon  release Lebaneseprisoners and detainees from Israeli concentration campsand acknowledge its responsibility to compensateLebanon for the losses it has sustained as a result of thecontinuing Israeli acts of aggression against its land andpeople.A just  comprehensive and lasting peace in theMiddle East  together with security and stability in theregion  can be achieved only if every State of the regionfulfils its obligations equally and through theestablishment of a nuclear-  biological- and chemical-22weapon-free zone in the region. Israel must ratify theTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons andsubmit its nuclear installations to the internationalinspection regime as a step towards establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East and freeing the areafrom the threat of all weapons of mass destruction. In thiscontext  we would like to express our satisfaction at thesigning of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty atthe beginning of this session. Yemen will sign the Treatytoday.While Yemen stresses the importance of Iraq’s totalcompliance with resolutions of the international communityand its continuing cooperation with the United Nations  wewould also stress the need to preserve the unity  territorialsovereignty and integrity of Iraq. We also express our greatconcern about and condemnation of any action in thisregard affecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity ofIraq and appeal for the alleviation of the suffering of theIraqi people. We therefore welcome the memorandum ofunderstanding signed in May 1996 between Iraq and theUnited Nations on the implementation of Security Councilresolution 986 (1995)  providing for the sale of petroleumfor the purchase of food as a first step towards alleviatingthe terrible suffering of the fraternal Iraqi people.We call upon the international community and theSecurity Council to pursue the lifting of the air blockadeand other measures imposed on the Libyan Arab Jamahiriyapursuant to Security Council resolutions and to respond tothe resolutions and proposals of regional organizations. Themost recent of these was the initiative put forward at theemergency Arab summit held in Cairo from 21 to 23 June1996 in order to resolve the conflict between the LibyanArab Jamahiriya and the three countries concerned.The Republic of Yemen renews its call to the fraternalcountries of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the UnitedArab Emirates to continue a direct dialogue aimed atreaching a peaceful settlement of the issue of the threeislands of Greater Tunb  Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa  inaccordance with the Charter of the United Nations and theprinciples of good neighbourliness and respect for thesovereignty and territorial integrity of States in the region and to resort to international arbitration in a manner thatwill satisfy both parties.Our country also emphasizes its solidarity withfraternal Bahrain and expresses its complete support for themeasures it has taken to ensure its security and stability.The tragic situation of the people of Bosnia andHerzegovina has preoccupied the Yemeni people. TheRepublic of Yemen therefore welcomes the Agreementsthat the parties involved in the conflict reached lastNovember in Dayton and Paris in order to bring peace toBosnia and Herzegovina  and to express its satisfactionwith the contents of the Agreements  which stressed thesovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic ofBosnia and Herzegovina. On this occasion  we wish toregister our appreciation of the efforts made by the UnitedStates of America and the States of the European Unionto bring about these Agreements. We call upon theinternational community to provide every possible supportto the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina and their plansfor the development and reconstruction of their country.We would also stress the need for every party tosurrender all war criminals to the International Tribunalin The Hague so that they may be brought to account fortheir heinous crimes against humanity in violation ofinternational law  human rights and internationalagreements.The Republic of Yemen  in view of its geographicalposition on the Indian Ocean  places particular importanceon any effort made to strengthen cooperation between theOcean’s littoral States. Accordingly  our country took partin the most recent meeting  held in Mauritius  to completethe drafting of the constitution and platform of action forthe planned Indian Ocean rim initiative.We take this opportunity to express our satisfactionwith the work of the Ad Hoc Committee on the IndianOcean to implement the Declaration of the Indian Oceanas a Zone of Peace  free of nuclear weapons. We callupon the permanent members of the Security Council andmaritime users of the Indian Ocean to participate in thework of the Committee in order to strengthen security peace  stability and cooperation in the region inaccordance with relevant General Assembly resolutions.In conclusion  I should like to express our hope thatthe work of this session will enjoy every success strengthening the United Nations and its bodies andenabling them to achieve their goals and the idealsembodied in the Charter in a manner appropriate to thespirit of the age and international changes"
"179",7578,"ZAF",51,1996,"﻿I should like first to extendwarm congratulations to Mr. Razali Ismail on his electionto the presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-firstsession. We have no doubt that the session will benefitfrom his known skills as he discharges his responsibilities.I should also like to commend Mr. Diogo Freitasdo Amaral for the excellent work done during his term ofoffice.I should also like to express to the Secretary-General Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  our continued confidence in hisguidance of the Organization.Allow me at the outset of this  my first opportunity tospeak before the General Assembly  to express the deepgratitude and appreciation of the people and Government ofSouth Africa for the decision taken by the Assembly at thefiftieth session to relieve the new democratic Governmentof South Africa of the burden of the contribution to theUnited Nations budget accumulated over the period of twodecades when the apartheid regime was excluded fromparticipating in the work of the General Assembly. Werecognize that that action involved considerable sacrifice both for the United Nations and for its Member States  andthat it was also consistent with the historic commitment ofsupport for our struggle for democracy.South Africa remains committed to achieving a worldfree of all weapons of mass destruction and to addressingthe issue of the proliferation of conventional weapons. Wetherefore welcome the adoption of the ComprehensiveNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT)  which we signedyesterday.Our support for the CTBT as an instrument ofdisarmament and non-proliferation is based upon the viewthat this Treaty is an integral part of a process which willlead to the full implementation of the nuclear-disarmamentobligations set out in article VI of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.An important milestone along this road was theadoption of the Pelindaba Treaty creating the AfricanNuclear-Weapon-Free Zone. This Treaty will contributegreatly to measures aimed at achieving a world free fromnuclear weapons. Further steps are needed in the process tobring the world closer to the ultimate goal of theelimination of nuclear weapons. The next step is forAfrican States to cooperate with parties to the othernuclear-weapon-free-zones in the Pacific and LatinAmerican regions with a view to promoting a southernhemisphere-wide nuclear-weapon-free zone. We areheartened by the unprecedented step of four nuclear-weapon States’ signing the relevant Protocols of thePelindaba Treaty simultaneously with African States inApril 1996  while the fifth has indicated that it will signshortly. South Africa  as stated previously in otherforums  will also work for the commencement next yearof negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament on atreaty banning the production of fissile material fornuclear weapons.South Africa also supports and will work for theestablishment of an ad hoc committee on nucleardisarmament in the Conference on Disarmament. Thiscommittee can identify and negotiate the necessary stepsby which we can achieve the ultimate goal of the eventualelimination of nuclear weapons. We also look forward tothe early ratification of the Chemical WeaponsConvention by those States that have not yet done so.It is not just the threat posed by all weapons of massdestruction and their means of delivery that is of seriousconcern to my Government  but also the build-up ofconventional weapons beyond a level which can beconsidered legitimate for the purposes of self-defence.Conventional weapons are  in fact  the cause of most ofthe deaths and suffering of millions of people in conflictsaround the world today.My Government would therefore like to encourageall States Members of the United Nations to support andparticipate in the United Nations Register of ConventionalArms  and lend active support to General Assemblyresolution 50/70 B on small arms and its panel ofgovernmental experts mandated to assist the Secretary-General to prepare a report on small arms. We would alsoencourage Member States to support the worldwideefforts to secure the elimination of anti-personnellandmines. In order to alleviate the suffering caused bylandmines  my Government is committed to reinforcinginternational cooperation. As a country with advanceddemining technology  we are pleased to be making amodest contribution to international efforts to unearthlandmines.South Africa will continue to cooperate in thevarious international forums dedicated to thenon-proliferation of the technologies and equipment which17could be used in the development of weapons of massdestruction  and in discouraging any destabilizing build upof conventional weapons.Our harrowing experience under the tyranny ofapartheid has imposed a duty on us to place a highpremium on the promotion of human rights. In this regard our Constitution contains an entrenched and fully justiciableBill of Rights. In addition  plans are advanced for theestablishment of an office on the status of women toprovide a mechanism within the Government to act as amonitor to ensure that a gender perspective is integratedinto all publicly-funded policies and programmes. TheSouth African Government regards it as a priority tocontribute to the efforts of the international community tocombat the violation of human rights.In South Africa  and in the region as a whole processes of democratization have released a host ofproductive human and political resources. This has  in manyways  contributed to the achievement of peace  security andstability in our region.Our vision for southern Africa is one of the highestpossible degree of economic cooperation  mutual assistanceand the joint planning of regional development initiatives leading to full economic integration.Civil conflicts have ravaged many parts of Africa. Wewelcome the positive developments which have taken placein Rwanda and Sierra Leone. However  serious conflictpersists in Liberia  Burundi and Somalia. The South AfricanGovernment is committed to playing an active role in theongoing efforts of the international community to assist thepeople of Burundi to bring about lasting peace and nationalreconciliation. President Mandela recently appointed aspecial representative for Burundi  who has been given thetask of searching for a viable solution in close coordinationwith other special representatives and with countries in theregion. These efforts need to be supplemented by closecooperation between the Organization of African Unity(OAU) and the United Nations.At the same time  we are heartened by the progress albeit tentative so far  towards peace in Angola.Representatives of Member countries assembled here willagree that the people of Angola deserve peace at last as aninstrument for — or rather  as an important ingredient of —embarking on the road to sustainable economicdevelopment and social advancement. Our Governmentcommends the efforts of the United Nations  and especiallythose of the Special Representative of the Secretary-Generalfor Angola  Maître Alioune Blondin Beye  who has withtremendous patience and commitment guided the Angolanpeace process to the stage where it is today. We owe it tothe people of Angola to see this process through to itslogical conclusion.Through the Organization of African Unity (OAU)Mechanism for Conflict Prevention  Management andResolution  member States of the OAU are collectivelycommitted to restoring peace and security on ourcontinent. In support of the OAU mechanism  we arepleased that the Southern African DevelopmentCommunity has recently created an organ on politics defence and security. These efforts reflect Africa’sprimary concern with issues of preventive diplomacy andconflict resolution.South Africa welcomed the spirit of dialogue andrealism that had begun to characterize the relationsbetween Israel and Palestine and was hopeful that thispositive development would gradually replace thecenturies of conflict in the Middle East. That hope wasfurther reinforced by the Declaration of Principles onInterim Self-Government Arrangements reached in Oslo.My Government is concerned  however  that recentdevelopments in the Middle East are likely to reverse andjeopardize the peace process. We therefore urge all theplayers in the Middle East to rise to the occasion and  ina spirit of reconciliation  to move steadfastly towards alasting peace in the region.We are seriously concerned by the marginalization particularly of African countries among the least-developed countries  from the process of globalization andliberalization. In this regard  closer attention should begiven to the need to address the external debt burden ofthe least-developed countries  especially those in Africa.Problems associated with the debt burden and itsservicing still persist and frustrate the rate at which thecontinent can extricate itself from the vicious cycle ofpoverty.We therefore welcome the Mid-term Review of theImplementation of the United Nations New Agenda forthe Development of Africa in the 1990s and recognize theimportance of the United Nations System-wide SpecialInitiative on Africa  as well as the need to underpin itssuccess through appropriate and adequate resources.In this context we also welcome the designation of1996 as the International Year for the Eradication ofPoverty. We hope that the international community will18realize this objective in clear recognition of the challengesfacing it.We welcome the World Food Summit  which is toconvene in Rome in November 1996 and which will affordthe international community the opportunity to demonstrateits commitment to ensuring that poverty eradicationstrategies are fully integrated into all initiatives of theUnited Nations system.My Government is encouraged by the outcome of theUnited Nations Conference on Human Settlements(HABITAT II). The results of the Conference represent thecollaborative efforts of the international community todevelop a consensus view on the fundamental need toprovide access to adequate shelter and infrastructure for allpeople. Continued support for initiatives at the national andinternational level to realize and implement the necessaryfollow-up to HABITAT II should now receive priorityattention.It was an honour for South Africa to host the ninthsession of the United Nations Conference on Trade andDevelopment (UNCTAD) in April 1996. My Governmentbelieves that the sound basis for cooperation established byUNCTAD IX and the call for partnership for growth anddevelopment outlined in the Midrand Declaration must becarried forward and implemented through the GeneralAssembly and other forums. South Africa is particularlykeen to ensure that the framework which we adopted atMidrand for the reform of UNCTAD is translated into aneffective facility for the developing world.South Africa also wishes to underscore thefundamental importance of international cooperation in theenvironmental and development fields. Sustained politicalcommitment through global partnership remains essentialfor our continuing international cooperation efforts. It is forthis reason that we believe that the 1997 special session ofthe General Assembly will provide an excellent opportunityto reaffirm the principles and objectives of the RioDeclaration’s Agenda 21.South Africa  a country with a long coastline  hasconsiderable interest in matters relating to the law of thesea. We are thus pleased that the United NationsConvention on the Law of the Sea and its implementingAgreement have entered into force  and that theInternational Sea-Bed Authority and related structures  ofwhich South Africa is proud to be a member  have beenestablished.In my statement to the General Assembly during thefiftieth session  I expressed the sincere hope thatsignificant progress would be made in bringing about theestablishment of an international criminal court. It istherefore gratifying to see that the Preparatory Committeeon the Establishment of an International Criminal Court which was established during the fiftieth session  hasmade much progress in bringing this idea to fruition.What is now needed is to take this process forward byholding as soon as possible a diplomatic conferencewhere the statute of the proposed court can be finalized.It is widely acknowledged that the favourablechanges in the international climate are conducive to thereform and modernization of the United Nations in orderto prepare the Organization to respond effectively to thechallenges of the twenty-first century.I wish to recall that in his address on 23 October1995 at the Special Commemorative Meeting of theGeneral Assembly  President Mandela  said:“Indeed the United Nations has to reassess itsrole  redefine its profile and reshape itsstructures. It should truly reflect the diversityof our universe and ensure equity among thenations in the exercise of power within thesystem of international relations in general  andthe Security Council in particular.” (OfficialRecords of the General Assembly  FiftiethSession  Plenary Meetings  37th meeting  p. 6)In this regard  my delegation wishes to register itsdisappointment at the slow pace of advancement  with noend in sight to the deliberations of the Working Group onthe question of equitable representation and increase inthe membership of the Security Council and other mattersrelating to the Security Council. In this regard we supportthe recommendation in the report of the Working Groupthat the Group should continue with its work. We wouldalso urge Member States to demonstrate flexibility andaccommodation in their future deliberations and to displaythe necessary political will in order to reach a commonunderstanding.In the declaration that the Heads of State andGovernment adopted on the occasion of the fiftiethanniversary of the United Nations on 24 October 1995  itwas noted that“In order to carry out its work effectively  theUnited Nations must have adequate resources.19Member States must meet  in full and on time  theirobligation to bear the expenses of the Organization  asapportioned by the General Assembly. Thatapportionment should be established on the basis ofcriteria agreed to and considered to be fair by MemberStates.” (A/50/48  para. 15)My delegation has taken note of the progress of theWorking Group on the financial situation in highlighting theproblems facing the Organization  and urges all MemberStates to pay what is legally due as soon as possible inorder that we may direct our energies to the real problemsfacing the world at this time. As we approach the twenty-first century  let us together resolve to redefine the role andshape of the United Nations and render this institutionbetter equipped to carry out the important task of advancingpeace and development in the world."
"180",7621,"ZMB",51,1996,"﻿It is with great pleasure thatI take this opportunity to warmly congratulate you on yourunanimous election as President of the General Assemblyat its fifty-first regular session. Your election is a tributenot only to your country  Malaysia  but also to youpersonally. I am aware that you bring to the presidency ofthe General Assembly wide experience in the field ofinternational relations  from which we stand to benefitimmensely. I would also like to wish you every success inyour important duties. I would further like to affirm thereadiness of my delegation to cooperate with you in thedischarge of your duties.Allow me also to pay tribute to Mr. Diogo Freitas doAmaral of Portugal  who presided over the fiftieth regularsession of the General Assembly with great skill anddedication. His presidency did indeed enhance thedeliberative role of the General Assembly.Furthermore  my delegation would like to record itsappreciation for the work of our esteemed Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  carried out undertrying conditions. Zambia greatly values the contribution ofthe Secretary-General to the reform process of the UnitedNations and can only hope that the entire membershipwill give him a second term in order for him to completethese reforms.This session of the General Assembly is distinctivebecause it is being held in the aftermath of the historicfiftieth anniversary of the United Nations  which weobserved last year. It will be recalled that in observingand celebrating that important event  we made solemncommitments to steer the world body towards theprogressive development of a world community thatwould be cooperating effectively in dealing with globalproblems in the interest of humanity. We also agreed thatthe United Nations should be more democratic transparent and responsive and should be the commonproperty of all the people of the world  in whose name itwas created in the first place. We went on to state that wewanted all citizens of the world to have real ownership ofthe Organization. We also set for ourselves economic andsocial goals. In some cases  we went as far as to agree onspecific time-bound targets by which progress would bemeasured. This session  therefore  marks the beginning ofa process of fulfilling these solemn commitments that wemade last year.Crucial to fulfilling these commitments is the issueof the reform of the United Nations  which is now underway. Reform and continuous renewal are indispensable ifthe future of the Organization is to be secured. All of ushave to play our part with the hope and determinationnecessary to carry forward the United Nations reformagenda with speed and thoroughness. In this way  we canwork towards strengthening the Organization and make itserve humanity more effectively. It is my conviction thatthe United Nations can achieve greater success if we  thestakeholders  work towards creating a much improvedOrganization.As the twenty-first century approaches  the greatestchallenge facing the international community is to improvethe living conditions of the majority of people. Everyhuman being must have access to opportunities that afforda decent livelihood under conditions that are free fromwant  disease  hunger and ignorance. The World Summitfor Social Development held in Copenhagen last yearadopted a framework to deal with poverty and other socialproblems. Far too many people  especially women andchildren  are vulnerable to marginalization and deprivation.We need to invest more resources to end the conditions ofendemic human deprivation existing in many parts of theworld today.There are several other areas where we need toimprove the social conditions of life. The first ever WorldCongress on the Sexual Exploitation of Children  held inStockholm  Sweden  in August this year  presented ingraphic detail the atrocities being committed againstchildren. Many young lives are being wasted in the huge illegal international business of child prostitution andpornography. As a civilized world  we cannot allowlifestyles that are attuned to the sexual abuse of children. Itis the hope of my delegation that all countries of the worldwill work expeditiously to implement the Agenda forAction adopted at the World Congress. In the same vein the international community must continue to protect andpromote the rights of the child by implementing theprovisions of the Declaration and Programme of Action ofthe World Summit for Children.The United Nations has also articulated variousprogrammes aimed at the improvement of the status ofwomen and youth. Commitments contained in the BeijingDeclaration and Platform for Action  as well as the WorldProgramme of Action for Youth to the Year 2000 andBeyond  require the devoted attention of the internationalcommunity  especially with regard to empowermentstrategies in the critical areas of employment  education health and participation in societal decision-making. It isincumbent upon us all to honour the commitments we madein the declarations and the programmes of action. Mycountry has committed itself to the attainment of theobjectives contained in these documents. Women andchildren are invaluable resources that can be neglectedonly at the world’s own peril.It is fitting that we begin this session shortly afterthe adoption of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-BanTreaty (CTBT). Zambia supported the adoption of thisTreaty because of our commitment to general andcomplete disarmament under effective internationalcontrol. It is in the same spirit that my country signed thePelindaba Treaty  establishing Africa as a nuclear-freezone  on 11 April this year. Zambia will be signing theCTBT with the hope that all other countries of the worldwill do so as well  in the spirit of the traditionalrecognition by the United Nations that disarmament is oneof the priority questions of international relations. In thisregard  Zambia would like to call on nuclear-weaponStates to inject a new spirit of commitment to ensuringnuclear disarmament  in accordance with article 6 of theTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.In this connection  my delegation wishes to reiteratethe conviction that the time has indeed come for theconvening of another special session of the GeneralAssembly  in 1999  devoted to disarmament. Mydelegation believes that such a session would offeradditional possibilities for the international community toreview  from a perspective more in tune with the currentinternational situation  the most critical aspects of theprocess of disarmament in the post-cold-war era.It is common knowledge that in most of today’sconflicts the most widely used weapons are small armsand light weapons. None is more menacing than land-mines  the use of which is widespread. Currently morethan 110 million of them are buried in various parts ofthe world  mostly in developing countries. The worldcannot continue to lose human lives from these lethalweapons. In this regard  my delegation fully supports callsfor the banning at the global level of the use  stockpiling production and sale of anti-personnel land-mines for alltime. Zambia will therefore support initiatives  during thissession of the General Assembly  to effect such a globalban.The issue of small arms and light weapons bringsme to the question of conflicts in various parts of theworld that our Organization has increasingly been calledupon to resolve. The international community faces thechallenge of bringing peace in countries where warringfactions show  in some cases  irreconcilable ethnicdifferences and other forms of intolerance.2The African region has its sad share of these conflictsthat have led to great loss of life  displacement of peopleand the disruption of vital economic activities. Burundi isone such major challenge. The measures to restore theparliament in Burundi and unban political parties  whichwere announced on 11 September by the military regime ofMajor Pierre Buyoya  are steps in the right direction. Mydelegation  however  wishes to underscore the point thatchanges of Government should occur only throughconstitutional and internationally accepted means.Therefore  unless and until a constitutional Government isestablished in Burundi  my Government will continue towithhold recognition of the Buyoya regime. The immediateaction of the countries of the Great Lakes region to imposesanctions on Burundi following the coup d’état of 25 July1996 deserves the commendation of the United Nations.There is no doubt that this action is what has forced themilitary Government in Burundi to restore the parliamentand to unban political parties.We are encouraged with regard to Rwanda by the factthat the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda hasfinally been established and that its work has started. It isvitally important that the perpetrators of genocide inRwanda in 1994 should be brought to justice. This wouldserve as a deterrent to others who would otherwise betempted to commit similar crimes. The re-emergence ofgenocide  war crimes and other crimes against humanityshould be a source of great worry to the internationalcommunity. Such crimes should not be allowed to continue because they violate fundamental human rights and strikeat the very foundation of the international legal system.The Economic Community of West African StatesMonitoring Group (ECOMOG) has done an admirable jobof containing the situation in Liberia and preventing it fromdegenerating further. We are now seeing more promisingsteps towards the settlement of the conflict in Liberia. Thegains achieved in Liberia can only be consolidated by thecontinued support of the international community forECOMOG so that the timetable adopted at the recent Abujasummit can be effectively implemented.The peace process in Angola is also on track  asevidenced by the quartering and disarmament  which arenow almost complete after some extensions. The Assemblyis also aware that only two days ago the situation in Angolawas deliberated upon by Heads of State or Government ofthe Southern African Development Community in order tobring the leadership of the Movimento Popular deLibertação de Angola-Partido Trabalhista (MPLA) and theUnião Nacional para a Independência Total de Angola(UNITA) together. Unfortunately  the UNITA leader Mr. Jonas Savimbi failed to attend.Efforts to bring peace to Angola will neverthelesscontinue. The regional summit on Angola demonstratedthe strong commitment of the leaders of southern Africato the resolution of the conflict in Angola. However  theinternational community needs to be continuouslyengaged in order to ensure that the situation is resolved.We urge that the integration of former UNITA guerrillasinto the national army of Angola be speeded up toconsolidate the peace process. Zambia would also like tourge Mr. Jonas Savimbi and other UNITA leaders to bemore resolute in the implementation of the commitmentsthey made in the Lusaka Protocol.I wish to take this opportunity to commend theSpecial Representative of the Secretary-General onAngola  Mr. Alioune Blondin Beye  for the good work hehas done in the Angolan peace process. However  evenwhen peace finally comes to Angola  it will be importantfor the international community to provide assistance tothat country in areas that will facilitate rapid nationalreconstruction  such as mine clearance.The issue of Western Sahara continues to be Africa’slast unresolved colonial question. My delegation believesthat it is not beyond the wisdom of this Assembly toovercome whatever obstacles may be standing in the wayof a referendum. We would therefore like to appeal to theprincipal parties to cooperate with the Secretary-Generalin finding a lasting solution to this problem.With regard to Somalia  my delegation is concernedat the apparent lack of efforts by the internationalcommunity towards finding a lasting solution to the crisisin that country. The situation in Somalia is also notconducive to regional peace and security. We thereforecall upon the international community to seek ways andmeans through appropriate organs to assist the people ofSomalia to reach accommodation with each other  just aswe call on the Somali factions themselves to worktowards a genuine political settlement so that peace mayreturn to that country.The situation in the Middle East is a source of greatdanger to regional peace and security. We urge the partiesto the conflict not to abandon but to consolidate the peaceprocess brought about through sacrifice and painstakingwork. The violent confrontation that has taken place inthe past three days is a matter of grave concern to us.Zambia still believes  however  that the parties will3harness the moral courage and the political will that arenecessary to return to the peace process. Zambia believesthat for the peace process to restart and gain momentum the new Government in Israel should respect and implementthe agreements already reached on the Middle East peaceprocess  in accordance with the norms of international law.Since its inception  the United Nations has faced thechallenge of facilitating effective international economiccooperation. However  we have yet to attain a satisfactorylevel where countries of the world can pursue prospects fordevelopment through the machinery of the Organization.Multilateralism is indispensable to the management of theprocess of the globalization of the world economy that isnow going on. Major issues like foreign direct investment currency stability  external debt problems  internationaltrade and commodity price stabilization require durablemultilateral cooperative arrangements.It is the hope of my delegation that the current worktaking place at the United Nations on an Agenda forDevelopment  the strengthening of the United Nations andprospective new modalities for financing operationalactivities for development will generate possibilities toimplement fully the provisions of Chapter IX of the Charterof the United Nations. It is also the hope of my delegationthat the reform of the Bretton Woods institutions will notfurther erode the capacity of the United Nations to dealwith economic questions.It is  however  a matter of concern to my delegationthat United Nations agencies and departments are facingbudget cuts because of the continuing financial crisis of theworld body. Our concern is heightened by the fact that inMarch this year  the United Nations embarked on a decade-long process of promoting African development through itsSystem-wide Special Initiative for Africa. The UnitedNations  which is at the centre of the implementation of theSpecial Initiative  requires strong institutional capacities.The continuing financial crisis is certainly going to erodethis institutional capacity further.The Special Initiative and the Zambian economicreform programme complement each other. We hope thatthis is also the case with other African countries. We arealso particularly happy that the Special Initiative givesprominence to peace-building  conflict resolution  nationalreconciliation and strengthening of the capacity forgovernance in the wide agenda of socio-economicdevelopment on the African continent. As is well known economic progress in Africa has all too often beenundermined by conflicts.As the international community supports Africandevelopment  we once again draw its attention to theburden of external debt that is stunting Africandevelopment. Both the Special Initiative and the UnitedNations New Agenda for the Development of Africa inthe 1990s recognize that the major obstacle to sustainedeconomic growth and development is the problem ofexternal debt. It is the expectation of my delegation thatdeeper debt reduction going beyond the Naples terms canbe agreed upon in the near future. Deep debt reductionwill go a long way in facilitating domestic savings andinvestments in Africa  especially in the social sectors  andthereby reduce poverty  environmental degradation anddependency on aid.Before I conclude  I should say a few words aboutthe political situation in Zambia. In November 1991  mycountry embarked on a multi-party democratic process.We are almost at the end of the first five-year period ofdemocratization. Zambia will hold presidential andparliamentary elections this year under conditions of firmpolitical stability. We are determined to maintain thisstability by ensuring that peace prevails throughout theelection period. The Movement for MultipartyDemocracy  which is currently running the Government has been unequivocal in condemning all forms of politicalviolence and intolerance.There is no political crisis in Zambia. The people ofZambia have continued with their daily lives in peace security and full confidence in the political process of thecountry. In order to demonstrate good faith in the conductof the democratic process  the Government of Zambia hasinvited international observers to participate in monitoringour elections. These are in addition to local independentelection monitors. It is our desire that as many observersas possible should participate in this process  which isaimed at consolidating democracy.Zambia believes that the ideals of the United Nationsare indispensable to the development of the partnership ofcountries. It is therefore the supreme duty of all of us topromote and uphold them. In this context  I would like toconclude by reaffirming the faith of my delegation in theideals of the United Nations."
"181",7656,"ZWE",51,1996,"﻿I congratulateMr. Razali on his election to the presidency of theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-first session. We are morethan convinced that his vast experience and diplomaticskills will prove to be vital assets at this session of theAssembly. I assure him that my delegation will cooperatefully with him in the fulfilment of his onerousresponsibilities.Furthermore  I would like to pay tribute to hispredecessor  Professor Diogo Freitas do Amaral  whosteered the work of the Assembly through its historicfiftieth anniversary in a commendable and honourableway.Our tribute also goes to the Secretary-GeneralBoutros Boutros-Ghali for his distinguished leadership ofour Organization during the past year. We are especiallygrateful to him for his tireless efforts to enhance theOrganization’s role in maintaining international peace andsecurity as well as in promoting international economicdevelopment and cooperation.At the last session of the General Assembly  whenwe celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the UnitedNations  we witnessed the largest-ever gathering of Headsof State and Government. On that occasion  the worldleaders made a historic reaffirmation of our commitmentto the purposes and principles of this Organization asenshrined in the Charter. Besides taking stock of theprogress made and the lessons learnt during the past 50years  the world leaders endeavoured not only torecapture the vision of the founding fathers of the UnitedNations  but also to chart the institutional framework andoperational parameters that could enhance theOrganization’s relevance and effectiveness in a changedinternational landscape. My delegation sincerely hopesthat we will all be able to take full advantage of thisrenewed commitment to the Organization to ensure thatthe United Nations system as a whole is reformed revitalized and rendered more efficacious  transparent accountable and democratic.The United Nations  as the universally acceptedmatrix of multilateralism  must  in the post-cold-war era play a vastly expanded role in the domain of peace-keeping and make a positive contribution to the newphenomenon of globalization and its increased levels ofeconomic and social interdependence  as well as thetechnologically fuelled transnational linkages among thecountries of the world. The Organization therefore facesan inescapable imperative for reform and revitalization.16In this regard  my delegation is deeply perturbed bythe slow progress made by the Open-ended Working Groupon the Question of Equitable Representation on andIncrease in the Membership of the Security Council. We inAfrica maintain that the present arrangement  in whichAfrica and Latin America have no permanentrepresentatives on the Security Council  while Asia has onlyone  is unjust and antidemocratic and must not be allowedto continue. Those three regions should each have at leasttwo permanent seats  with incumbents enjoying the samerights and privileges as the present permanent members.Additional non-permanent seats should also be allocated toeach of those regions so as to ensure equitable geographicalrepresentation proportionate to the numerical strength ofeach region in this Organization.In other areas of reform  our primary objective shouldbe to reaffirm the role of the General Assembly as thehighest decision-making body in the entire United Nationssystem. Any process of restructuring  revitalization orstrengthening should necessarily redress the erosion of theprinciple of the accountability of all principal andsubsidiary organs and specialized agencies of the UnitedNations to the General Assembly. My delegation willtherefore seek resolutely to uphold the authority of theGeneral Assembly as enshrined in the Charter and consequently  will oppose any proposals orrecommendations that might lead to the usurpation of theauthority of the General Assembly under any guise or form.Accordingly  we will not agree to authorizing theSecretariat to amend  postpone or cancel any officialprogramme activities without the express approval of theGeneral Assembly  whose prerogative it is to give  changeor withdraw the mandates of such programme activities.My delegation is of the strong view that reform shouldnot necessarily be equated with the downsizing of theUnited Nations system. We also feel that an optimallystreamlined and strengthened United Nations system willnot necessarily be responsive to the needs of itsmembership as long as it is subjected to chronic cash-flowproblems. The appalling record of some Member States thatdishonour their financial obligations to the United Nationsand our endless lamentations over the resultant financialcrises have clearly brought into question the credibility ofthe Organization and the commitment of its membership. Inour view  the time is long past for us to re-examine all theefforts that we have been exerting in an endeavour toidentify and agree on the formulation and mechanisms todeal with the current financial crisis that has beset theOrganization. Unless Member States take serious steps toclear their arrears and improve their payment pattern byremitting their assessed contributions promptly  in full andwithout conditions  the United Nations will continue todither on the brink of bankruptcy and its efficacy will betotally compromised. It is imperative that we  the MemberStates  create a capacity for the Organization to fulfil themandate we have given to it.The United Nations’ role in maintaining internationalpeace and security must of necessity have a global thrustin both the geographical sense and the conceptualframework. Peace-threatening conflicts in any part of ourglobal village should never be seen to attract differentialattention depending upon their geographical location strategic interest  ethnic complexion or such other narrowconsiderations of the big Powers.The much-belated intervention and subsequentfailure of the United Nations in Somalia and its half-hearted interventions in Rwanda  Burundi and Liberiahave exposed the Organization to harmful criticism  whichhas led to a further decline in its credibility. UnitedNations peacekeeping efforts in Africa have generally metwith mixed fortunes. We have yet to see the Namibianand Mozambican success stories repeat themselves inseveral other trouble spots on the continent.Although the peace process in Angola continues torun behind schedule  we are persuaded that the seeds oflasting peace have been sown in that country. We need toredouble our efforts in urging the Angolans to perseverealong the present bumpy road of peace on the basis ofnational reconciliation and unity.Although the humanitarian situation in Somalia hasimproved somewhat since the intervention of the UnitedNations  that country remains in political turmoil fromwhich it cannot rescue itself fully without the sustainedinvolvement of the international community. We thereforecall upon the international community  through the UnitedNations  to review its current minimalist approach toSomalia  explore new possibilities for constructiveengagement and give peace another chance.In Burundi  the fundamental challenge of havingdemocracy with security has now been compounded bythe need to stop generalized violence and to return thecountry to constitutionality. The United Nations shouldsupport the sterling efforts of Burundi’s neighbours toassist that country to achieve peace and stability. Thetragedy of genocide in Rwanda must not be allowed torepeat itself in Burundi. No!17In Liberia  brute force and violence must not beallowed to triumph. The parties should be made to honourthe peace agreement already reached through the goodoffices of the Economic Community of West AfricanStates. The people of Liberia have suffered enough. TheUnited Nations must send a clear message to the warlordsin that country that our common humanity may soon impelus to try them for war crimes and crimes against humanity.With regard to the stalled peace process in WesternSahara  it is imperative that the international community through the United Nations  honour the spirit and letter ofthe commitment it made to the disenfranchised people ofthat territory and ensure that a free and fair United Nations-supervised referendum takes place there on the basis of theUnited Nations Settlement Plan for Western Sahara.In the Middle East  we appeal to the new Governmentof Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization tocontinue on the path of peace and reason  as espoused bythe late Prime Minister of Israel  Mr. Yitzhak Rabin  whopaid with his life that the two peoples might live togetherin peace and harmony. Renewing the construction ofsettlements on Palestinian land is no contribution to peace.It undermines the peace process. There is no alternative topeace. We therefore urge the parties to remain committedto the peace process until Palestinian self-determination anda Palestinian State become realities. It is only in thiscontext that the security of Israel can be guaranteed.Commitment to peace has remained the centrepiece ofthe Non-Aligned Movement. Thirty-five years ago  thefounding fathers of this Movement had a vision of a world inter alia  living in peace and harmony  free of nuclearthreat and super-Power rivalry. Two days ago  we hadoccasion to commemorate that vision. We found it to be asrelevant and powerful today as when it was first articulated35 years ago. We recommitted ourselves  among otherthings  to pursuing the goal of a world at peace  free fromthe threat of weapons of mass destruction. We reaffirmedthat complete nuclear disarmament is a sine qua non for thesurvival of humanity on our planet. We therefore appeal toall nuclear Powers to agree to ban the production  testingand use or threat of use of nuclear weapons and otherweapons of Armageddon.To enhance this Organization’s accountability andcredibility  the decision-making process with regard toUnited Nations peace-keeping mandates must cater to anincreased role for the general membership of theOrganization  starting with troop-contributing countries.Furthermore  efforts such as those which entail preventivediplomacy and post-conflict peace-building  as spelled outin the Secretary-General’s report  “Supplement to anAgenda for Peace”  clearly fall within the domain of theGeneral Assembly. Moreover  it is our view that theUnited Nations is the only Organization which is uniquelycharged with a global mandate to maintain internationalpeace and security. This means therefore that regionalpeace-keeping efforts can only complement and notsubstitute the leading role of the United Nations.The United Nations should also enhance its role inpromoting international cooperation in other spheres of itscompetence  particularly that of trade. Only a few monthsago  the international community celebrated the successfullaunching of the World Trade Organization  followingprotracted multilateral trade negotiations. For this newmultilateral trade regime to work  it is imperative thatmember States resist the temptation to initiate practices orpolicies that seek to compromise the sovereignty of othermember States or to reintroduce colonialism in anotherguise. Developed countries should live up to theircommitments and abandon protectionist policies if allcountries are to benefit from the new tradingarrangements. Improved market access and increasedforeign direct investment must be accompanied by newand innovative ways to tackle the debt burden ofdeveloping countries  with a view to finding acomprehensive and once-and-for-all solution to the debtproblem.Given the negative economic trends in some of ourcountries  the developed countries and internationalfinancial institutions should seriously consider debt-forgiveness for low-income developing countries. Such acourse of action would stop the flight of much-neededresources from these countries and create new possibilitiesfor real savings for investment and growth. I wish toaffirm that we  the developing countries  fully accept andrecognize that we bear the primary responsibility for ourown development; we have accordingly undertakenvarious economic structural adjustment reforms  often atenormous social and political cost. These ambitious andpainful reforms could flounder if developed countries failto complement these sterling efforts by taking decisivemeasures to reduce the stock of our debt and by removingthe wall of protectionist barriers. We also call on thedeveloped countries to take decisive measures  as a matteror urgency  to increase the flow of official developmentassistance  private investment and the transfer oftechnologies to developing nations.18In a few days  world leaders will assemble in Romefor yet another world summit. This time  the internationalcommunity will focus its attention on the importantquestion of food security and the good health of the peopleof the world. Unfortunately  even the increased foodsupplies in the world are inaccessible to more than 1.5billion hungry people who are acknowledged to be living inabject poverty. We cannot accept that the legacy of hungryand malnourished people is what our generation willbequeath to the twenty-first century.We expect development to bring food to our diningtables  clean water into our homes  better housing improved health and security to all our children. Thepresent trend towards globalization and the deepeninginterdependence among economies should foster a universalfeeling and sense of belonging to the global village whoseconcept we have now come to take for granted  but whosebenefits accrue to only a few countries.Only last week  this Assembly carried out a review ofthe United Nations New Agenda for the Development ofAfrica in the 1990s. In the statements made byrepresentatives of African countries  it was madeabundantly clear that the international commitments madein 1991  like those made at the launching of United NationsProgramme of Action for African Economic Recovery andDevelopment 1986-1990 earlier  had not been fulfilled. Wetherefore call on the international community  and ourdevelopment partners in particular  to mobilize the requisitefinancial resources to augment our efforts and give freshimpetus to the realization of the goals set out in UnitedNations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the1990s.When the founding fathers of the United Nationsoutlined the purposes and principles of this Organization they envisioned a United Nations that would“be a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations inthe attainment of these common ends.”As we seek to enhance the relevance of thisOrganization to the world today  it is imperative that weunderstand that the vast majority of the people of this worldexpect the United Nations to be a principal actor forprogress and change  and to be equipped to play aneffective and leading role in improving the economic andsocial situation of the world’s citizens. As wecommemorate the International Year for the Eradication ofPoverty  we are alarmed at the growing extent of abjectpoverty  which now engulfs 20 per cent of the world’spopulation. That poverty is the root cause of most of theworld’s social ills  including strife and peace-threateningconflicts  cannot be overemphasized. We appeal toGovernments the world over to respond in earnest to theclarion call of the Copenhagen world social summit andto spare no effort at both the national and internationallevels  to roll back the advancing scourge of poverty.It is needless to stress that the elimination of povertyand the attainment of the broader goal of sustainabledevelopment will remain impossible to achieve unlessnations show renewed political resolve to implementpolicies aimed at enabling humankind to better manageand live with its environment  as agreed to at the Riode Janeiro summit and at subsequent Conferences. Theever-dwindling natural resource base  global warming persistent droughts and desertification are eloquentreminders that humankind’s current destructive processesof growth are pushing our planet towards the precipice.Under these circumstances  the search for safer environmentally sound and sustainable approaches todevelopment  including the utilization of new andrenewable resources  has become more urgent now thanever before.Only last week  leaders from 103 countries  from allregions of the world  heeding this historic challenge ofour time  gathered in Harare  Zimbabwe  for the first-everWorld Solar Summit to map out strategies aimed atpromoting the development and utilization of solar andother forms of renewable energy. In recognition of theimportant role that solar energy can play in theadvancement of socio-economic development and inreducing environmental degradation  the Summit adopteda comprehensive World Solar Programme 1996-2005 witha view to creating effective mechanisms to speed up andfacilitate the use of solar energy. We call upon the UnitedNations Secretary-General  the specialized agencies of theUnited Nations  non-governmental organizations and theinternational community at large to lend the necessaryfinancial and other forms of support to the Programme toenable it to succeed.In June 1997 another conference of equalenvironmental significance  the International Conventionon Trade in Endangered Species (CITES)  will convenein Harare. The challenges facing this conference will byno means be small. Global conservation strategies andpolicies have to be implemented in the national interestand within the means available for the benefit of eachcountry. We in southern Africa have adopted effectiveconservation policies over the years that have seen the19growth of our elephant herd beyond the levels ourecosystem can support. It would be unfortunate  and indeedan irony of our times  if we  who have conceived andsuccessfully implemented innovative wildlife conservationpolicies  should find ourselves being penalized for oursuccess and the failure of others. The internationalcommunity has an obligation to adopt new  dynamic andflexible policies that would enable countries such as SouthAfrica  Namibia  Botswana and my own country to reap thebenefits of their wildlife conservation successes. To actotherwise would be counter-productive and an injustice tothe noble cause of wildlife conservation as a whole. Mycountry intends to make constructive suggestions on thissubject at the CITES meeting next year.To remain relevant and effective  the United Nationsmust stay at the centre stage of global activities. Itsworldwide responsibilities cannot be delegated; nor can itsCharter-enshrined priorities be subordinated to issuesextraneous to its purposes and principles. We are takenaback by the efforts of those who seek to prescribe to theUnited Nations a reform exercise that would force theOrganization to diminish and to reorient its Charter-enshrined role in promoting development to the BrettonWoods institutions  the World Trade Organization and theblind forces of the market. The Charter envisaged anidentifiable role for the United Nations in promotingdevelopment  which is a prerequisite for  and the ultimatecorollary of  peace.My delegation maintains that the United Nations isuniquely placed to play a policy-making and resourceidentification role. Its decisions must necessarily set thepace and direction for other institutions such as the BrettonWoods institutions and the World Trade Organization.In conclusion  the strength of the United Nations liesin its universality and its impartiality in implementing itsmandate to promote peace and security  economic andsocial development  human rights and international law asoutlined in its Charter.Whereas the Organization has clearly played asignificant role in the containment and settlement ofdisputes through peace-keeping activities  and in theexpansion and codification of international law  it haslargely failed to have any significant impact on thedevelopment process in developing countries. The fewdeveloping countries that have managed to score anybreakthroughs have done so in spite of the United Nations.As the General Assembly outlines its medium-term plan forthe period 1998-2003  my delegation  together with others will seek to ensure that the development process particularly Africa’s economic recovery and development is underwritten by the Organization’s irrevocablecommitment.Finally  let me turn to the agenda item dealing withthe election of the Secretary-General of this Organization.Since it is an item on the agenda of this Assembly  it isimperative that Member States freely express their viewson this matter. We of Africa have a clear andunambiguous position. We believe that it is Africa’s turnto provide a Secretary-General. We have had one term sofar and  following the normal practice  are entitled to asecond term. The African leaders  meeting in Yaoundé Cameroon  this year  endorsed the candidature of theincumbent  His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali.We stand ready to engage all Members of thisOrganization in the process of finalizing consultations onthis subject."
